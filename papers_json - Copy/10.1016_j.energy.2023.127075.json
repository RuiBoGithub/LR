Demand side management (DSM) and net metering (NM) are two important strategies that can be used in smart energy management systems to help utilities reduce peak loads and increase the penetration of renewable energy, while also enabling customers to save energy and reduce energy bills. In order to effectively implement DSM and NM programs, it is important to identify the customers who are most likely to benefit from these programs and to quantify the economic impact and benefit for both utilities and end-users. This paper proposes a decision framework that utilizes smart meter data and clustering analysis to identify representative load patterns, and a five-stage method for segmenting load patterns to create a consumption intensity matrix. A fuzzy ensemble based multi-criteria decision making framework is then applied to identify the most potential customer groups and quantify the economic benefit and impact. This paper presents a novel approach for identifying potential customers for DSM and NM programs and developing personalized services for energy demand management. The proposed framework is evaluated through a case study, which demonstrates its robustness in decision making and identifies 13 typical load patterns, seven for weekdays and six for weekends, representing diverse consumption behaviors. The weekday load patterns perform better than the weekend load patterns in terms of the five-stage method.

For example, the residential sector in European countries consumes approximately 40% of the total energy demand and 36% of carbon emissions [1]. As a result, residential buildings offer great potential for energy savings and carbon reduction. Utilities often promote energy saving programs, provide energy efficiency advice, and encourage the transition from consumer to prosumer by implementing private renewable energy devices, such as solar panels and wind turbines [2]. Among them, demand side management (DSM) plays a key role, which can help utilities understand consumer behaviors [3]. It is defined as \u201cplanning and implementation of those electric utility activities designed to influence customer uses of electricity in ways that will produce desired changes in the utility\u2019s load shape\u201d [4]. DSM emphasizes the integration of energy saving techniques, variable or dynamic unit pricing, and demand response programs to reduce peak load, instead of meeting demand with new capacity or generation sources. Fig. 1 depicts the DSM concept from the consumer and operator\u2019s perspective, and the operator\u2019s perspectives are including the transmission system operator (TSO) and distribution system operator (DSO). As can be seen, DSM can obtain peak load management through four strategies: energy efficiency (EE), time-of-use (TOU), spinning reserve (SR), and demand response (DR). For customers, they can respond to TOU in near real-time, schedule the use of appliances, and contribute to grid stability by changing consumption behavior. For operators, DSM can help reduce peak loads and investments for higher capacity; and help increase the penetration of renewable energy [5]. NM is a billing mechanism that enables prosumers, or individuals who both produce and consume energy, to receive credits for excess energy production or bills for net energy use. This is often accomplished through the use of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, which may generate more electricity, denoted by E p v , than a household consumes, E c o n s (as illustrated in Fig. 2). Any surplus electricity, E s r p l , can be fed back into the grid, and utilities can provide credits to the household in exchange. If total consumption, E c o n s , exceeds E p v , the household is only responsible for paying for the net consumption, i.e., E i n = E c o n s − E p v . In theory, a household with a large enough solar PV system could achieve a zero energy bill for the entire year by selling any surplus energy, E s r p l , back to the grid to earn credits. DSM is a strategy aimed at saving energy by encouraging customers to use less energy or to shift their energy use away from peak periods [6]. As more renewable energy sources, particularly solar energy, are integrated into smart grids [7,8], the use of NM schemes to enable solar energy to meet all or part of a customer\u2019s energy demand becomes increasingly important. As such, it is necessary to consider the implementation of DSM and NM programs, as well as identify suitable customers for energy management initiatives. The main objective of this study is to identify potential customers for DSM and NM programs, and quantify the economic benefit and impact for both the end-users and utilities. To achieve this, we propose a novel fuzzy ensemble Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) decision framework. This framework allows for a more comprehensive and robust evaluation of different customer groups, based on their load patterns and consumption intensity. We first apply fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering analysis [9] on daily load profiles to identify representative consumption patterns. Based on these patterns, we perform a five-stage segmentation analysis to obtain consumption intensity matrices for weekdays and weekends, which serve as input for the decision system. The decision is made based on the fuzzy ensemble MCDM framework, which employs ranking techniques including Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) [10] and Vise Kriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) [11]. The identification of potential customers for DSM and NM programs is important for both utilities and customers. For utilities, these programs can help reduce peak loads and investments for higher capacity, and increase the penetration of renewable energy [5]. For customers, DSM programs can encourage the use of energy-efficient appliances and behavior changes, leading to energy savings and reduced energy bills. NM enables prosumers to sell surplus energy back to the grid and receive credits, potentially leading to a zero energy bill for the entire year. Quantifying the economic benefit and impact of DSM and NM can help to understand the value of these programs for both the end-users and utilities. The proposed decision framework for identifying potential customers for DSM and NM programs and quantifying the economic benefit and impact for both the end-users and utilities has significant practical and research value. By utilizing smart meter data and applying clustering analysis and a fuzzy ensemble based multi-criteria decision making framework, utilities can more effectively target and design DSM and NM programs for different customer groups, leading to increased energy savings and renewable energy integration. This framework can also help utilities better understand and respond to diverse consumption behaviors, and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of energy demand management efforts. The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows: \u2022 We propose a novel fuzzy ensemble MCDM decision framework for the identification of customers for DSM and NM programs. \u2022 We present the methodology for developing personalized services for energy demand management. In this paper, we have proposed and incorporated a set of novel technologies and concepts, including FCM clustering analysis, a five-stage method for daily load profile segmentation, consumption intensity matrix, and fuzzy ensemble MCDM to identify the potential customer groups. \u2022 We evaluate the proposed decision framework comprehensively through a case study using a real-world dataset, and the results validated the effectiveness of the proposed method. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature on clustering, DSM and NM and multi-criteria decision making. Section 3 presents the details of the decision framework. Section 4 provides a case study to evaluate the framework. Section 5 concludes the paper and presents future research directions. 2 Literature review 2.1 Clustering approach in smart meter data Clustering is a widely used data mining technique that organizes data points into different groups based on their similarity [12]. In the context of smart meter data mining, clustering is often used to segment customers according to their energy consumption patterns, which can be useful for utilities seeking to improve demand-side management through initiatives such as tariff design [13], customer demand-response options [14], and energy efficiency programs [15]. K-means clustering has been used to segment households in order to understand the factors that influence energy consumption for different groups, as demonstrated in the study by Ofetotse et al. [16]. This work applied k-means clustering to 310 households in a locality in Botswana and identified four distinct groups. Bourdeau et al. [17] used k-means clustering on the time series of daily electric load profiles for 14 higher education buildings on the same campus, finding that teaching, research, library, and gymnasium buildings had similar patterns that could be organized into two clusters corresponding to business days and non-business days. Rasanen et al. [18] used self-organizing maps (SOM), k-means, and hierarchical clustering techniques to cluster large amounts of electricity consumption data for 3,989 small customers in Northern-Savo, Finland, and calculate representative load curves for each user group. Clustering can also be used to improve the accuracy of energy consumption predictions. For example, the study by Chen et al. [19] applied fuzzy C-means clustering to a day-ahead prediction model of electricity consumption and found that clustering significantly improved the accuracy of the predictions. In order to identify the most suitable cluster validation indices (CVIs) for a particular dataset, Jain et al. [20] examined the impact of different CVIs on a typical residential load demand dataset, as well as the features of the data that preferred or prohibited the use of certain CVIs. Finally, Niu et al. [21,22] proposed a novel spatiotemporal clustering method that allows users to interactively identify different customer groups and their characteristics through a visual analysis approach, improving the usability of clustering analysis techniques. There are a variety of clustering techniques available, including hierarchical, density-based, grid-based, partitioning, and feature-based methods [23]. Among these, partitioning-based clustering techniques are often the most widely used for time series data, and the K-Means clustering method is frequently employed for shape-related load patterns due to its efficiency with large datasets [24]. However, traditional K-Means methods can smooth out temporal variations and may lose important features [25]. They are also sensitive to outliers and noise, which can result in narrow class margins between clusters and limit the interpretability of centroids [26]. Additionally, traditional K-Means methods use hard clustering, where each sample can belong to only one class, which can lead to the loss of key features [27]. FCM clustering, on the other hand, overcomes these drawbacks by providing flexible fuzzy means that allow each sample to belong to multiple groups with different degrees of membership. This can be more effective than traditional hard-threshold clustering, where each point is assigned a specific and unique label. Therefore, in this work, we use FCM to identify patterns in smart meter data. 2.2 DSM and NM Some researchers have explored DSM strategies for customers DR and EE. Xue et al. [28] designed a DSM strategy to quickly respond to demand by shutting off the chillers during DR. The results showed that the DSM strategy could reduce the electricity consumption of the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system from 32.04% to 66.45% and the predicted dissatisfaction index percentage was less than 10%. There have also been several DSM studies with clustering of electricity consumption profiles. Liang et al. [29] proposed a method for aggregating household load curves into a two-tier loading curve dictionary for the purpose of load forecasting. In their findings, two levels of load were used to obtain representative load profiles based on consumption information. Similarly, Zuniga et al. [30] have proposed an adaptive clustering method employing K-means to identify customers with the highest electricity consumption to decrease total demand, and their results show that the clustering algorithm based K-means have a advantage to evaluate those consumers with high consumption to help save energy. Furthermore, Sun et al. [31] proposed a probability-based clustering method to estimate the baseline of customers. They found that those customers who used by time were included in the analysis to account for uncertainty in the household-level baseline loads. This approach provides a new ideal for mining different types of users for DSM and NM, which is different from traditional clustering methods. In other similar studies, a motive-based associations search approach was proposed [32] to identify expected and undesired DSM patterns from electricity consumption data. But their suggested approach is restricted to the detection of these patterns without generality. Besides, some scholars aim to explore the daily consuming change trend to handle peak demand shifting, such as in [33], they attempt to reveal typical load patterns they focus on primarily on the determination of peak demand times. In general, it is clear that some contributions have been made to the study of potential customers for DSM or NM by using different clustering methods to classify electricity consumption patterns into representative profiles. However, DSM is an energy saving strategy, and a refined analysis of electricity consumption patterns is necessary in order to promote the efficiency and effectiveness of DSM solutions for heterogeneous customers. It is critical that detecting consuming peaks in a day for identifying for every household to meet the DSM or NM. Moreover, earlier studies have also noted a lack or partial lack of research into typical load profiles characterized by different daily load characteristics, which would have facilitated a reasoned decision on the capabilities of the consumers. Here, we would try to evaluate each cluster\u2019s load pattern as a unite for DSM and NM programs. 2.3 Multi-criteria decision making MCDM is considered a dynamic and complex method that supports decision making in management engineering [34], and has also been introduced to decision making in energy operations, e.g., [35]. The Technique of Ordered Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) became one of the most favored energy sector problem-solving approaches thanks to its relatively logical and rational [36], and the alternative with the shortest distance from the positive ideal solution and the longest distance from the negative ideal solution is selected. As TOPSIS can make good use of distributed information, it does not take into account correlations between attributes, and a strongly deviating performance from the ideal solution can have a significant impact on the results [37]. In addition, Vise Kriterijumska Optimizacija Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) takes the advantage of maximizing \u201cgroup utility\u201d for the \u201cmajority\u201d and minimizing \u201cindividual regret\u201d for the \u201copponent\u201d [38]. VIKOR is able to develop a ranking with several, usually conflicting, alternative criteria, analyzing proximity to the ideal solution, but VIKOR requires initial weights and quantitative information to work [34]. Thus, we will focus on these two ideal solution-based methods, with multiple combinations of objective weighting and normalization. By combining the two methods, this approach can overcome the shortcomings of TOPSIS and VIKOR. Although MCDM has evolved considerably towards applications in energy, some limitations have also been identified. Ref. [39] argues that there is a complexity of energy scheduling, due to the combination of two different methods. The inconsistent results between the approaches with uncertain decision endpoints require appropriate quantitative methods to deal with inaccuracy and assess the impact of uncertainties on the final results. Ref. [40] found that MCDM results can easily be altered, due to the alternative characteristics of the basic assumptions, such as criterion weights. Hence, it is necessary to create alternative rankings using different weighting, normalization, and ranking methods for stabilizing a proper ranking. Ensemble learning is an expression of the wisdom of crowds. The idea of ensemble learning can be explained as the tendency to gather different opinions and information and to weigh and combine them in order to make complex and rational decisions. This means that it is better to gather a group of ideas rather than to choose only one from all [41]. In this paper, after obtaining representative load profiles by clustering analysis, we aim to apply a decision framework to identify customer groups for DSM and NM programs. We use a fuzzy ensemble method to make a final ranking for individual households of each cluster. The ranking result can be used as a guide to prioritize the implementation of DSM and NM programs for households. Furthermore, the proposed decision framework can also be applied to similar problems in other domains, especially when there are multiple alternatives and criteria to be considered. 3 Methodology In this section, we will present the methodology to reveal potential customers for demand side management and net metering programs. First, we will provide an overview of the proposed method and then describe the key components of the method in detail. 3.1 Overview Fig. 3 shows an overview of the proposed framework, which consists of two consecutive processing components, including the identification of representative load patterns by clustering and the decision support framework for DSM and NM. In the first component, we focus on clustering energy consumption data to obtain representative load patterns for different customer groups. It consists of the following four steps. First, residential consumption data, along with associated scio-economic data, were collected from various sources, such as smart meters, residential households, power plant, and transmission. In this study, we used open data from Pecan Street [42]. Then, the data are cleaned and processed to satisfy the subsequent analysis purpose. Specifically, this involves fixing missing and null values, applying outlier removal techniques (by isolation forest in this study), and normalizing the data. Third, the Fuzzy c-Means algorithm is applied to identify representative load patterns of different customer groups, where the Silhouette coefficient index is used to explore the best number of clusters. Finally, we divide the representative load patterns using a five-step method (see Section 3.4), and compute the consumption intensity matrix, M , for the weekday and weekend. The intensity matrix will be provided as input to the decision-making component. In the second component, we propose a decision support framework for evaluating potential customers for DSM and ND programs, which involves the following steps. First, the input decision matrix M will be weighted by the methods including Standard Deviation, Entropy, Angle, Gini, and Criterion Importance by Intercriteria (CRITIC) [43], resulting in the weighted matrix w j ; and normalized by the methods including Max, Vector, MinMax and Enhanced [44], resulting in the matrix m ¯ i j . Then, the two matrices are used to compute m ranking data sets R m × i , where the evaluation approaches, VIKOR and TOPSIS, are used. Finally, an ensemble method is applied to obtain the final ranking R ¯ i , which uses a fuzzy membership function derived from the Cauchy fuzzy distribution algorithm. Sensitivity analysis is performed as part of ensemble learning. 3.2 Data pre-processing Data preprocessing is a crucial step in the data analysis process, as it allows for the identification and correction of issues such as missing or null values and outliers. In this study, we utilized open data from Pecan Street [42] for our analysis. To address missing or null values, we removed any time series with more than 50% missing or null values. To identify and remove outliers, we utilized the isolated forest method [45]. This method involves constructing a forest of isolated trees and calculating an anomaly score for each data point based on the estimated average path length of search failures in a binary search tree. By implementing these data preprocessing steps, we were able to ensure that the data used in our analysis was of high quality and free from potential biases or inaccuracies introduced by missing or invalid data points. The isolated forest method for outlier detection involves calculating an anomaly score for each data point using Eqs. (1)\u2013(3). (1) s ( x , n ) = 2 − E ( h ( x ) ) C ( n ) where (2) C ( n ) = 2 H ( n − 1 ) − 2 ( n − 1 ) n (3) H ( n ) = ln ( n ) + 0 . 57772156649 In these equations, s ( x , n ) represents the anomaly score of the data point x , h ( x ) is the harmonic number determined by Eq. (3) (0.57772156649 is the Euler constant), E ( h ( x ) ) represents the average lengths of all h ( x ) values from a collection of isolation trees to isolate the data point x , and C ( n ) is the estimated average path length of search failures in a binary search tree. The procedure for outlier detection using the isolated forest method is described in Algorithm 1 (see Ref. [45] for more details). After data cleansing, the load profile for each customer is normalized in order to uncover the temporal fluctuation in the daily load profile. The Min-Max normalization approach is applied in this study. The daily load profile is classified as either a weekday ( w ) or a weekend ( e ), as electricity consumption generally differs between these two periods [46]. The original hourly readings are represented by x , while the normalized readings are represented by X . The normalization of readings on weekdays and weekends can be defined as follows: (4) X w , d , t n = x w , d , t n − min t x w , d , t n max t x w , d , t n − min t x w , d , t n (5) X e , d , t n = x e , d , t n − min t x e , d , t n max t x e , d , t n − min t x e , d , t n where x w , d , t n represents the reading at the hour t , on the day d , during the weekday w , for the customer n ; while x e , d , t n represents the reading during the weekend. min t { ⋅ } and max t { ⋅ } represent the minimum and maximum value among the readings at hour t from 0 to 23. 3.3 Load profile clustering by an Fuzzy c-Means algorithm As discussed before, the conventional K-Means algorithm is a hard clustering method, which means that it forces each data point to belong to a single cluster. In contrast, the FCM algorithm is a soft clustering method, which allows each sample to belong to multiple clusters with varying degrees of membership. In addition, the isolation forest method is used to detect outliers in the dataset, which helps to eliminate the influence of these outliers on the FCM method. This allows FCM to examine the variation in the consumption of each customer in our study. We use the FCM algorithm to segment customers based on their load patterns, specifically by the normalized daily load profile for weekdays and weekends, X w , d , t n and X e , d , t n , for all customers, i.e., n = 1 , \u2026 , N . Without loss of generality, the subset of weekday load profiles is used for clustering, with a given number of clusters, k . The Euclidean distance is used as the measure of similarity between two load profiles X i and X j , defined as: (6) E i , j = \u2016 X i − X j \u2016 2 where X i , X j ∈ X w , d , t n , and d ∈ D w which represent the total number of weekdays. Specifically, assuming that each data point belongs to each cluster with a corresponding fuzzy membership, the following formula defines a standard FCM objective function for clustering n data points into K clusters: (7) J f u z = ∑ j = 1 K ∑ i = 1 n μ i j b \u2016 X i − u j \u2016 2 where X i is the i th data point of X w , d , t n and n is the total number of X i , respectively; K is the predefined number of clusters; u j represents the outline or centroid of the j th cluster; μ i j stands for the fuzzy membership of the i th data point that belongs to the j th cluster, μ ∈ [0,1], and ∑ j = 1 K μ i j ≡ 1 . In addition, b is a weighting exponent parameter to explore the fuzzy level, whose value is 2 in most study cases. With the initialization for the first derivatives of J f u z by u j (j=1, \u2026, K ) and μ i j (i=1, \u2026, n ; j=1, \u2026, K ), respectively, we can update J f u z to obtain its optimum using the iterative equations of u j and μ i j defined as follows: (8) u j = ∑ i = 1 n μ i j b X i ∑ i = 1 n μ i j b (9) μ i j = 1 / E i , j 1 / ( b − 1 ) ∑ j = 1 K 1 / E i , j 1 / ( b − 1 ) In this stage, the formula (6) can be refined as: (10) E i , j = \u2016 X i − u j \u2016 2 Therefore, we can obtain the K representative load patterns X ˆ w in the end through the FCM, the set of cluster centroid index u ˆ w , and the set of membership matrix U . For a better understanding of FCM, we provide the pseudocode in Algorithm 2. Despite the sophistication and flexibility of the FCM clustering algorithm, the main challenge of FCM is how to determine the number of clusters K . Different methods have been proposed to determine the number of clusters [47], including the silhouette coefficient, elbow, and gap statistics methods. Among them, the Silhouette Coefficient index SC has received a lot of attention, which is a kind of internal index not sensitive to the initial value. In this study, we randomly choose the initial centroids and use SC to determine the number of clusters, as SC is not sensitive to the initial centroids. We now investigate how to find the number of clusters based on SC. SC contains two parts: the cohesion factor a ( i ) which represents the average distance between the load profile of the i th customer and another customer within the same cluster, and the separation factor b ( i ) which represents the minimum average distance between the load profiles of the i th customer and the j th customer who are in different clusters. a ( i ) and b ( i ) are defined as follows: (11) a ( i ) = ∑ j ∈ u ˆ w k , j ≠ i E i , j N k − 1 (12) b ( i ) = min k \u2032 ∈ { 1 , K } , k \u2032 ≠ k ∑ j ∈ u ˆ w k \u2032 E i , j N k \u2032 where k = 1, \u2026, K , and N k is the total number of load profiles in a cluster k . Then, SC i for the load profile of the i th customer is determined as: (13) SC i = b ( i ) − a ( i ) max b ( i ) , a ( i ) which can be used to reveal if the distribution of the i th customer is appropriate. Obviously, the smaller cohesion factor a ( i ) and the larger separation factor b ( i ) are better. The general fitness of the cluster can be studied by SC as (14) SC = ∑ i = 1 N w S C i N where N is the number of total load profiles in the dataset. The value of SC is within the interval [−1,1]. When the value of SC is close to 1, it is a preferable case. However, if SC is negative, especially close to −1, it can lead to bad clustering performance. 3.4 Daily load profile segmentation and intensity matrix The daily load profile of a household can vary significantly at different times of the day. For example, residential electrical load profiles typically have peaks in the morning and evening, but may have valleys in the middle of the day. Segmenting load profiles according to different times of the day allows us to better understand the consumption patterns of customers [48]. Therefore, we divide the typical daily load profiles into five stages, as illustrated in Fig. 4. These stages are described in detail below: (1) Morning stage: This stage is from 6 to 10 h, and represents the average consumption during this period. Most people use their kitchen appliances and engage in other activities related to electricity usage in the morning. (2) Continuous stage: This stage is from 10 to 15 h, immediately following the morning stage. During this stage, people may have left their homes or may still be using appliances. (3) Pre-peak stage: This stage is from 15 to 18 h, between the continuous stage and the peak stage. At this stage, people may change their consumption behavior in preparation for the peak stage. (4) Peak stage: This stage is from 18 to 24 h, and represents the highest level of consumption. During this stage, people typically use all of their electrical equipment, such as lights, television, and kitchenware. The peak fall can also be observed during this period. (5) Post-peak stage: This stage is from 0 to 3 h of the following day, immediately after the peak stage. During this period, we can observe whether people maintain their peak consumption or if there are changes. In the previous section, we used fuzzy c-means clustering to identify representative load patterns for different customer groups. We divided these representative load patterns into the five stages described in Fig. 4 and calculated the consumption intensity index for each stage using the following formula: (15) Intensity index ( M i j ) = ∑ t ∈ M 1 , M o r n i n g x t ∑ t ∈ M 1 d a y x t ⋯ ∑ t ∈ M 1 , P o s t − p e a k x t ∑ t ∈ M 1 d a y x t ⋮ ⋱ ⋮ ∑ t ∈ M i , M o r n i n g x t ∑ t ∈ M i d a y x t ⋯ ∑ t ∈ M i , P o s t − p e a k x t ∑ t ∈ M i d a y x t where x t represents hourly consumption, while M i j represents the consumption during a specific time period of each stage. For example, M i 2 = 10 , \u2026 , 15 represents the consumption during the C o n t i n u o u s stage, which is from 10 to 15 h. We calculated the intensity index for weekdays and weekends, resulting in two metrics shown in Fig. 9. These intensity metrics will be used in the proposed decision framework presented in the next section to make decisions about DSM and NM programs. 3.5 MCDM evaluation In this section, we will describe how to use multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) to make decisions about DSM and NM programs. The decision matrix, M , will be weighted using various methods, including standard deviation, entropy, angle, Gini, and criteria importance through inter-criteria (CRITIC), as the weighting matrix w j . The matrix will also be normalized using various methods, including max, vector, min\u2013max, and enhanced, as the normalized matrix m ¯ i j . These methods are summarized in Table 1. It is important to note that all criteria are considered homogeneous, meaning that higher values are preferred. Therefore, the normalization equation is designed to maximize the target. Having obtained the normalized and weighted matrices m ¯ i j and w j , we proceed to perform the combined ranking. As discussed in Section 2.3, the Technique for Order of Preference by the TOPSIS method can be used to calculate the distance to the positive ideal solution using Eq. (16). The resulting distances are also the rankings because there is only a positive solution. Additionally, the VIKOR method is applied to calculate the rankings using Eqs. (17) and (18), and the rankings are measured in ascending order using Eq. (19). (16) D i + = ∑ j = 1 J max w j M ¯ j − M ¯ i j 2 (17) S i = ∑ j = 1 J w j max M ¯ j − m ¯ i j max M ¯ j − min M j (18) R i = max w j max M ¯ j − m ¯ i j max M ¯ j − min M j (19) Q i = v S i − min S max S − min ( S ) + ( 1 − v ) R i − min R max R − min ( R ) In Eq. (19), the parameter v is in the interval [0,1] and represents a strategy for maximizing group utility. Since the criteria in our study are considered homogeneous, we aim to balance between maximizing group utility and minimizing individual regret, with a value of v = 0 . 5 representing a risk-neutral group [49]. 3.6 Ensemble fuzzy calculation We use a Cauchy fuzzy ensemble learning framework, which is borrowed from machine learning, to generate a stronger ranking by combining a relatively weak set of rankings from the results of the MCDM methods. The Cauchy fuzzy membership function distribution is defined as follows: (20) fuzzy ( i ) = 1 − 1 1 + a ( i − b ) 2 where a and b are the adjustable parameters. Here, all the MCDM rankings have been summarized to the final ranking via the Cauchy fuzzy transition. The final ensemble ranking is calculated by (21) R ¯ ( i ) = r a n k ∑ j = 1 J f u z z y s i j , ∑ i = 1 I ∑ j = 1 J f u z z y s i j where r a n k ( X , Y ) means the ranking of X \u2019 in the set Y , and s i j stands for the i th alternative and the j th ranking. Algorithm 3 outlines the proposed fuzzy ensemble framework for decision-making for DSM and NM programs. The algorithm takes as input the intensity matrix M , obtained through clustering. First, the matrix M is weighted using various methods including Entropy, Standard Deviation, Angle, Gini, and CRITIC to produce the normalized matrix w j . Next, the matrix M is normalized using the MinMax, Max, Vector, and Enhanced methods to produce the matrix m ¯ i j . The combined ranking is then determined as R ( m ) . Finally, the Cauchy fuzzy ensemble ranking rules are applied to produce the final ranking using a unique fuzzy membership. 4 Case study In order to evaluate the proposed DSM and ND decision framework, we will conduct case studies using the open dataset from Pecan Street [42]. After cleaning and preprocessing, we have selected 708 households with complete electricity consumption data at hourly intervals for a period of two years (March 1, 2015\u2013February 28, 2017). In the following sections, we will use fuzzy c-means clustering to identify representative load patterns and apply the fuzzy ensemble framework to rank customer groups for DSM and NM programs. Finally, we will conduct a sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of our proposed framework. 4.1 Representative load pattern identification by clustering It is important to determine the number of groups, K , for the clustering analysis. We can determine the optimal value of K by calculating the Silhouette Coefficient (SC) for different numbers of clusters using the formula shown in Eqs. (11)\u2013(14). The results of the clustering analysis for weekdays and weekends are shown in Fig. 5. As illustrated in Fig. 5(a), the FCM clustering method produces the best results with seven clusters for the weekdays, as indicated by the highest value of SC. While the performance of three clusters is also good, we choose to use seven clusters in this study due to its higher interpretability. Similarly, based on the results shown in Fig. 5(b) for the weekends, the optimal number of K is six. Therefore, we will use C1\u2013C7 to represent the clustering results for weekdays and G1\u2013G6 for weekends in the following sections. Figs. 6 and 7 show the clustered load profiles for weekdays and weekends, respectively. The solid red line represents the centroid of each cluster, while the blue background lines indicate the dynamics of the total daily load profiles X ˆ w for the customers in that cluster. It can be observed that all six load profiles on weekends have evening peaks, while not all seven load profiles on weekdays do. The main difference between the weekday and weekend load patterns is the shape of the load, particularly the fluctuation. In Fig. 6, we can see that the load patterns for the weekdays are diverse. For example, in cluster C 1 , there is a sharp increase in consumption at the Morning stage and a small decrease at 10 h. The consumption then increases again during the Pre-peak stage and reaches its peak during the Peak stage. In cluster C 2 , consumption increases from 6 to 18 h and then decreases, meaning that the maximum consumption in this cluster is not within the Peak stage. This is different from the basic model shown in Fig. 4. In cluster C 3 , the load pattern is relatively flat and smooth throughout the day, with a peak in consumption at the Peak stage. For cluster C 4 , consumption increases from the Morning stage and remains stable during the Continuous stage, but increases again at the Pre-peak stage, reaching a peak at 18 h and continuing until 21 h. The load pattern for cluster C 5 peaks at 18 h and 19 h. Clusters C 2 and C 6 show similarities, with consumption increasing at the Morning stage. However, in cluster C 6 , consumption remains highest during the Peak stage, while in cluster C 2 it does not. In cluster C 7 , consumption increases rapidly from 6 to 9 h, but increases steadily from 10 to 14 h, then decreases significantly between 14 and 15 h. After that, it increases rapidly and peaks between 18 and 19 h. In Fig. 7, we can see that the load patterns for the weekends are also diverse. For example, in cluster G 1 , consumption increases from 6 to 18 h and reaches a peak at 21 h, which is significantly higher than the Post-peak stage. In cluster G 2 , there is a small peak at the Morning stage, followed by low consumption during the Continuous stage. Consumption then increases rapidly from 15 h and peaks at 21 h. Cluster G 3 shows a moderate increase in consumption at the Morning stage and Continuous stage, while increasing relatively quickly from 15 to 18 h and then beginning to decrease. Cluster G 4 is similar to G 3 , but there is a slight difference at the Continuous stage, where G 4 has a higher consumption than G 3 , and remains at its peak for more than 3 h (from 18 to 20 h). In cluster G 5 , there is a small peak at the Morning stage, similar to G 2 , but consumption is relatively higher during the Continuous stage. This may be why customers in G 5 are more likely to use electrical equipment than those in G 2 . Finally, in cluster G 6 , consumption rapidly increases from 5 to 9 h, remains constant through successive Continuous stage, but then slowly increases to a peak at 20 h before declining. Fig. 8 shows the proportion of daily profiles for all customers in each cluster. In Fig. 8(a), clusters C 4 and C 5 are the most representative weekday load profiles, accounting for more than 50%. This suggests that customers often leave their homes in the morning, but leave most of their electrical equipment on during the day. They return home in the evening, resulting in a consumption peak until bedtime. The main difference between C 4 and C 5 is the fluctuation of the Continuous stage. The three less common patterns, C 1 , C 2 , and C 3 , account for less than 20% of the weekday load patterns. Clusters C 1 , C 2 , C 3 , and C 6 have irregular consumption during the daytime on weekdays. For example, C 1 \u2019s load decreases significantly between 9 and 10 h, while C 2 and C 6 maintain a stable load from 6 to 18 h, without constant consumption in the Continuous stage. C 3 has a relatively flat consumption pattern throughout the day. In Fig. 8(b), the proportion of weekend load patterns is shown, where clusters G 1 , G 2 , and G 4 are the most representative, accounting for 70%. This suggests irregular occupancy during the day on weekends. 4.2 Intensity matrix The consumption intensity matrices for weekdays and weekends were calculated using formula (15) and are shown in Fig. 9. These matrices will also be used as input for the MCDM decision making process. As shown in Fig. 9(a), we can see that during weekdays there is significant intensity in the seven clusters during the five stages. For example, when comparing clusters C 3 and C 5 , we see that C 3 has a stable consumption pattern throughout the weekdays, indicating that these customers do not have high electricity consumption at any particular time. In contrast, C 5 , which has the highest proportion in our dataset, has a distinct high intensity at the Peak stage and moderate intensity during theMorning, Continuous, and Post-peak stages. Additionally, we see that although clusters C 4 and C 5 are the majority of customers among all the clusters, they have significantly different consumption patterns, with C 5 having similar intensity during the Continuous and Post-peak stages while C 4 exhibits different intensity during these stages. In Fig. 9(b), we can see that during weekends, there are no significant variations among the six clusters. For example, while cluster G 4 has the highest intensity of 0.4313 at the Peak stage, clusters G 2 , G 5 , and G 6 do not exhibit much difference at this stage, making it difficult to identify potential customers. Additionally, the Sihouette score for weekends, shown in Fig. 5, is lower than that of weekdays, indicating that the weekday clustering results may be more useful for identifying customers for DSM or NM programs. As such, the decision analysis in the following subsection will use the intensity matrix of weekdays shown in Fig. 9(a) as input. 4.3 MCDM results Table 2 presents the results of five weighting methods (Standard deviation, Entropy, CRITIC, Angle and Gini) on the five criteria (Morning, Continuous, Pre-peak, Peak and Post-peak) (see the weighting method definition in Table 1). In terms of the methods, the values across different criteria are relatively balancing, except for the Entropy method which has a high variability. In terms of criteria, M o r n i n g has high variability across different methods, among of which the Standard deviation method has a value of 0.0378, much lower than others. In addition, for the criteria, C o n t i n u o u s and Post-peak, the Entropy method has the values of 0.3920 and 0.3985, respectively, while the values of the rest methods are much lower. Overall, for each of the weighting method, the results for the five criteria are quite different, which drives to establish a ranking system for final DSM and NM recommendation. We use the evaluation system described in Section 3.5 to conduct MCDM ranking experiments using 40 combinations of 5 weighting methods, 4 normalization methods, and 2 evaluation methods. The results of the TOPSIS method are shown in Fig. 10 and the results of the VIKOR method are shown in Fig. 11. In Fig. 10, we see that the alternatives C 3 and C 5 are consistently ranked sixth and seventh, respectively. However, the ranking of the other alternatives varies significantly depending on the normalization and evaluation method used. For example, when the Vector-Gini combination is applied to alternative C 4 , it is ranked first by the TOPSIS method, while in most other combinations it is ranked fifth. In contrast, the results of the VIKOR method, shown in Fig. 11, do not change significantly and have a relatively stable ranking, with each alternative having a relatively fixed ranking in 20 of the combinations. In particular, C 3 is ranked sixth, the same as in the TOPSIS results. While both methods have their own advantages, these results suggest the potential benefits of using an ensemble framework for fuzzy ranking. 4.4 Ensemble results and sensitive analysis The initial membership function of the fuzzy Cauchy distribution is set based on the assumption that decision makers have a stronger preference for top-ranking alternatives. To evaluate the performance of the final ranking under this assumption, we vary the fuzzy membership of the top-ranked alternative while keeping the fuzzy membership of the last-ranked alternative at 0.1. Specifically, we set the fuzzy membership of the first-ranked alternative to a range of values from 0.6 to 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 0.99, and 0.999. Using these values, we derived the parameters a and b in formula (20) as a = 1 − f ( 1 ) − 9 f ( 1 ) 2 36 ∗ 9 ∗ 1 − f ( 1 ) , b = 1 − 6 9 f ( 1 ) 1 − f ( 1 ) − 9 f ( 1 ) . The final rankings are listed in Table 3. The results show good performance and consistency using the proposed ensemble framework, with only alternatives C 1 and C 4 alternating between the 4th and 5th rank when the fuzzy membership is 0.99 and 0.999. In terms of sensitivity analysis, Fig. 12 shows the fuzzy dynamic results for the first ranking with six different fuzzy memberships. When the membership of the highest-ranked alternative is set to 0.999 and 0.99, the rankings of the 1st to 5th alternatives do not change significantly, while the 6th ranking experiences a relative decrease. On the other hand, there is a clear downward gradient in the ranking from 1st to 7th when the membership of the highest-ranked alternative is set to 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9. This suggests that the best ranking for the DSM and NM programs in this case study is \u201c C 5 \u201d, \u201c C 2 \u201d, \u201c C 7 \u201d, \u201c C 1 \u201d, \u201c C 4 \u201d, \u201c C 3 \u201d. It should be noted that C 3 is consistently ranked last in both TOPSIS and VIKOR, indicating that households in C 3 are the most stable and do not experience significant fluctuations in their daily electricity consumption. The ranking of C 3 is consistent with the results of the previous clusters shown in Fig. 6, which confirms the validity of the proposed decision framework. 5 Conclusions and future work Utilities have long recognized the importance of providing personalized service to their customers, and DSM and NM programs are key tools in this regard. In this paper, we proposed a decision framework to recommend DSM and NM programs to customers. We first cleaned the data and used the isolation tree method to detect outliers, then applied the fuzzy c-Means clustering algorithm to identify representative load patterns. We proposed a five-step method to partition the daily load profile based on consumption intensity and calculated consumption intensity matrices based on the identified load patterns. We implemented a decision support framework based on a fuzzy ensemble MCDM approach to identify potential customers for DSM and NM programs with the given consumption matrices. We conducted a case study to comprehensively evaluate the proposed decision framework, and the results have shown the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. The proposed decision framework has significant practical and research value. By utilizing smart meter data and applying clustering analysis and a fuzzy ensemble based multi-criteria decision making framework, utilities can more effectively target and design DSM and NM programs for different customer groups, leading to increased energy savings and renewable energy integration. This framework can also help utilities better understand and respond to diverse consumption behaviors, and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of energy demand management efforts. In terms of concrete examples of application, the proposed framework can be used by utilities to identify and target residential customers who are most likely to benefit from DSM and NM programs, such as those with high energy consumption during peak periods or those with high potential for renewable energy generation. By quantifying the economic benefit and impact of these programs, utilities can more accurately assess the potential return on investment and better allocate resources. There are several directions for future work that can build on and extend the contributions of this paper. First, we will investigate the inclusion of additional decision variables, such as household socioeconomic factors, in the framework. Second, we will explore the use of other technical alternatives for DSM and NM recommendations, such as deep learning and recommendation system technologies. Third, we will test and refine the framework with additional real-world data, and explore its potential applications in other sectors such as commercial and industrial customers.

        "dc:description": "Demand side management (DSM) and net metering (NM) are two important strategies that can be used in smart energy management systems to help utilities reduce peak loads and increase the penetration of renewable energy, while also enabling customers to save energy and reduce energy bills. In order to effectively implement DSM and NM programs, it is important to identify the customers who are most likely to benefit from these programs and to quantify the economic impact and benefit for both utilities and end-users. This paper proposes a decision framework that utilizes smart meter data and clustering analysis to identify representative load patterns, and a five-stage method for segmenting load patterns to create a consumption intensity matrix. A fuzzy ensemble based multi-criteria decision making framework is then applied to identify the most potential customer groups and quantify the economic benefit and impact. This paper presents a novel approach for identifying potential customers for DSM and NM programs and developing personalized services for energy demand management. The proposed framework is evaluated through a case study, which demonstrates its robustness in decision making and identifies 13 typical load patterns, seven for weekdays and six for weekends, representing diverse consumption behaviors. The weekday load patterns perform better than the weekend load patterns in terms of the five-stage method.",
