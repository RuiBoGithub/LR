Existing non-residential buildings account for a significant proportion of the energy consumption of the European building stock. Modernizing these buildings can significantly contribute to declared emission reduction targets. Modernization measures are rarely realized in the life cycle of buildings but have long-term effects on their energetic performance. Therefore, it is not only essential to identify future-oriented modernization measures but also to schedule them over the life cycle of a building. For this purpose, we present a mixed-integer linear program that schedules measures for a building energy system including envelope and supply system. The program determines not only the optimal combination of modernization measures but also the respective optimal point of time when each measure shall be realized. A multi-objective optimization is conducted to minimize carbon emissions and net present value. Thermal demand profiles serve as input for the optimization model and are calculated preliminary using dynamic simulations. Constraints and boundary conditions are specified separately for each prospective year of the schedule's time horizon. Results showed that the constitution of a building energy system changes several times throughout a schedule. Determined Pareto-efficient solutions reveal that carbon emissions could be saved more cost-efficiently than with approaches without scheduling. Keywords Building energy system Modernization schedule Mixed-integer linear programming Multi-objective Optimization 1 Introduction Buildings are responsible for approximately 36% of the emissions emitted in the European Union [1]. Since 35% of these buildings are older than 50 years and 75% are classified as energy inefficient [2], there seems to be an enormous saving potential. This potential can be, for example, exploited by increasing the current renovation rate from about 1% to 3% and develop long-term renovation strategies [1]. Non-residential buildings (NRB) are inferior to residential buildings in terms of numbers, but their specific energy consumption is estimated at least 40% higher than the equivalent value for the residential sector [2]. In existing buildings, a central target is the building energy system's (BES) modernization whereby carbon emissions can be saved through efficiency measures and the integration of renewable energies (RE). In order to scale these measures to entire building stocks, cost-effectiveness should be considered additionally. The lifetime of technical systems in buildings averages between 15 and 25 years and that of the building shell between 40 and 60 years [3]. Yet, all these components and systems are often being used longer. This means, modernization measures are rarely implemented during the life cycle of a building and highly influence its energetic performance for many years. To minimize carbon emissions cost-efficiently, all measures on a building energy system should be synchronized. Furthermore, these measures strongly depend on predominant boundary conditions (e.g. energy prices). These boundary conditions could be concerned in an optimal chronological sequence of all measures. By mathematically representing these influences, optimization approaches can support engineers during the early design stage of planning modernization measures. Therefore, this paper presents the development of a new approach to determine multi-cycle modernization schedules by the use of a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). This approach is based on previous research [4] and is now further developed by the integration of dynamic thermal demand simulations. The proposed method globally optimizes the modernization of an existing building energy system whereby dependencies between all modernization measures of the entire life cycle are taken into account. Measures involve changes to the energy supply system as well as to insulation measures of the building's envelope. Boundary conditions differ for each prospective year inside the MILP to generate realistic modernization schedules. We applied the developed method on a typical non-residential building, as this enables us to later on scale the method on whole building stocks of non-residential buildings. 2 Literature review In practice, architects, building planners and energy consultants mostly analyze a building by executing building inspections. Afterwards a list of possible measures is drawn up, evaluation criteria are defined, and the measures are assessed. Consequently, the quality of the resulting modernization and efficiency measures are strongly dependent on the competence of the planners, the conditions during the inspections and subjectively defined criteria. Furthermore, a modernization schedule, i.e., a chronological sequence of the measures designed by these methods does not respect dependencies between measures at different points in time. These drawbacks can be overcome by optimization methods where all solutions are considered and evaluated using the same priorities [5]. These methods offer a generic and objective alternative for the systematic identification of modernization measures. 2.1 Optimization of building energy systems Along with an increasing political and social drive to improve the ecological performance of existing buildings under economic constraints, research efforts to find optimal retrofit strategies have increased. Evins [6] has summarized research on BES optimization and stated that 40% of the published papers focus only on Energy Saving Methods (ESM) that modify the building envelope. Only few papers have investigated a combinatorial approach considering additionally the Energy Supply System (ESS) [6]. The modernization of buildings as a compromise between ecological goals and economic possibilities is the reason for an increasing number of publications using multi-criteria optimization - even though 50% of the papers analyzed by Evins consider only one objective function [6]. The most common practices for optimizing BES design are meta-heuristics and linear programming. These two practices have been used by most of the research presented in the following. 2.1.1 Residential buildings In the residential sector, research mainly has focused on economic performance by evaluating life cycle costs, usually represented by the net present value (NPV) or annualized costs. As a second common objective function, the ecological performance by e.g. evaluating emitted emissions has been considered. Models determining the optimal design of envelope and HVAC-system evaluated with life cycle costs have been shown by Palonen et al. who used a genetic algorithm [7] and Ihm et al. [8] who applied linear programming to residential buildings with a constrained maximum energy usage. In their recent work, Schütz et al. [9] identified the optimal combination of ESM for the envelope and configurations for the ESS in residential buildings. They used a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) and reduced the problem size with the use of typical days while annualized costs and emitted emissions serve as objective functions [9]. A genetic algorithm was instead used by Penna et al. who aim to transform residential buildings to nearly-zero energy and extend the economic and ecological evaluation by using thermal comfort as third objective function [10]. Galimshina et al. [11] proposed a life-cycle assessment model for typical Swiss residential buildings and used a genetic algorithm to find optimal renovation measures. The uncertainty of different model parameters was included and they found the heating system to be the most important part for renovation and that its replacement can save more emissions than a solely envelope renovation does [11]. An approach of optimizing the whole residential building stock of Germany using a genetic algorithm has been shown by Streblow et al. [12]. They used emissions avoidance costs and primary energy as objectives and applied their method on typical residential buildings for the scalation on the building stock [12]. In practice commonly used static approaches for the building's demand calculation lead to high differences between the calculated demand and the real consumption [13]. Furthermore, these approaches can hardly be used for the design of fluctuating renewable energy plants. Dynamic simulations with high temporal resolution may overcome this drawback. A therefore promising and occasionally employed approach is the combination of dynamic thermal demand simulations and optimization models, whereby the simulations are performed preliminary. It combines the described advantages of dynamic demand calculations with the objective decision-making of optimization models. Recently, Iturriaga et al. [14] have applied linear programming coupled with a TRNSYS simulation for the BES of a multi-family house to minimize annual costs under constrained primary energy usage. A degree-day approach to simplify load curves was used to reduce computation efforts [14]. 2.1.2 Non-residential buildings Kerdan et al. [15] have used a similar dynamic approach including an EnergyPlus simulation and a genetic algorithm. They introduced exergy as an objective function and applied their approach on two typical UK non-residential buildings [15]. Research on the modernization of existing NRB commonly focuses on specific cases or building classes due to the complexity and variety of this sector. Ascione et al. [16] also used a two-stage optimization combining EnergyPlus and MATLAB to assess retrofitting of an existing hospital. They first designed possible measures by means of simulations in EnergyPlus combined with Latin Hypercube sampling and a sensitivity analysis, then a genetic algorithm was used in two stages to design and select the measures [16]. Some research has included analysis of sensitivity against parameter changes over time. Hillebrand et al. developed a retrofit matrix for office buildings to analyze different combinations of ESM and ESS by including an uncertainty analysis of energy prices in their work [17]. Shen et al. used a genetic algorithm coupled with a simulation that was based on metered energy whose sensitivity against changing climate conditions was investigated [18]. A more practical approach was investigated by Shao et al. [19] who assessed ESM and ESS of an office building by including analyses of the design team into their optimization model and thus directly supported the planners in the early design stage. Both, objective functions and possible renovation measures were defined by the planners and a genetic algorithm selected the optimal combination of measures [19]. Hong et al. deployed a practical tool for energy retrofitting which advises potential retrofits and allows benchmarking to similar commercial buildings [20]. A mixed-integer non-linear programming framework was developed by Javid et al. [21]. It determines the optimal energy system for existing buildings by minimizing the life-cycle global warming potential and total annual costs and has been applied to two educational buildings [21]. 2.2 Modernization schedules In terms of prioritizing measures, in practice these are usually sorted by economic parameters (e.g. payback time) and realized regarding this sorting. A more ecological approach is the sorting by emission avoidance costs. In both cases, the optimal date to realize the measures is missing as well as a systematic scheduling over the whole life cycle and considering dependencies between measures in different years. In research this topic has been rarely examined so far. Mans et al. used a genetic algorithm to define retrofit orders of a research campus, concerned the envelopes of the buildings, and investigated the influence on the used central energy supply units of a district heating grid [22]. Spinnraeker et al. also focused on retrofit orders for the envelopes of a campus and minimized life cycle costs by using a genetic algorithm [23]. For large-scale portfolios of different commercial buildings, Wu et al. [24] determined at which date a new technology is best implemented to a specific building type in order to perform in energy savings and NPV. They regarded building modernization as a control system where retrofitting decisions are treated as system input, the number of items for each retrofitted facility as the system state, and energy savings and cash flows as the system output [24]. In a previous work, Richarz et al. [25] used a weighted sum model for the retrofit order of a portfolio of commercial buildings taking into account envelope, supply, and ventilation system. They calculated measures for all buildings and evaluated their benefits in different criteria for the whole portfolio [25]. But like the other mentioned authors they have prioritized the modernization of a building inside a portfolio and do not schedule measures inside a single building. Others have dealt with optimal maintenance planning. In this context, Farahani et al. with a condition-deterioration model [26] for the envelope of a residential building and Wang et al. [27] with a multi-objective optimization approach for a NRB are to be mentioned. Ref. [27] used a weighted sum of objective functions and solved their problem with a differential evolution algorithm. Both have emphasized the resulting economic saving effects and the importance of scheduling maintenance to avoid failures in building components. An economic thesis was presented by Cypra [28] who calculated the optimal period of use and date of replacement for plants in residential buildings by evaluating the NPV under the influence of energy efficiency certificates. Therefore, a linear optimization problem was formulated that contains constraints based on scenarios for state subsidies [28]. Since we aim on scheduling modernization measures over time, multiple years need to be considered. Recent works [29\u201331] have demonstrated the benefits and feasibility of multi-year approaches in optimization models. For the economic planning of a microgrid, Pecenak et al. [29] compared two multi-year approaches in a single-objective optimization model and found both to be an economic improvement for the grid, compared with a single-year approach. Bohlayer et al. [30] compared different multi-year models for optimizing multi-energy systems and found that the consideration of different investment periods strongly influences the energy systems\u2019 performance. Mavromatidis et al. [31] presented a MILP framework for distributed energy systems and their case studies reveal that the interconnection between investments in different years leads to better economic and environmental performance. 2.3 Contribution From our work done so far, we identified a lack of scheduling modernization measures over the lifetime of typical single non-residential buildings, taking into account envelope as well as ESS, and simultaneously optimizing economic and ecological performance under yearly differing boundary conditions. For this challenge we see a combination of dynamic thermal simulations and mixed-integer linear programming with a multi-year approach promising. Our application contained a typical non-residential building to later on scale our method on building stocks. We also performed a scenario analysis to take uncertain future boundary conditions into account. 3 Proposed method In this work, a mixed-integer linear program is applied to determine modernization schedules for NRB. The hourly demands for space heating, domestic hot water, cooling and electricity are considered by the use of TEASER [32], a widely-used and validated open source tool for the generation of simulation models in Modelica. The MILP is implemented in Python and solved with the Gurobi Optimizer [33]. Our MILP determines modernization measures that include the renovation of the building's envelope (roof, outer walls and windows) to reduce the demand, and ESS which comprises gas and pellet boilers (BOI), geothermal and air source heat pumps (HP), combined heat and power units (CHP), electrical heaters (EH), vapor-compression refrigeration systems (VCRS), photovoltaic modules (PV), and solar thermal collectors (STC). Furthermore, batteries (BAT) and thermal energy storages (TES) are included. The model is designed to calculate modernization schedules from the current year until 2050. A schedule advises both, optimal measures and time of implementation. To determine optimal timing of the measures it is necessary to examine the existing ESS of the NRB and to incorporate the lifetime of all devices. Since boundary conditions like energy fuel costs, carbon emission factors, and investments for devices change over time, we define these values for each considered year individually. Furthermore, we vary highly influential parameters to evaluate different future scenarios. Fig. 1 gives an overview of our developed and used method whose key aspects will be described in the following. First, the coupling with TEASER [32] is explained. Afterwards the MILP formulation, in particular objective functions, economic, ecological and technical constraints as well as implemented changes of boundary conditions across a schedule are introduced. 3.1 Dynamic thermal demand calculation and renovation measures The calculation of hourly demands is done by dynamic building simulations in Modelica. TEASER [32] is used for the generation of the model as it uses typical building data and therefore is well suited for our intended application of typical NRB. The resulting simulation model is a so called RC-model. This is a simplification approach where the heat-transfer is modeled with electrical resistances (R) and thermal capacities (C), e.g. of the envelope, are represented by electrical capacities. Lauster et al. [34] and Schütz [35] showed that these models are suitable for the dynamic demand calculation with sufficient resolution and low computation effort. With TEASER [32], we use multi-zone 10R2C-models where all zones inside a NRB are represented. For the consideration of the renovation measures on the building's envelope, simulations with different parameters are performed. Here, we consider the three components outer wall, windows and roof of the building and perform simulations with three different specifications for these components. These specifications correspond to the three different insulation standards existing insulation, additional insulation level 1, additional insulation level 2 that are shown in Table 1 for the building of our case study in section 4. By creating a simulation model for every possible combination of components and their insulation standards, and simulating it in Modelica, we obtain 27 load curves. Subsequently, the optimization model can choose between these curves that represent different combinations of measures on the envelope. In the next step, all load curves and the weather data are clustered into twelve typical days to reduce the computation effort of the MILP. Here, a k-medoids clustering is used as it has been found to be the most suitable algorithm for building energy systems [36]. Consequently, a feedback between the courses of the load curves, i.e., the inner temperature and the ESS is not possible. This would increase the calculation effort enormously, since simulation and optimization would have to run in parallel. 3.2 MILP formulation The optimization model evolved from a previous work [4] and contains a novel approach of scheduling optimal modernization measures for the energy supply system and the envelope over the lifetime of a NRB. By means of a Pareto optimization, a problem with multiple objectives can be solved. Within our analysis, the objectives are the net present value and the carbon emissions of a building to be modernized. Since the focus is on the modernization of existing buildings, the existing ESS of a building is included. The objective functions and main constraints of the model are presented in the following. Decision variables are written in bold. 3.2.1 Objective functions There are two objective functions determining optimal modernization schedules. The first objective is the net present value (NPV) of the modernization schedule. According to German standard VDI 2067 [3] the NPV is the sum of discounted yearly costs for investments C inv , operation and maintenance (o&m) C o&m , and demand related costs C dem . (1) m i n N P V = C inv + C o&m + C dem As saving greenhouse gas emissions is the main goal when modernizing buildings, annualized carbon emissions (Emi) serve as second objective. These consist of emitted emissions due to the consumption of gas, wood pellets, and electricity. (2) m i n E m i = E m i gas + E m i pellet + E m i el We perform a multi-objective optimization whereby the Pareto frontier is computed using the ϵ-constrained method concerning Mavrotas [37]. Initially, the optimal schedule for both objective functions is calculated separately. By minimizing the NPV, the economic optimum is calculated. For the calculation of the ecological optimum, the model firstly considers Emi as objective to determine the minimum possible emissions Emi min. In a second-step optimization, NPV is minimized with Equation (3) as constraint. Thereby, Emi min serves as a limiting emission maximum. (3) E m i ≤ E m i min In this way, the minimum possible emissions can be reached and additionally only economically sensible decisions are made. In essence, this means that devices are not oversized. Pareto-efficient solutions in between the economic and ecological optimum are calculated by minimizing NPV and gradually reducing the maximum value of permitted carbon emissions. 3.2.2 Economic and ecological constraints Costs for investments are based on the purchase of new devices for the energy supply system and renovation measures of the building's envelope. (4) C inv = C inv,dev + C inv,env Investments for ESS are possible in every considered year i. They consist of a fixed part c d e v inst for the installation and a yearly differing power-specific part c dev,i . If a device is installed, the binary decision variable X dev,i indicating if in a year i the device dev has been purchased, would equal 1. p dev,i is the decision about the continuous nominal power of a device. All positions are discounted to the year i in which they occur, with r representing the interest rate and n the total years of the schedule. (5) C inv,dev = ∑ i = 1 n 1 ( 1 + r ) i ( ∑ d e v ( p d e v , i ⋅ c d e v , i + X d e v , i ⋅ c d e v inst ) ⋅ 1 l d e v ≤ n − i ( 1 − p r d e v rv ( 1 + r ) n − i ) ) l d e v ≥ n − i Furthermore, the NPV of an investment is reduced by p r d e v rv ( 1 + r ) n − i if the lifetime l dev of an ESS device exceeds the remaining time horizon. Thereby, the residual value (rv) of a device at the end of the time horizon is considered and subtracted. We therefore calculate the proportion p r d e v rv of the lifetime that remains after the considered time horizon via Equation (6). Hereby, we assume the residual value to be linearly dependent on the device's remaining lifetime. The lifetime of devices is given by German standard VDI 2067 [3]. (6) p r d e v rv = l d e v − ( n − i ) l d e v Devices of the ESS with remaining lifetime that initially exist in the building at the beginning of the considered time horizon can be hold in the building. These have lower efficiency than novel devices. Equations (7)\u2013(9) assure that devices can only supply the building if they were bought. Furthermore, it allows the active power Q ̇ d e v , i , d , t heat∕cool ( P d e v , i , d , t el ) to equal the sum of the power investment decisions for a device or be smaller than it in every hour t of typical day d. The sum of the power investment decisions with index i ̃ equals the nominal power of a device. Thereby, the device's supply is constrained by its lifetime and can also stay unused ( Q ̇ d e v , i , d , t = 0 ) in any year before. (7) Q ̇ d e v , i , d , t heat ≤ ∑ i ̃ = max ( 0 , i + 1 − l d e v ) i + 1 p d e v , i ̃ ∀ d e v ∈ B O I , C H P , E H , H P air , H P geo , S T C , T E S , i , d , t (8) Q ̇ d e v , i , d , t cool ≤ ∑ i ̃ = max ( 0 , i + 1 − l d e v ) i + 1 p d e v , i ̃ ∀ d e v ∈ { H P air , H P geo , V C R S } , i , d , t (9) P d e v , i , d , t el ≤ ∑ i ̃ = max ( 0 , i + 1 − l d e v ) i + 1 p d e v , i ̃ ∀ d e v ∈ { B A T , C H P , P V } , i , d , t Possible insulation standards env of the envelope are considered by including the load curves determined by the simulation models (section 3.1). Hereby, the boolean decision variable X env,i specifies which load profile is chosen each year. Consequently, only one of the 27 X env,i can be chosen in each year of the modernization schedule. (10) ∑ e n v = 1 27 X e n v , i = 1 ∀ i Before the start of a schedule the building is not renovated at all. If X env,i changes from one year to the next, the insulation standard of the envelope changes. This means one or more components of the envelope are insulated. Regarding investments for these insulation measures are respected in the price matrix c o l d E n v , n e w E n v inv that bases on price-functions from Ref. [38]. To decide which of these prices occur in each year, another binary variable X oldEnv, newEnv,i is needed. It is a set of decisions for all possible changes from one load profile, i.e., insulation standard to another. Hence, only one X oldEnv, newEnv,i equals 1 for a specific transition of load profiles in each year. (11) C inv,env = ∑ i = 1 n 1 ( 1 + r ) i ∑ n e w E n v ∑ o l d E n v X o l d E n v , n e w E n v , i ⋅ c o l d E n v , n e w E n v inv (12) ∑ n e w E n v ∑ o l d E n v X o l d E n v , n e w E n v , i = 1 ∀ i To ensure X oldEnv, newEnv,i represents the change of X env,i−1 to X env,i , we implemented the following equation. (13) X o l d E n v , n e w E n v , i ≥ X e n v , i − 1 + X e n v , i − 1 ∀ o l d E n v , n e w E n v ∈ e n v , i Demand-related costs for energy sources and earnings for exported electricity are determined by the use of continuous decision variables e i , d , t gas∕pellet∕el for the used energy in hour t of typical day d, yearly differing energy prices c i gas/pellet/el , proceeds s i sale, el for self-generated electricity, and the weighting factor w d for a typical day. As each typical day represents a number of w d days of the original input data set, the demands of the energy sources are weighted appropriately. (14) C dem = ∑ i = 1 n 1 ( 1 + r ) i ∑ d = 1 12 w d ∑ t = 1 24 ( e i , d , t gas ⋅ c i gas + e i , d , t pellet ⋅ c i pellet + e i , d , t el ⋅ c i el − e i , d , t sale,el ⋅ s i sale, el ) Costs for o&m occur during the lifetime of a device. According to German standard VDI 2067 [3] these costs are dependent on the initial investment of a device and a device-specific parameter c d e v o&m . Here, we also include potential existing devices that are installed in the building at the start of the modernization schedule. Binary variables X ex. dev,i decide whether an existing device is used in a year. Since no costs for the investments occur for existing devices, costs for o&m are directly determined by assumed costs C e x . d e v o&m that are based on the power of the existing devices. (15) C o&m = ∑ i = 1 n 1 ( 1 + r ) i ∑ d e v ∑ i ̃ = max ( 0 , i + 1 − l d e v ) i + 1 ( p d e v , i ̃ ⋅ c d e v , i ̃ + X d e v , i ̃ ⋅ c d e v inst ) ⋅ c d e v o&m + ∑ e x . d e v X e x . d e v , i ⋅ C e x . d e v o&m With our proposed calculation, the combination of ESS devices is not restricted and we allow investments at every year to define the schedule. While similar models in literature (e.g. Refs. [12,14]), allow mainly initial investments and static cash flows, our approach considers investments in the ESS and the building's envelope at any year and dynamic cash flows to determine a chronological sequence of all modernization measures over the lifetime of a building. Carbon emissions derive by the product of e i , d , t gas∕pellet∕el and emission factors f gas, f pellet, f i el . Emission factors for pellets and gas are taken from Ref. [39]. So far we do not consider renewable gas. (16) E m i = ∑ i = 1 n ∑ d = 1 12 w d ∑ t = 1 24 ( e i , d , t gas ⋅ f gas + e i , d , t pellet ⋅ f pellet + e i , d , t el ⋅ f i el ) The factor for electricity is derived from Ref. [40] and is subject to yearly changes due to the further increasing amount of RE in Europe's electricity grids. The handling of these and further changing boundary conditions are described within the next subsection. 3.2.3 Changes of the boundary conditions across a schedule Prices for energy fuels and technologies as well as the carbon emission intensity of public electricity are subject to temporal changes in the course of the years. By generating a modernization schedule, it is therefore necessary to contemplate these changes when calculating the economic and ecological performance. Projections for the gas price c i gas , the carbon intensity of the public electricity grid f i el and electricity prices c i el until 2050 can be found in the EU reference scenario [40]. It is used in this model to vary parameters for each year of the schedules (Table B.10). A yearly forecast for the investment costs c dev,i of ESS devices is extracted from Ref. [41] and the price c i pellet for pellets is assumed to rise similar to the gas price. Proceeds s i sale, el for electricity feed-in to the grid are forecasted by extrapolating quarterly data from the EEX market into the future [42]. 3.2.4 Technical constraints ESS\u2019 devices dev, including heat, cold and power generators as well as energy supply via storages, have to cover the simulated dynamic heat Q ̇ i , d , t dem,heat , drinking hot water Q ̇ i , d , t dem,dhw , cold Q ̇ i , d , t dem,cold , and electricity P i , d , t dem,el demand of the NRB (see also Equation A.5) as well as charging of TES and BAT and the sale of self-generated electricity at each hourly time step t at every typical day d in every year i. (17) ∑ d e v Q ̇ d e v , i , d , t heat = Q ̇ i , d , t dem,heat + Q ̇ i , d , t dem,dhw + Q ̇ i , d , t TES,ch ∀ i , d , t (18) ∑ d e v Q ̇ d e v , i , d , t cool = Q ̇ i , d , t dem,cold ∀ i , d , t (19) P i , d , t el,grid + ∑ d e v P d e v , i , d , t el = P i , d , t dem,el + P i , d , t BAT,ch + P i , d , t sale,el ∀ i , d , t The hourly power of all devices are continuous decision variables that need to be smaller than their corresponding nominal power. Due to German standard DIN V 18599 [43], drinking hot water needs to be heated above 57.5 °C for health reasons. Only BOI, CHP, and EH may provide water of this temperature. Hereby, we take into account that low temperature heaters may preheat from cold water temperature T cw (10 °C [43]) on flow temperature T fl . (20) ∑ d e v Q ̇ d e v , i , d , t heat ≥ Q ̇ i , d , t dhw ⋅ T dhw − T fl T dhw − T cw ∀ d e v ∈ { B O I , C H P , E H } , i , d , t Efficiencies of PV, CHP and EH are set to constant values. Those of HP, VCRS and STC are implemented according to German standard DIN V 18599 [43]. The efficiency (COP, EER) of geothermal HP (HP geo) depends on the building's flow temperature while that of air HP (HP air) additionally depends on ambient temperature (Table B.9). All types of HP can be used for cooling and heating while VCRS only for cooling. Geothermal HP includes passive cooling with increased COP and lower nominal cooling power than active cooling. So far, part-load behavior of plants is not included. (21) P d e v , i , d , t dem = Q ̇ d e v , i , d , t heat C O P d e v , i , d , t heat + Q ̇ d e v , i , d , t cool E E R d e v , i , d , t cool ∀ d e v ∈ { H P geo , H P air , V C R S } , i , d , t Boolean variables Y d e v , i , d cool assure that either heating or cooling mode may be used by HP each day, whereby M is a large number in the dimension of the maximal nominal heating power of HP. Furthermore, we consider a device-specific ratio of cooling to heating power. (22) Q ̇ d e v , i , d heat ≤ ( 1 − Y d e v , i , d cool ) ⋅ M ∀ d e v ∈ { H P geo , H P air } , i , d (23) Q ̇ d e v , i , d cool ≤ Y d e v , i , d cool ⋅ M ∀ d e v ∈ { H P geo , H P air } , i , d The decision if HPgeo runs in active or passive cooling mode is analogously made every 3 h by boolean decision variables Y d e v , i , d , t passive,cool . Active heat power of STC depends on its area A i STC , the solar radiation I i,d,t , and the efficiency η i , d , t STC . The efficiency of STC is calculated with device-specific parameters and the temperature difference between absorber and outside air (Equation A.7) [43]. (24) Q ̇ i , d , t STC ≤ A i STC ⋅ I i , d , t ⋅ η i , d , t STC ∀ i , d , t PV and STC can use the roof area A roof in common. To avoid mutual shadowing of the modules, a minimum distance between them should be fulfilled. Therefore, concerning Ref. [44] only half of the area of flat roofs are fitted with modules. (25) ∑ d e v A d e v , i ≤ 0.5 ⋅ A roof ∀ d e v ∈ { P V , S T C } , i TES and BAT can be purchased to lower peak demands so that the designed power of the other ESS devices can be reduced. Decision variables are the continuous sizes ( V TES,i , Cap TES,i , Cap BAT,i ) and hourly power of charging ch dev,i,d,t and discharging dch dev,i,d,t of the storages. The capacity of the TES is derived as the product of the physical properties of water and the difference between the flow and cold water temperature. (26) C a p i TES = V TES i ⋅ ρ w ⋅ κ w ⋅ ( T fl − T cw ) The state of charge (SOC) at one time step t is dependent on its preceding time step and the difference between charging and discharging power between these time steps. Standby heat losses hl for TES are included. (27) S O C d e v , i , d , t = S O C d e v , i , d , t − 1 + Δ t ⋅ ( c h d e v , i , d , t − d c h d e v , i , d , t ) − h l d e v , i , d , t ∀ d e v ∈ { T E S , B A T } , i , d , t ∈ { 1 , . . , 23 } Furthermore, TES\u2019 volume is limited proportionally to the building size and (dis)charging power of BAT is constrained by a minimum time for total (dis)charge and depth of discharge (Equation A.8). The initial SOC for a day is S O C d e v , i , d start . Therefore, the storage balance for the first time step of a day is as follows. (28) S O C d e v , i , d , 0 = S O C d e v , i , d start + Δ t ( c h d e v , i , d , 0 − d c h d e v , i , d , 0 ) − h l d e v , i , d , 0 ∀ d e v ∈ { T E S , B A T } , i , d We allow different SOC at the beginning and end of a day and assure a correct energy balance by setting the sum of all daily SOC differences over one year to zero. (29) Δ S O C d e v , i = ∑ d w d ( S O C d e v , i , d start − S O C d e v , i , d , 23 ) = 0 ∀ d e v ∈ { T E S , B A T } , i We figured out that an annual resolution of the model requires high computing efforts and the Gurobi optimizer [33] could not find an optimal solution in reasonable time. Analysis concerning a lower resolution revealed that computing efforts could be decreased significantly with the usage of three-year intervals for i. Since the lifetime of ESS devices averages about 15 years and modernization measures in practice will not be realized annually, we use this resolution for our application that is described in the following chapter. For this application an optimal solution was found with a MIPGap of 2%. 4 Application to a typical German office building As a case study, the presented method was applied to a typical existing office building in Germany (Table 2 ). The interest rate r was set to 5% and a time horizon n of 30 years from 2020 to 2050 was considered. Using TEASER's archetype buildings we generated simulation models that are mainly based on data from Ref. [45]. In the following, we present the results of the time series aggregation performed. Thereafter, we describe the optimal combination for the BES that our model calculated from the above-described ESS devices and possible renovation measures of the envelope (Table 1). 4.1 Dynamic thermal demand calculation and data clustering All 27 demand load profiles for the possible envelope insulation standards of the case study building were determined by our simulation models. Fig. 2 and Table 3 exemplary show and compare two of these profiles. Since in Profile 221 all possible envelope components were insulated, its yearly and peak heat demand are lower than that of Profile 001. Simultaneously, the yearly cold demand rises slightly. Due to the inertia of the building mass, the peak cold demand decreases slightly. As a result from time series aggregation, we obtained weather and demand profiles for every representative day. Fig. 3 depicts exemplary values of input data for clustering, referred to as raw data, and the obtained profiles, referred to as clustered data, in form of heat maps. In detail, the ambient temperature, the heat and cold demands of the above described office building with the renovation standard of Profile 001 are shown. We observed that the shape of the profiles is well imitated in terms of daily and seasonal fluctuations. However, peak values seem to be reduced by means of clustering. Inspecting, the evaluation criteria shown in Table 4 this proves true for certain profiles. Electrical demands and domestic hot water demands are not affected by clustering. Peak reductions of about 25% occur for ambient temperature, whereas the mean absolute error (MAE) is 3 °C. The average values for peak reduction in heat demands are in the same range, while peaks for cold demand are reduced by up to 87% on average. Nevertheless, MAE for cold demand is low at 0.6 kW, whereas there is a higher MAE of about 14 kW for heat demand. 4.2 Optimal modernization schedules All generated modernization schedules form a Pareto frontier (Fig. 4 ). The economic optimum is reached at a NPV of 698.4 \u20ac/m2 and the ecological optimal point is at 164.0 kgCO2/m2. Lower emissions are not achievable because of the limited space for solar devices on the roof. We observed that the emission avoidance costs rise disproportionately with the amount of reduced emissions. More than one third of the emissions at the economic optimum can be saved at additional costs of only approximately 4%. Each Pareto-efficient point holds information about one modernization schedule, i.e., the composition of the BES over the next 30 years until 2050, the year the EU expects to have reached its final emission goals. For the marked Pareto-efficient point in Fig. 4, Fig. 5 shows the development of the heating and cooling power of ESS devices as well as insulation measures, the capacity of used storages and the course of emitted emissions per fuel. Each cross symbolizes the installation of a new device. We observe significant changes in the composition of the BES over the considered time horizon. At the beginning, a CHP covers the base load of electricity as well as partly the heat demand. The existing TES flattens the heat demand until its end of lifetime in order to increase the full load hours of the CHP. A smaller new gas boiler and a larger pellet boiler to reduce emissions initially replace the existing gas boiler. Even though investment costs for EH are relatively low, this life-cycle approach reveals that boilers combined with TES show better performance in covering peak loads. For cooling, only a VCRS covers the demand in the beginning. Because of a predicted higher increase of the gas price compared to the electricity price and simultaneously the decreasing carbon emission intensity of the public electricity grid (section 3.2.3 [40]), changes take effect around 2035. From then onward, electricity-based heating is used intensively with the use of a geothermal heat pump. Simultaneously, the two boilers are replaced by smaller ones after their end of lifetime. In 2032, a large roof-based STC is installed that uses the TES as does the CHP. Hence, the TES is slightly enlarged after the existing one reached its end of lifetime. The CHP is only enlarged marginally and continuous to cover the base load. Because of three insulation measures, the heat demand reduces while the cold demand rises slightly. In the second half of the considered time horizon, the cold demand is covered by a smaller VCRS and half by passive and active cooling of the geothermal HP. Concerning the insulation standards of the envelope, the chosen demand profiles for the years 2020\u20132032 and 2035\u20132050 were already mentioned and compared in section 4.1. Analyzing the change of insulation standards, we see that measures are first realized on the roof (2020) and then, combined with the STC installation, on outer walls (2032) and at the windows (2035). Interestingly, these measures are implemented a few years before significant changes in the energy supply system occur. The economic optimum shows slightly different results. For the envelope, insulation measures are done few years later. In terms of heating, it is characterized by the use of larger gas-based technologies, smaller STC and no pellet boiler. During the calculation procedure of the Pareto frontier (subsection 3.1), two ecological optimal points are calculated and shown in Fig. 4. In the point which is only called ecological optimum, the economic second-step optimization is performed. In this point, the whole envelope is insulated early on level 2 to lower the heat demand as much as possible; a pellet boiler in combination with a geothermal HP is used and the entire roof is equipped with PV. A high capacity BAT allows more self-consumption of the produced electricity. The geothermal HP is bought to cover the majority of the cold demand via passive cooling and is therefore remarkably large. VCRS supports cooling on warm days when electricity can be generated by the PV modules. A comparison between the described results of the ecological optimum with the results of the ecological optimum without second-step optimization, shows the advantages of our two-step approach for the ecological optimum: From Fig. 4 it can be analyzed that in both cases the same emissions are emitted with 164 kgCO2/m2. However, the NPV of the ecological optimum (4093.4 \u20ac/m2) is 23% lower than that of the case without the second-step optimization (5345.7 \u20ac/m2). Since in reality no more would be invested than necessary for maximum emission savings, the ecological optimum seems to be a more sensible and realistic solution. The decisions for ESS devices are the same in both compared cases. However, differences in the size of these devices occur which lead to different investment levels and finally different NPV. In the case without the second-step optimization, all devices are used to supply the building, but they are larger than needed, i. e oversized. These too large sized devices do not occur in the ecological optimum and also not in the other Pareto-efficient points. This is possible in the case without the second-step optimization, because if the ecological objective is minimized singularly, there exist multiple optimal solutions which all lead to the same minimal emissions. However, without the second-step optimization, it exists no economic incentive to save emissions with smaller devices. Compared with other conducted case studies, we mainly see similar behavior in selecting ESS devices, but differences in envelope renovations. The need for insulation measures is higher for older buildings and increasing heat losses. Furthermore, these measures strongly depend on the proportion of windows inside the envelope. In buildings like laboratories with higher internal loads compared to office buildings, a full renovation of the envelope is not realized even in the optimal ecological solution. This is due to lower the resulting cold demands. In general, the BES underlies strong changes concerning the used technologies during the schedule. Existing devices are mostly used until their end of lifetime in schedules near the economic optimum in case their size is near the optimal value. Meanwhile schedules with a stronger focus on ecological performance replace them early and in some instances at the beginning of the schedule with modern technologies. Under the conditions set, the results show that the importance of HP will rise in the future. Subsequently, boilers will decrease in size while the use of solar technologies will increase accordingly. Reversible HP (air & geothermal) are chosen in most schedules and especially geothermal energy is used for passive cooling, which is both economically and ecologically efficient. However, in some NRB geothermal energy cannot be used in terms of space restrictions or similar. Optimizations where geothermal HP are not allowed mostly revealed the use of air source HP and rising power of boilers. STC and pellet boilers could be identified to offer high potential in saving carbon emissions economically during the entire schedule. Due to relatively low proceeds for electricity feed-in (section 3.2.3), PV is rather used in the ecological schedules. Storages are used to compensate the volatile production of STC and PV or to raise the full load hours of CHP. TES are usually installed with maximum possible capacity. 4.3 Operation in different years of the schedule For the marked Pareto-efficient point in Fig. 4, Fig 6 shows the operation of the ESS to cover the heat and cold demand of the building. Heating and cooling power of all ESS components are presented for a typical summer and winter day in a year before (2029) and after (2047) many modernization measures were realized. Positive values show heating whereas negative values show cooling. Lines represent the demands and charging of the TES while areas below these lines show the covering of the demands by the ESS. From this, it can be seen that the demands are being met at all times. In 2029, the CHP mainly uses the TES to maximize the duration of cost-efficient electricity self-supply. This is also done in winter 2047. Furthermore, this winter day depicts the advantages of the modernization measures. Not only the heat demand decreased, but also in winter STC combined with the enlarged TES are able to cover a respectable part of necessary heating. On the summer day in 2047, we observe that passive cooling with the reversible geothermal HP can sufficiently cover the main cold demand and is supported by VCRS after midday. Additionally, it can be observed that the cooling peak appears some hours after the solar irradiation peak at midday which is due to the inertia of the building mass that was respected in our dynamic building simulations. 4.4 Comparison with approach without schedule Most approaches in literature have considered initial measures for a building and no varying building energy system that can change over the considered time horizon. In this section, we therefore shortly compare the approach of this work (with scheduling) with an approach where only replacement investments are possible (without scheduling). Our novel approach schedules all modernization measures by optimizing their realization date and thereby determines a chronological sequence. In the comparative approach, only initial measures at one point in time are allowed. In this case, the MILP can only choose the measures in the first year. In the following years, it can only replace plants by the same ones after they reached their lifetimes. Fig. 7 shows the Pareto frontiers of these two approaches around the economic optimum where the modernization schedules with the lowest emissions avoidance costs occur. The frontier with scheduling equals the one in Fig. 4. As the Pareto frontier of the approach without scheduling lies on the right side of the one with scheduling, emissions can be saved more cost-efficiently by the scheduling approach. For example, in the Pareto-efficient point of the approach with scheduling, emissions of 960 kgCO2/m2 cause costs of 708.7 \u20ac/m2 whereas the identical emissions cause 725.6 \u20ac/m2 in the approach without scheduling. We therefore conclude that the presented work reveals so far hidden saving potentials. Furthermore, it gives building owners the possibility to schedule their investments over the next years. However, it needs to be figured out in the future how these advantages vary in other typical buildings, building sizes and under other boundary conditions. 4.5 Scenario analysis As stated in section 3.2.3, we defined boundary conditions for each prospective year of the schedules based on prognoses (Table B.10). However, the prognoses of energy prices and carbon intensity of public electricity have a wide spread and underlie uncertainty [46]. Simultaneously their impact on the optimization problem is high. For this purpose, we varied the values of the scenario given by Ref. [40] and investigate the influence on our model. Fig. 8 shows the relative deviation to the originally set values. Therefore, the course is adopted and the values for energy prices in 2050 are varied by +10% (gas, electricity increase) and −10% (gas, electricity decrease). Concerning carbon intensity the original scenario assumes EU's stated emission reduction goals to be achieved. We investigate a deviation of this assumption by +10% (carbon intensity minor increase) and +20% (carbon intensity major increase). Again, the described typical office building is used in this context to analyze the effect on the BES composition and sizing during the schedule. In general, changes are most evident in investment decisions between 2035 and 2050, which are described in the following. In the years before only minor deviations in the size of some technologies occur. Energy prices have higher impact on economic solutions while carbon intensity has on ecological ones. The values of the objective functions underlie minor changes in case of ecological schedules while economic schedules underlie a little more variance. Decreased gas prices and increased electricity prices show similar results. Larger electricity generating devices and gas-based technologies with consistent power are used throughout the whole schedule. Especially increased electricity prices show investments into larger CHP combined with BAT at more economic solutions. This is due to the accordingly increase of self-consumption and the associated reduction of costs for electricity imports from the grid. These costs are reduced by CHP running at nominal power in many hours at winter and transition days. Additionally, BAT and TES are used to buffer in times with lower demands (e.g. on summer days). Both, lower electricity prices and increased gas prices lead to an earlier transition to electric-based technologies. HP are used together with CHP for the base-load heat demand. On winter days the CHP still uses the TES to increase its running duration and the amount of self-generated electricity. Although the gas price decreases this is because still electricity costs are significantly higher. Especially increased gas prices result in a reduction of BOI after 2035. Additional insulation measures on the roof lower the heat demand and thus gas costs for the CHP. As discussed in subsection 4.1 the yearly cold demand rises with insulation, while peaks are reduced. This peak reduction makes it possible to omit a VCRS and cover the whole cold demand on summer days with a reversible geothermal HP. For the Pareto-efficient solutions which are close to the ecological optimum, no major changes due to energy price deviations are apparent, as electric-based technologies and pellet boiler consistently show superior performance. However, these solutions are influenced by changes of electricity's carbon intensity. This higher carbon intensity results in the design of a large PV instead of STC. This PV is combined with a large BAT, while TES is significantly smaller compared to the carbon reference scenario. Interestingly, PV's generated electricity and power are high enough that still electricity-based devices like HP are built and gas-based systems are reduced. Since cooling and heating is mainly based on electricity in this case, devices are directly supplied by the PV in summer and winter days. In times without solar irradiation, buffered electricity from the BAT is used and heating is supported by pellet-based BOI on winter days. 5 Conclusion and future work This works investigates the optimal scheduling of modernization measures in non-residential buildings. Dynamic thermal simulations were conducted to calculate hourly heat and cold demands of different insulation levels of the envelope. For the scheduling of the measures and the design of the building energy system, a multi-objective MILP was developed. Within this MILP, boundary conditions such as energy prices and investments vary for each year of the schedule. We investigated the general usability and advantages of the proposed method by applying it to a typical office building and comparing our approach with an approach without scheduling the measures. For our application, schedules with three-year modernization intervals were determined for a typical office building. We see advantages in scheduling modernization measures over the lifetime of a building while taking into account dependencies between the renovation measures in different intervals. In contrast to generating measures for a single realization date, the constitution of the BES undergoes multiple changes due to the different boundary conditions in each year of the schedule. Furthermore, emissions can be saved more cost-efficiently than with an approach without scheduled measures. Concerning the envelope's insulation, strong influences of the ratio of heat to cold load and the proportion of the window area could be detected. In general, existing devices are more likely used until their end of lifetime in schedules near the economic optimum, while schedules with a stronger focus on ecological performance replace them with modern technologies early and partly at the beginning of the schedule. Our results reveal that conventional facilities such as gas boilers still show advantages when used over the next years. Between 2030 and 2040, a transition to heat pumps and solar technology shows good economic and ecological performance. In particular, reversible geothermal HPs offer high potential in being used for heating and cooling. Solar thermal plants and pellet boilers show advantages by offering low-emission heat in all years, but it is important to keep in mind that the sustainable availability of pellets is limited. PV is installed in more ecological schedules and often combined with a battery. Thermal energy storages appear to be mostly designed at the maximum possible size. In terms of BES\u2032 operation, storages are used extensively by CHP and PV to maximize self-generated electricity. Passive cooling with a reversible geothermal HP can sufficiently cover many hours of the year but needs support of a VCRS in most Pareto-efficient solutions. Our ongoing scenario analysis indicates that gas and electricity prices greatly affect the speed of transition from gas-based to electricity-based technologies. However, for the near future, changes were detected mainly in the technologies\u2019 various sizes and less in their general selection over a schedule. While the variation in energy prices mainly affects economic solutions, the variation in carbon emission intensity influences more ecological solutions. In the future, more technologies may be noticeable in existing buildings and be added to the presented model. Furthermore, the efficiency of some plants may improve over the next years and this improvement could influence their selection and sizing over a schedule. Implementing performance degradation of the building energy system into the model may help to make schedules more realistic. In terms of data clustering, the heat and cold peak loads could be respected by including them in the clustered data set. In the optimization they could then serve as additional design parameter for the BES. Concerning the boundary conditions (e.g. energy prices), an extended sensitivity analysis could show detailed influences. In this context, also the influence of economic assumptions like the interest rate and our approach of calculating the residual value of ESS devices will be investigated. The application to other typical buildings will indicate in which buildings the generation of modernization is most effective and furthermore offers the possibility to scale up the proposed method to building stocks. Finally, we aim to calculate modernization paths for the German and European energy transition that could show how to achieve the emission-saving goals in a cost-optimal way.

        "dc:description": "Existing non-residential buildings account for a significant proportion of the energy consumption of the European building stock. Modernizing these buildings can significantly contribute to declared emission reduction targets. Modernization measures are rarely realized in the life cycle of buildings but have long-term effects on their energetic performance. Therefore, it is not only essential to identify future-oriented modernization measures but also to schedule them over the life cycle of a building. For this purpose, we present a mixed-integer linear program that schedules measures for a building energy system including envelope and supply system. The program determines not only the optimal combination of modernization measures but also the respective optimal point of time when each measure shall be realized. A multi-objective optimization is conducted to minimize carbon emissions and net present value. Thermal demand profiles serve as input for the optimization model and are calculated preliminary using dynamic simulations. Constraints and boundary conditions are specified separately for each prospective year of the schedule's time horizon. Results showed that the constitution of a building energy system changes several times throughout a schedule. Determined Pareto-efficient solutions reveal that carbon emissions could be saved more cost-efficiently than with approaches without scheduling.",
