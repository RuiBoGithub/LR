Handling Editor: X Zhao Recent technological advancements in the HVAC industry enable optimized occupant thermal satisfaction and system efficiency, thanks to better control of the comfort parameter. Current work aims to automatically control the thermal comfort parameters: dry bulb temperature, air-velocity, and relative humidity. This is achieved using an air handling unit (AHU) equipped with a fresh air control for air quality control, a chiller unit that runs on a VCR cycle for cooling and dehumidification, an ultrasonic mist humidification system, and an air volume control system installed in the ductwork for temperature control. These systems are automatically controlled based on the feedback from various sensors installed in the target space to fit to the ASHRAE Standard 55. Experiments are conducted for varying air velocity at different daytime periods in Dubai. Air temperature and humidity are measured at each stage of the AHU. Total time for achieving thermal comfort is recorded. Results indicated that maximum coefficient of performance (COP), dehumidification effectiveness (DE), humidification effectiveness (HE), predicted mean vote (PMV) and bypass factor were 8.60, 0.96, 36%, −0.62 and 0.48 respectively when outdoor conditions reached 42 °C and 50% RH. The operational efficiency of the current adaptive-controlled system is found to be 21.50% more efficient than a conventional system.

Primary factors that influence the thermal comfort are the air temperature, mean radiant temperature, air velocity, relative humidity, and their variation; as well as the personal parameters of clothing insulation and metabolic rate [1]. Increasing the quality of life worldwide yields more exigent indoor thermal environments, and the advancements in the Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) industry have led to the addition of various controllable parameters that influence the thermal comfort. At the same time, due to the rise in energy wastage, the demand-based HVAC control systems have gained relevance. About a third majority of global final energy is consumed in buildings, almost half for space and water heating [2], while space cooling energy consumption has more than tripled in the last three decades [3]. Demand response technique is used to adjust the generation to the consumers energy demand, hence minimizing the energy wastage [4,5]. In Dubai climatic condition,70% of the overall energy consumption by the building is utilized to maintain the thermal comfort inside the room and the remaining 30% is used by other HVAC and household equipment. In residential buildings, small mass of inlet air from the return duct is recirculated while major portion is discharged outside. When the return air mixes with the inlet air, the load of the AC unit drops. This control is achieved by either fresh air handling unit (FAHU) or air handling unit [25]. Adaptive control is a sort of \u201cHard Control\u201d (HC) [6,7]. An adaptive control strategy for Demand Response in HVAC is a system that can maintain the indoor thermal comfort parameters at an adequate level, despite unexpected deviations from the design and operating conditions [8]. Consequently, it is the best option for applications where unpredictable conditions may occur. With this aim, the adaptive control system monitors the air related data and calibrates them regularly. It effectively controls the HVAC system [5,9,10]. In this work, an adaptive HVAC control is implemented with the use of an Air-Handling Unit (AHU) with Variable Air Volume (VAV) that operates based on feedback received from various sensors installed within the conditioned space, as illustrated in Fig. 1 . Air at outdoor ambient conditions passes through the AHU and meets the thermal comfort conditions in the target room. It is expected that the proposed system offers advantages such as effective control of the air conditioning operation, maintaining desired temperature and humidity, and fresh air supply. The application of adaptive control for HVAC&R systems dates back to 1980 [6]. Since then, several researchers worked on adaptive control strategies for HVAC. Huang et al. [11] study through simulation an adaptive control for regulating the VAV HVAC system, which proves to be a simple strategy with good temperature regulation, with 17% energy savings. Lymperopoulos and Ioannou [9,12] achieve optimal building zoning by adaptive temperature regulation. Also to maintain the indoor desired temperatures, but focusing on residential HVAC systems, Wu et al. [5] achieve better temperature tracking and faster convergence with an adaptive control strategy. Sakuma and Nishi [4] propose the adaptive control to ensure uniform comfort throughout the target spaces, overcoming the effect of different shapes and partitioning, as well as diffusers location. However, no existing research approaches the combined adaptive control of indoor temperature, humidity and air quality. Present work provides experimental evidence at a laboratory scale for this complete control for an optimized indoor comfort environment. There is also literature published focusing on the design and performance of Air Handling Units to supply air at the desired conditions for different applications. Noussan et al. [13] investigated the performance of an AHU serving a university classroom. Based on the occupancy of the class, energy consumption was evaluated. Comparison of the AHU performance with the historical data was carried out, and results showed a reduced energy loss due to the use of a prompter fault measurement device. Kusiak et al. [14] and Moradi et al. [15] developed a nonlinear model to reduce the energy consumption of an AHU that maintained the temperature, relative humidity, and pressure in a predetermined range. An electromagnetism-like algorithm was proposed to solve the proposed model. Results indicated that the AHU energy consumption was reduced by 23%. Razban et al. [16] built a real time energy management system to improve the AHU, containing a wireless monitoring system to record the data. System saved 77,141 kWh of energy by identifying the malfunctions of simultaneously turning on both cooling and preheater coil. Park et al. [17] compared the AHU DAT fixed control strategy with the AHU DAT set point reset strategy which changed according to the outdoor conditions. Reset strategy gave higher energy savings by minimizing the utilization of the chiller unit. Kny et al. [18] focused on the measurement of the parameters at an AHU using Peltier system, built to ventilate residential and administrative buildings. They used Peltier effect for performing the precooling of the return air that mixed with the fresh air. AHU with Peltier gave less performance compared to an AHU using a VCR unit. Air leakage and its effect on the performance in an AHU was studied by Srinivasan et al. [19]. The Coefficient of discharge was found to increase up to 0.96 for the lowest air Reynold's number of 5600. Yu et al. [20] reviewed the fault detection and diagnosis method for an AHU. Various techniques were discussed when aiming to minimize the energy loss in AHU. Licina and Sekhar [21] used the condensate collected from several AHU units to precool the warm humid air and supplied it to a cooling tower. It efficiently reduced the temperature of the water. Results indicated that condensate production in various AHUs were enough to precool the air with an energy saving of 10% and was able to meet the cooling tower demand. In this work, the proposed AHU is equipped with cooling, dehumidification, and humidification stages. Suranjan et al. [22] carried out dehumidification process in Dubai using helical copper coils working with chilled water supplied by a VCR unit. Fresh water of 2.57 l/h was collected due to condensation process, and 2 m/s air flow rate was found to be optimal. Humidification is implemented through a misting system, due to less operational cost of evaporative cooling for humidification in hot climates like Dubai [23]. Horr et al. [26] investigated the FAHU in gulf climate which was integrated with VCR and evaporative cooling unit. System gave COP of 3.4 with a sensible cooling load saving of 60%. System reduced the energy consumption by 36%. Similarly, urban sustainability in the Gulf region was studied by Winter et al. [27] where the focus was on the thermal comfort using the adaptive air conditioning system. Consequently, the aim of this work is. - Provide evidence of the adaptive control of temperature, humidity and airflow in HVAC systems for an optimized indoor thermal environment. - Comprehensively evaluate the performance of each stage at the AHU, in terms of humidification and dehumidification effectiveness, evaporation and moisture removal rate, and energy efficiency.

Even the average relative humidity is around 60% round the year. Especially during the summer seasons air conditioning systems consume a lot of energy. To reduce the energy consumption an attempt has been done in the present system wherein the entire process of reaching the thermal comfort conditions has been automated which can be called as adaptive air handling. An automated air handling unit is proposed to control the temperature and humidity inside the room with the reduction of the energy consumption. 2.1 Experimental test rig assembly and operation A scheme of the experimental test rig is shown in Fig. 2 B. It is divided into two main components: first, the Air-handling unit (AHU) that supplies conditioned air into the target spaces; and second, the target conditioned space and the automation components of the feedback-based controller that regulates the different stages of the AHU. Fig. 2 C shows a view of the different components of the AHU, the conditioned space and the control system. Fig. 3 shows a global view of the experimental rig (see Fig. 4). The AHU frame is fabricated using ½-inch PVC tubes and equipped with couplers for the installation of various internal components, including: a 4-inch motorized air volume control damper (VCD), blower, humidifier, cooling coil, dehumidification through condensation coil, return air ducting & exhaust, and 6-inch fresh air control (FAC) motorized damper. All these components are regulated via an Arduino Mega R3 Board 2560 control unit. A chilled water unit regulated by a set-point controller is installed below the AHU to supply cold water to the coil. The AHU unit is supported by a structure fabricated from the same ½-inch PVC tubing. The supply air is ducted to the air-conditioned space (ACS)of 1 m3 from the VCDs using 4-inch thermal mineral wool flexible insulation Rockwool Flex®. The return air from the room is ducted to the return air chamber using the same Rockwool 4-inch insulated flexible ducting. A 6-inch Fresh Air control (FAC) motorized damper regulates the amount of fresh air entering the room in terms of the measure of the target air quality parameters within the ACS. The fresh air then mixes with the return air from the conditioned space. The return air from the ACS re-enters the AHU for recirculation via a return air junction. A 3.5 m3/min exhaust fan is installed to exhaust the return air outdoors if required. The airflow is then driven through two four-circuit chilled-water cooling coils made of 3/8-inch copper piping with outer dimensions of 300 × 320 mm each. The first coil is intended for sensible heat exchange, to condition the air to be supplied as per the required temperature, while the second is intended for condensation-based dehumidification. Both coils operate with chilled water from a 25 L tank, equipped with a chilled water unit that operates on 0.5-ton VCR operation as per set-point control. Two pumps with a mass flow rate of 0.9 kg/s are used to circulate the water through both coils. The air further interacts with an ultrasonic humidifier to maintain the Relative Humidity (RH) within the ACS between 50 and 60%. The humidifier can increase the relative humidity from 39% to 52% within 5 min of operation. A blower of 0.5HP and 3-inch outer diameter drives the conditioned air from the AHU unit into the ACS via VCD. Its outlet velocity is maintained between 3 m/s to 5 m/s with the help of a regulator. The conditioned air is then supplied to the space via a 4-inch motorized VCD to regulate the heat exchange per the ACS's requirement. Table 1 gathers the specifications of the components of the AHU unit. 2.2 Sensors The measuring sensors used in the AHU and their specifications are described in Table 2 . The ACS is equipped with the feedback sensors described in Table 3 , connected to an Arduino Mega R3; Board 2560 control unit to regulate the operation of the AHU and maintain the thermal comfort range within the ACS. Temperature and humidity sensors are connected to the Arduino Mega controller and controls relay connected to the compressor. When the set point temperature is equal to the temperature in the room, a signal is sent to the Arduino controller and then the controller upon receiving the signal is programmed to turn off the compressor but turning off a relay connected in series to the compressor. An AQ \u2013 dust sensor 3.is connected to the Arduino Mega Controller and controls the FAC & exhaust fan. This sensor detects the dust infiltration level within the space and in the atmosphere outdoors. When it detects high dust levels above 15 μg/m3, feedback is sent to Arduino Mega Controller, which is programmed to activate the exhaust fan. The exhaust is programmed to operate until the dust levels drops below 15 μg/m3. A gas sensor is connected to the Arduino Mega Controller and controls the FAC and the exhaust fan. The gas sensor detects the CO2 and CO levels within the space and atmosphere. When the CO2 level detected exceeds1000 ppm, the Arduino Mega Controller activates the exhaust fan. The presence sensor is used to detect the occupants within the room. When the Arduino Mega controller receives negative signal from the space, the controller is programmed to regulate the keyestudio L298 N motor controller to close the VCD as well as suspend the operation of the compressor by turning off a relay connected in series to the compressor. When the sensor detects presence in the room, the Arduino mega controller is programmed to turn on a relay connected in series to the compressor and hence allows the operation of the compressor. The controller also regulates the keyestudio L298 N motor controller to open the VCD of the room where an occupant is detected. The Motion Sensor connected to Arduino Mega controller controls the amount air flow supplied to the room by controlling the VCD position. When the sensor detects motion within the space, feedback is sent to the Arduino Mega Controller, which is programmed to regulate keyestudio L298 N motor controller to suspend the VCD in fully open position. If the sensor senses negative signal within the space, the controller regulates the keyestudio L298 N motor controller to suspend the VCD in partially open position allowing minimal air flow into the space. 2.3 Control flowcharts Fig. 5 A gives the flow chart of the presence and motion sensors. The role of the presence sensor is to detect occupancy within a room by detecting the heat emitted by the occupant. If the presence sensor triggers \u201chigh,\u201d it will trigger the AHU to start operating, and the motorized dampers will open to allow airflow into the required space. This enables the system to air-condition individual spaces automatically. The algorithm works in conjunction with a motion sensor to determine the level of airflow into the space. If the motion sensor detects \u201chigh,\u201d suggesting that the occupant is doing an activity, the air-condition system will allow more air into the space, maintaining thermal comfort. The temperature within the subjective space, as mapped in Fig. 5 B, is controlled by regulating the amount of conditioned air flowing into the room. Supposing that the temperature sensor records the temperature the space over 27 °C (with reference to ASHRAE standard 55 [24]), in that case, the VCD will be fully open, allowing maximum airflow from AHU into the room. In contrast, minimal conditioned air shall be supplied if the temperature is within the thermal comfort range of 22\u201327 °C. The humidity within the cooling space is regulated by the HDH system, as illustrated in Fig. 5 C, which consists of a misting system for increasing the humidity and a dehumidifying coil for condensation-based humidification. Supposing that the humidity level detected in the target space is above 50% RH, the misting system will be inactive, while the dehumidifying coil will be active, and vice versa if the detected RH value drops below 40% RH. If the humidity level detected is moderate and in accordance with ASHRAE standard 55, both the misting device and the dehumidifying coil will be inactive. 2.4 Tests conducted Experiments are conducted by varying the air velocity and at different timelines of a day. To simulate the real-life human load inside a room, a heat source of 100, 150 and 200 W is placed inside the room. The main idea behind this work is to maintain the thermal comfort of the room by operating the AHU accordingly. Sensors read the thermal parameters and the Arduino program controls the units of AHU unit to attain ASHRAE 55 standards. Table 4 gives the experimental conditions. Outdoor air conditions varied during the tested daytime periods as given in Table 5 . 3 Parameters studied Air enters the air handling unit and comes in contact with the helical coil where the cold water is circulated, condensation takes place when it interacts with cold coil powered by VCR unit. Condensation or moisture removal rate is given by equation (1). m c ˙ is the mass flow rate of condensate, m a ˙ is the air flow rate, kg/s, W1 and W2 are inlet and outlet specific humidity, g/kg. (1) m c ˙ = m a ˙ ( w 1 − w 2 ) Evaporation rate during humidification is given by equation (2) where m w ˙ is the rate of air, g/s and W3 is the specific humidity of air after humidification.

It is given by equation (3). (3) D E = W 1 − W 2 W 1 − W e q Similarly, humidification effectiveness is defined as given by equation (4) which is defined as the ratio of change in the temperature to the difference between inlet temperature and the inlet wet bulb temperature of the humidifier.T2 and T3 are the inlet and outlet temperature of the humidifier where as Twet is the wet bulb temperature at the inlet of the humidifier.

It is given in equation (4). Δh is change in enthalpy and W ˙ is the total work done. (5) C O P = Δ h W ˙ Thermal comfort can be defined through two parameters, namely the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) and the Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied (PPD) people. These parameters are evaluated using equations (5) and (6) (6) P M V = ( 0.303 e 2.1 * M + 0.028 ) * [ ( M − W ) − H − E c − C r e s − E r e s ] (7) P P D = 100 − 95 e − ( 0.03353 * P M V 4 + 0.2179 * P M V 2 ) Where M is the metabolic rate, W/m2, W is the effective mechanical power, W/m2, H is the sensitive heat loses, W/m2, Ec is the heat exchanged by the evaporation on the skin, W/m2, Cres is the heat exchange by convection, W/m2, and Eres is the evaporation rate exchange in breathing, W/m2. Reynold's number is a dimensionless number which is defined by a ratio of the momentum of the fluid to its shear force. ρ is the density, kg/m3, V is the velocity, m/s, D is the hydraulic diameter, m, and μ is the dynamic viscosity, Pa-s. (8) R e = ρ V D μ 3.1 Uncertainty analysis Because the input parameters in the AHU are calculated based on various measurements, a certain error is expected. This influences the output parameters. The uncertainty analysis determines the result reliability of an engineering problem, without which, the performance cannot be evaluated. Let X1, X2 \u2026 \u2026. Xn be the independent variables distributed normally and y1, y2 \u2026. yn be the uncertainty intervals. U be the function. Uncertainty of the dependent variable w R is given by equation (7) (9) w R = [ ( δ U δ X 1 y 1 ) 2 + ( δ U δ X 2 y 2 ) 2 + ( δ U δ X 3 y 3 ) 2 + \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 . + ( δ U δ X w n ) 2 ] 0.5 uncertainty values for the dependent variables calculated are shown in Table 6 . 4 Results and discussion 4.1 Temperature and RH variation at each stage Fig. 6 (a) and 6 (b) gives the temperature and RH variation after passing through the dehumidifying coil and the ultrasonic humidifier along the entire day for varying air Reynold's number. Maximum temperature drop is observed in the dehumidification section when air interacts with the cold coil. The vapor condensation reduces the specific humidity of the air which is leaving the dehumidifier section. Ultrasonic humidifier supplies the mist which interacts with the dehumidified cold air. The humidifier drops the temperature even further with the rise in the specific humidity. This drop and rise in the specific humidity and temperature are responsible for maintaining thermal comfort inside the space. Experimental results indicated that temperature and RH value are slightly higher at the afternoon time 13:30 h, which occurs when the performance of the overall system decreases due to maximum demand, whereas experiments at 9:30, 11:30 and 15:30 show relatively less temperature and relative humidity. For higher air Reynolds number, from 9:30 to13:30 there is a rise in the dehumidification and humidification temperature by 16.93% and 9.2% and there is a drop in the values by 10.34% and 3.8% for the time period from 13:30 to 15:30. Humidification process follows the similar trend. Also, for higher air Reynold's number there is a difference of 15.68% temperature and 5.55% relative humidity at the peak hours of the day. Temperature and relative humidity are noted down and plotted at the inlet, after dehumidifier, humidifier, room and at the return air condition which is shown in Fig. 7 (a) and 7 (c). Air at 42ᵒC passes through the dehumidifier unit and undergoes condensation by which the temperature and the relative humidity reduces. Air passes through the mist generated by the ultrasonic humidifier, which drops its temperature by a small amount while the RH increases. As according to the indoor loads, return air will gain heat and humidity it exits out with increased temperature and humidity which is out of thermal comfort zone. Figure (b) and (d) show the temperature and RH inside the room for different time periods. Graphical representation shows that, as the time passes, there is a rise in the relative humidity and a drop in the temperature till it achieves a thermal comfort condition. To achieve the thermal comfort condition, a minimum time period of 300 s is required. The change in the air velocity significantly influences the thermal properties inside the room. 4.2 Variation of the performance parameters with the air Reynold's number Air is initially dehumidified and its temperature drops as it interacts with the chilled water coils. Moisture removal rate or condensation rate gives the amount of moisture removed from the air. At peak time, the moisture content or specific humidity in the air is higher; therefore, maximum condensation takes place. Even through there is a slight fluctuation in the difference in the specific humidity, due to the increase in the mass flow rate of air there is a rise in the moisture removal rate with rising Re. Moisture removal rate of 5.5 g/s is observed for higher air Re and at 13:30 h. Concerning the evaporation rate in the ultrasonic humidifier, it is found at 13:30 p.m., there is only a small rise in the evaporation rate compared to the earlier experiments. This is because a small rise in the relative humidity is sufficient to achieve thermal comfort conditions in the room at the peak period. The increase in the evaporation rate with the air Re is due to the rise in the mass flow rate of air. When the air Re increased from 21,049 to 63,149 there is a rise in the evaporation rate by 109.67% and 125% at 9:30 and 13:30 h. Fig. 8 (c) shows a decrease in the dehumidification effectiveness, since there is a drop in the change in the specific humidity with the Re. At the lowest Re value of 21,049, the system yields the highest dehumidification effectiveness of 0.96, due to the maximum contact time between the cold coils and the air. This leads to maximum condensation. Fig. 8 (d) gives the variation of humidification efficiency with the Re. With the increase in the air flow rate there is a decrease in the temperature drop, hence in the humidification efficiency. At lower air velocity the residence time increases, thus the air mixes with the mist generated by the ultrasonic humidifier more effectively, yielding a higher temperature drop. At the lowest Re, the value of the humidification efficiency is 270% higher at 13:30 h as compared to 9:30 h and there is a drop in the efficiency by 22.22% when the air Re is increased to 63,149. AAs the air Re increases, the system COP also rises, as shown in Fig. 8 (e). When the air Re increased from 21,049 to 63,149, there is a rise in the COP by 172.72% at 13:30 h. This implies that maximum performance of the adaptive control unit is higher at the peak time and it reduces for other time lines of the day. Finally, time required to achieve thermal comfort inside the room is depicted in Fig. 8 (f) for various timelines during the day hours and air Re. It is found that with the increase in the air velocity, time taken to achieve the thermal comfort reduces. This is because more volume of air is drawn into the room to meet the standards. It takes 365 s and 340 s for the adaptive control unit at lowest Re to achieve comfort at 13:30 and 9:30 h, respectively, with a difference of 7.35% between them. When the air Re increased from 21,049 to 63,149, there is a drop in the time required by 8.21%. 4.3 Thermal comfort PMV is used to predict the thermal comfort range whereas predicted percentage dissatisfaction (PPD) predicts the number of people dissatisfied. The range of the PPD should be less than 15% and the PMV value should be within the range −1 to +1 for the best thermal comfort; positive value represents a warmer thermal sensation and negative represent a cooler one. Various factors such as metabolic activity, ambient temperature, radiant temperature, RH, air velocity and clothing insulation are related to PMV. Fig. 9 (a) shows the predicted mean vote (PMV) value variation with the air Reynold's number. PMV ranges between −0.595 and −0.627. It means that the target space meets the thermal comfort standard. Experiments conducted at the 9:30 h displayed PMV closer to thermal neutrality (0), compared to that of 13:30 h, which means that at earlier hours the system achieves comfort more easily, while at the peak hour it will consume more energy. As the Reynold's number rises, there is a drop in the PMV value from −0.595 to −0.605 during the peak hours. This may be due to the consistent interaction between the air with the humidifier or dehumidifier unit before reaching the room; that is, higher air velocity hinders the target of thermal comfort due to shorter interaction times. Similarly, PPD is found to be closer to 15% at the peak hours and least at 9:30 h. With the rise in the air Reynold's number from 21,049 to 63,149, the PPD rises by 1.09% and 1.11% at 13:30 and 9:30 h, respectively. 4.4 Comparison of energy consumption and cost to an air conditioning unit Fig. 10 shows the comparison between the adaptive control unit with the conventional air conditional system. Tests are done at the peak hour (13:30), varying the air Reynold's number. Power consumption, total cost and the time required to achieve thermal comfort for both the target adaptive control system and a conventional air condition system have been recorded, plotted and presented in the form of graph. Fig. 10 (a) and 10 (b) give the power consumption and cost involved to maintain thermal comfort with varying air velocity. It is found that power consumption and cost of operation are higher for the conventional air conditioning system. With the increase in the air Reynold's number and the room indoor heat source, there is a rise in the power consumption and cost for both the systems. But the conventional AC systems requires more energy than the adaptive control system. This rise is because the air conditioning unit supplies a fixed amount of power at any given condition, but the adaptive control unit keeps adapting the power value to obtain the best thermal comfort condition which minimizes the power usage. For the higher Reynold's number of 63,149 there is power saving of 21.05% with the use of adaptive control unit when the heat load inside the room is 200 W. Similarly, the adaptive control system saves 26.47% of the total cost per hour at the highest load conditions as compared with the conventional air condition system. Fig. 10 (c) gives the details of total time taken to achieve thermal comfort for both adaptive control and conventional air conditioning systems. Three heat sources 100, 150 and 200 W are considered, and the systems are operated to bring the temperature and RH to the standard conditions. At the lowest air Reynold's number, the time taken for achieving the thermal comfort is higher, which eventually drops with the rise in the air Re. At higher Re, there is an appropriate circulation of the air inside the room, with the consequent rapid control of the thermal parameters. When the Re number is increased from 21,049 to 63,149, the time taken by the air condition system and adaptive control system to achieve comfort drops by 14.81% and 10.81%, respectively, for the highest heat load of 200 W. Similarly, the air conditioning system is 37.07% faster in controlling the room thermal properties compared to that of the adaptive control system at lower Re and higher heat load conditions. After conducting the experiments, the best results obtained by the adaptive control system are presented in Table 7 . It is found that the adaptive control system effectively maintained the thermal comfort conditions inside the target space and the power consumption required is less than that of a conventional air conditioning system. But the time taken to maintain the standard is slightly higher in the adaptive control system compared to that of the conventional system. 4.5 Validation of the current result with that of the literature Results obtained by the current work are compared with that of the literature and is found that the results are at par with the other systems and even better in many cases. Table .8 shows the details of the validation of the results. 5 Conclusions An adaptive control system is integrated within an air handling unit (AHU) to maintain the thermal comfort inside a target space at a laboratory scale. Energy management system in the AHU helps to identify the various factors that affects the energy consumption in the room to improve the energy efficiency. Various performance parameters are evaluated by varying the air Re at different daytime periods. A transient analysis is carried to study the variation of the indoor thermal parameters before achieving thermal comfort conditions. The main conclusions drawn from the present work are presented below. 1. Both the PMV and PPD values indicate that thermal comfort is achieved in the room. Predicted mean vote (PMV) value is found to be within −0.595 to −0.605 during the peak hours. Similarly, predicted percentage dissatisfaction (PPD) is found to be closer to 15% at the peak hours and improves at 9:30 h. 2. Experimental results indicated that temperature and RH are slightly higher at the afternoon time (13:30 h), may be due to the reduction in the performance of the overall system due to maximum energy and mass transfer. 3. Maximum condensation took place at the peak time of 13.30 h. Moisture removal rate of 5.5 g/s is observed for the highest air Re at 13:30 h. A minimum time of 300 s is required to achieve thermal comfort. 4. At the lowest air velocity, the system yields the highest dehumidification effectiveness of 0.96, due to the maximum contact of air with the cold coils. This leads to maximum condensation. 5. Adaptive control system saves 26.47% of the total cost per hour at the highest load conditions compared with the conventional air condition system. 6. A power saving of 21.05% is observed tor the higher Re with the use of adaptive control unit when compared with the conventional AC unit for the heat load inside the room of 200 W. Overall, the adaptive control system is a sustainable system to maintain indoor thermal comfort, which also minimizes the energy consumption compared to a conventional air conditioning system. The system presents advantages such as automatic thermal comfort regulation, high air quality, reduced energy consumption etc. The system performance changes with the number of occupants, different time of the day span and different seasons or climatic conditions. Therefore, based on the automatic thermal comfort achieving option and power saving characteristics, this unit is effective compared to the conventional units exists in Dubai.

        "dc:description": "Recent technological advancements in the HVAC industry enable optimized occupant thermal satisfaction and system efficiency, thanks to better control of the comfort parameter. Current work aims to automatically control the thermal comfort parameters: dry bulb temperature, air-velocity, and relative humidity. This is achieved using an air handling unit (AHU) equipped with a fresh air control for air quality control, a chiller unit that runs on a VCR cycle for cooling and dehumidification, an ultrasonic mist humidification system, and an air volume control system installed in the ductwork for temperature control. These systems are automatically controlled based on the feedback from various sensors installed in the target space to fit to the ASHRAE Standard 55. Experiments are conducted for varying air velocity at different daytime periods in Dubai. Air temperature and humidity are measured at each stage of the AHU. Total time for achieving thermal comfort is recorded. Results indicated that maximum coefficient of performance (COP), dehumidification effectiveness (DE), humidification effectiveness (HE), predicted mean vote (PMV) and bypass factor were 8.60, 0.96, 36%, −0.62 and 0.48 respectively when outdoor conditions reached 42 °C and 50% RH. The operational efficiency of the current adaptive-controlled system is found to be 21.50% more efficient than a conventional system.",
