A non-intrusive data-driven model for detailed occupants\u2019 activities classification in residential buildings using environmental and energy usage data Young Ran Yoon Ye Rin Lee Sun Ho Kim Jeong Won Kim Hyeun Jun Moon \u204e Department of Architectural Engineering, Dankook University, Yongin, South Korea Department of Architectural Engineering Dankook University Yongin South Korea Department of Architectural Engineering, Dankook University, Yongin, South Korea \u204e Corresponding author. Recently, in many existing buildings, detailed energy consumption data and various indoor/outdoor environmental data could be collected by BEMS (Building energy management system) or monitoring systems. Since the characteristics of the occupants (e.g., behavior and status) affect the indoor environment, it is possible to predict occupant information by developing an inverse model that utilizes environmental data. In this study, we proposed a method for detecting detailed occupants activities based on environmental data (e.g., temperature, relative humidity, CO 2 , concentrations, and dust concentrations) and energy consumption data (e.g., related to heating and cooling, lighting, and electronic appliances) which can be monitored in buildings. To this end, the occupants\u2019 characteristics (e.g., what the occupants do for 24 h and how often they do it) were investigated through experiments in which subjects live in a test-bed similar to a residential environment. In this study, we identified that seven specific activities of the occupants (sleeping, resting, working, cooking, eating, exercising, and away) accounted for 98% of the total behavior. Furthermore, the major environmental factors affecting the classification model were identified. The occupants' activities detection accuracy of the three classification algorithms including Random forest (RF), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), and Support vector machine (SVM) was compared and analyzed. The best performance of the model for the occupants' activities was achieved by RF. And the combination of environmental variables and energy use variables of the equipment led to improved accuracy of the average f1-score of 0.94. Detection for detailed activities of occupants was made possible by the development of a classification model using machine learning algorithms, which is expected to be further used for automatic control systems based on the prediction of occupants\u2019 activities and status.

In particular, it is essential to identify the occupant activities in a room to establish effective cooling control as the control strategy varies depending on the occupant status, such as non-occupancy, active status, or sleep. The occupants\u2019 activities can be determined efficiently and economically if the parameters can easily be monitored in the building and the minimum number of variables can be utilized. Numerous researchers have emphasized the influence of occupants' behaviour on energy consumption and expected energy savings [1-3]. Murakami et al. [4] showed that an interactive control system that can control an air conditioning system based on the occupants\u2019 requests and provide a variety of feedback was able to reduce the energy consumption by 20% compared with the case in which an air conditioning system was set to maintain a constant temperature of 26 °C. Another study suggested a user-centric distributed control system that learns personal preferences [5]. Feldmeier and Paradiso reported a 24% savings in heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system energy consumption with improved thermal comfort. Erickson and Cerpa [6] reported that using a prediction model to match the feedback provided by the occupants resulted in their full satisfaction for the thermal conditions and energy savings of up to 10.1%. Gao and Keshav [7] proposed a method of mapping the predicted mean vote (PMV) based on a simple regression model used by occupants, which saved energy up to 60%. As above, reducing energy consumption and providing tenants with thermal comfort has become an important consideration for energy-efficient buildings. This is because the occupant's activity affects thermal comfort due to metabolic changes, thus affecting HVAC control [8,9]. Therefore, it is necessary to recognize information on various activities of occupants in the building (e.g. sleeping, cooking, eating, resting, etc.) to save energy of the building and control the indoor environment based on thermal comfort. Recently, many researchers have relied on the occupant activities collected through various measurement methods, e.g., passive infrared (PIR) sensors, door sensors, video cameras, and smartphones [10-13]. In a similar study, Lillo et al. [14] identified human activities in a residential space using a hierarchical compositional model based on RGB-D camera measurements. In addition, Wannenburg and Malekian [15] made use of the data obtained from the accelerometers of smartphones to study the situations of occupants when walking, standing, sitting, lying down, and running. Ten machine learning techniques were applied and compared, and all 10 techniques yielded accuracy greater than 90.0%. Tapia et al. [16] implemented state-change sensors in 84 locations in actual residential space and used the acquired data to determine the occupant activities. Dodier et al. [17] used a PIR sensor and Bayesian probability theory to detect the presence of occupants in an office. However, this method has limitations in its actual applications to buildings although these measurement methods are effective in detecting occupancy. For example, camera measurements raise privacy issues, and the smartphone-based method has a disadvantage in that it cannot be used to determine the situation of an occupant when the smartphone is detached from his or her body. To overcome these drawbacks, the number of measurement sensors is increased or various types of sensors are combined and installed throughout the room, which is expensive and may decrease efficiency. Recently, in many existing buildings, various indoor/outdoor environmental data, such as temperature, relative humidity, and CO 2 , are collected by various monitoring systems. As the characteristics of the occupants such as behavior and status affect the indoor environment, it is possible to take the occupant information into consideration for optimal thermal control by developing an inverse (or data-driven) model that utilizes environmental data. In addition, since the power consumption of a building measured using smart meters, etc. also reflects the correlation between the occupant who uses the building and the energy consumption of the equipment, it greatly helps grasp occupant information. The relationship between occupant information and the data on energy consumption and environment is far from being straightforward, thus making it appropriate to grasp information through machine learning-based modeling [18]. Hence, various studies have been conducted to predict the activity of occupants based on machine learning using environmental data and energy consumption data (Table 1 ). Candanedod and Feldheim [19] developed a machine learning-based detection model for office occupant activity utilizing data on temperature, humidity, CO 2 , and lighting, and predicted occupancy with a fairly high accuracy of 99%. And Ryu and Moon [20] developed a detection and prediction model for the presence of occupants based on CO 2 , lighting, and power consumption data. These studies, however, have their limitations in that they only show the presence/absence information of the occupants without being able to distinguish detailed activities. More importantly, prediction for detailed occupant activities (e.g. sleeping, cooking, eating, resting, etc.) has not been possible since occupant activity classification according to what the occupant does when living in a real residence has not yet been studied. In addition, there has been little research on what influences variables in predicting an occupants\u2019 detailed activities and which prediction models are most effective. We propose a non-intrusive method for detecting detailed activities of occupants based on both environmental data, such as temperature, humidity, CO 2 concentration, and fine dust concentration that can be monitored in buildings and power consumption data related to lighting and electronic products. The first step in this study is to identify the actual occupants\u2019 activities (e.g., what the occupants do for 24 h and how often they do it) through experiments in which they live in a test-bed similar to a residential environment. The occupants\u2019 information obtained in this manner is then used as the dependent variable for the occupants\u2019 activity model. We develop an occupant activity detection model by applying classification algorithms which are identifying the occupants' activities based on environmental data and energy consumption data as predictors. In addition, the major environmental factors affecting the model are identified, and the prediction accuracy of three different classification algorithms is compared and analyzed. This study tries to contribute to developing a non-intrusive data-driven model without using cameras or cell phones for predicting detailed occupants' activities. Detailed activities of occupants can be used in sophisticated HVAC control for efficient indoor thermal comfort and healthy air quality. The main contributions are as follows, - Characterization of occupant behavior through detailed classification of occupants\u2019 activities (e.g., sleeping, cooking, eating, resting, etc.): This can be used for comfort control based on occupants' behavior when controlling air conditioner and heating systems. In particular, when maintaining thermal comfort in indoor spaces, metabolic equivalent of task (MET) values for each occupants\u2019 activities can be calculated and applied to advanced thermal comfort control, i.e., PMV control. - Detailed occupants\u2019 activities for energy saving: based on the accurate occupants' activities and statues in residential spaces, one can turn on the right environmental devices or turn off unnecessary appliances without compensating occupants' thermal comfort. Prediction of activities can be used for model predictive control as well. - Identification of important variables affecting the prediction of occupant behavior. Cost-effective sensor networks and monitoring structures can be designed in buildings for environment and energy management systems. - Investigation of the most accurate and efficient machine learning algorithms for classification models to predict detailed occupants\u2019 activities. State-of-the-art machine learning algorithms are tested with a data set collected from an experiment with one-minute time-step data for 9 days in a test-bed. 2 Methodology 2.1 Research process Figure 1 shows the organization and procedures of this paper. In this study, in order to implement the detailed occupants\u2019 activity model, data are collected by monitoring the actual occupant activities in a test-bed with two subjects. To understand the true value of the occupants\u2019 activity, image data is separately collected using a web camera installed in the test-bed. Visual investigation for images proceeds to classify detailed activities and labels in every minute. The minute-by-minute data, including indoor environment data and energy consumption data, are processed through normalization and imbalanced data processing. In this study, three classification algorithms are tested. Also, K-fold cross-validation is conducted for validation. The performance of each model is evaluated through f1-score and accuracy. Python is used to implement the model. The detailed technical statements are described in the following sections. 2.2 Classification algorithms It is well known that there are three main machine learning approaches: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. The technique used for occupants\u2019 activities detection in this study is supervised learning, which learns a function that maps an input to an output based on example input\u2013output pairs. Since this learning method involves inferring a function from labeled training data consisting of a set of training examples, it is mainly used when the object to be analyzed is known in advance. Many classification algorithms can be used for occupants\u2019 activities detection. Representative classification techniques include the SVM [23,27], KNN [24,27], RF [19], ANN [28], Bayesian classification [26], and Genetic algorithms. In a previous study by Zhenghua Chen et al. [29] among these various models, human activity study based on smartphone sensors using KNN, RF, and SVM, which showed good performance in recognizing occupants\u2019 activities, was conducted. In this study, we demonstrate the performance of the three classification algorithms (SVM, KNN, and RF), which are known for effective approaches for activities prediction in the literature. A short introduction of each algorithm is provided below. RF is commonly used in building energy research owing to its simplicity and ease of use [30]. RF is an ensemble learning method that creates a multitude of decision trees whose internal node properties are evaluated and branched out accordingly to be classified as leaf nodes. The majority class per tree is then selected and the algorithm learns in the direction of decreasing uncorrelation among output variables before and after classification [31]. KNN algorithm is a method of classifying objects based on the closest training examples in the feature space [32,33]. Given the new data, the k-nearest label samples in the training dataset are found, and the given samples are assigned to the most frequent group in the k subsets. Then, new data and the k closest neighbors are found. The closeness is calculated according to the Euclidean distance measure. In other words, assuming that there are data of X 1 = ( x 11 , x 12 , ⋯ , x 1 n ) and X 2 = ( x 21 , x 22 , ⋯ , x 2 n ) , the distance between these data is defined as d i s t X 1 , X 2 = ∑ i = 1 n ( x 1 i - x 2 i ) 2 [34]. SVM was developed for classification and has been successfully applied to time series prediction, nonlinear modeling, and optimal controls problems [35,36]. SVM has been extensively utilized as a base classifier for human activity classification [37,38]. Within this new dimension, the SVM searches for the linear hyperplane that yields optimal separation (i.e., a \u201cdecision boundary\u201d separating the tuples of one class from those of another). With an appropriate non-linear mapping into a sufficiently high dimension, data from two classes can always be separated by a hyperplane. In addition, the training data in contact with the hyperplane form a so-called support vector, and the distance between hyperplanes passing through the support vector is called a margin [39]. The SVM algorithm finds the only hyperplane that geometrically maximizes the distance between two hyperplanes, that is, the margin. Once the hyperplane is determined, the kernel function is used to map the new points for classification. There are some popular kernels [40], the radial basis function (RBF) kernel of the SVM classifier is commonly used and shows a good performance. When the data set is linearly inseparable or in other words, the data set is non-linear, it is recommended to use kernel functions such as RBF. Therefore, we choose the SVC RBF kernel to implement the SVM algorithm. In this study, we use the classifiers in scikit-learn packages (i.e., \u2018RandomForestClassifier\u2019, 'KNeighborsClassifier', and 'SVC'). Scikit-learn (known as sklearn) is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language. 2.3 Validation technique The model must be validated first to evaluate the classification accuracy. Veropoulos et al. compared different model validation techniques for evaluating model accuracy and demonstrated the superior performance of cross-validation technique over hold-out and bootstrap methods despite the increased number of computations [41]. This work, therefore, employs the cross-validation technique for model validation. In the classification process, cross-validation, sometimes called rotation estimation, is a model validation technique for assessing how accurately a model will perform in practice [42]. Of the k subsets, a single subset is retained as the testing dataset, and the remaining k−1 subsets are used as a training dataset. Then, the average test error is calculated over all of the folds. The cross-validation process is repeated k times (the number of folds), with each of the k subsamples used exactly once as validation data. For example, setting k equal to 5 results in fivefold cross-validation. The value used for k in the cross-validation process in this study was 10. This method provides a reasonable estimate of the predictive accuracy of the final model trained with all of the data. Thus, it is recommended for small datasets [43]. 2.4 Evaluation The performance of a classification model can be evaluated by whether or not it achieves adequate classification according to the predefined rules. In this study, the predictive power of the occupant detection model is evaluated by using accuracy and f1-score results. Accuracy is the most intuitive performance indicator and simply indicates the percentage of accurately predicted observations concerning all of the observations [44-46]. The f1 score, another measure of the test's accuracy, is the harmonic mean of the precision and recall. When the dataset is imbalanced, f1 scores a more informative value since it considers both precision and recall measures. The formulae for these metrics are as follows: (1) Accuracy = T P + T N T P + F P + T N + F N ⋯ Where TP, TN, FP, and FN denote true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative, respectively. (2) f 1 s c o r e = 2 recall - 1 + precision - 1 ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ 3 Experiment 3.1 Experiment setup and data collection To develop an occupant detection model based on environment-related monitoring data, experiments are performed in the Smart Living Test-bed (SLT) at Dankook University, Yongin, Korea. As shown in Fig. 2 , the SLT is structured similarly to real residential space, including a kitchen, a living room, a bedroom, and a shower booth. And there are four windows(with W(2 m) × H ( 0.9 m ) ) , two in the kitchen/living room, and two in the bedroom. This test-bed is a research facility for experimental studies equipped with integrated sensing, monitoring, control technologies under various conditions. The SLT is an enclosed chamber containing various indoor environmental control devices such as a variable refrigerant flow (VRF) system, a floor heating system, a heat recovery ventilator, a humidifier, a dehumidifier, a lighting system, and appliances. Several sub-meters are installed to measure the electricity consumption of these components. The SLT includes various sensors, such as environmental sensors (i.e., temperature, humidity, CO 2 , illuminance, and sound sensors) and occupant-related sensors (i.e., PIR and door sensors). A web-based camera is also installed in the SLT to determine the occupant activity visually. The monitoring data are stored on a server using the building automation and control network (BACnet), which is an ASHRAE, ANSI, and ISO 16484\u20135 standard protocol for building automation and control systems [47]. For occupants\u2019 activity detection, a classification model was estimated using the collected input and response data, with variables selected based on the experiment. The 9-day long experiment was conducted from October 30 to November 7, 2019. The test subjects are two, both twenties. They freely enter and exit from the test-bed during the experiment and sleep in the test-bed at night according to their lifestyle. Also, various actions such as cooking, eating, cleaning, and resting are taken autonomously during their residence in a similar manner to living in a real residential environment. In other words, the subjects act autonomously according to their preference under the minimum constraint that eating and sleeping should be done in the test-bed. While residing in the test-bed, the subjects turned on and off the lighting system, humidifier, ventilation system, and heating system (i.e., heating water mat or floor heating system) according to his or her personal preferences. And appliances such as a hairdryer, television, notebook, microwave, washing machine are used without constraint during the experimental period. The monitored environmental data include the air temperature, relative humidity, PM2.5 and CO 2 concentration in bed-room/living room, outdoor temperature, PM2.5, and the energy consumption data from all heating and cooling systems, and appliances (i.e., washing machine, microwave oven, lighting, VRF, electric rice cooker, hair drier, television, hot water mat, humidifier, ventilation system, laptop) are considered to be known and measurable inputs. These 21 different data items are stored in real-time on the SLT data server. In the case of energy consumption data, each device is individually connected to a plug so that the energy consumption could be separately measured by a multi-channel power meter. And the data of the occupants\u2019 status, which would be used as the output variables of the classification model, are monitored by a web camera installed in the test-bed (see Fig. 2). Image data collected by a web camera are then transformed into numerical variables and used as model output labels. The monitored data are collected at a one-minute interval, and 9,455 observations are analyzed excluding unavailable data such as missing values or outliers. The web camera and various sensors are placed on the wall as shown in Fig. 2. Table 2 presents the main features of the monitoring sensors. 3.2 Data preprocessing In this study, data preprocessing is performed to deal with inconsistencies in the collected dataset. In particular, analysis using the classification technique requires preprocessing the data or replacing missing values with other values according to the modeling purpose. The experimental data may feature missing values due to sensor errors or malfunctions, and such missing values can decrease the performance of the developed model or yield biased results [48]. Such missing data must therefore be imputed beforehand. Data imputation methods include simple listwise deletion and replacement with alternative values. Since listwise deletion poses risks of removing important properties for data analysis, data replacement is used more commonly with mean, median, and mode as replacements or with machine learning techniques such as KNN or ANN. This study employs the KNN imputation method to process missing values. The KNN imputation predicts missing values based on their k nearest neighbors, and it is widely adopted as a simple yet highly accurate method [49]. Feature scaling is a process of adjusting data measured on different scales, whereby the data ranges are matched or the distributions are made similar to standardize the functional values [50]. Adequate normalization before training is very important in obtaining good results and can significantly reduce the calculation time [51]. In particular, normalization has been reported to be very useful in classification algorithms such as the SVM [52]. For the environmental data and the energy consumption data, data min\u2013max normalization is performed to scale the values such that they fall within a predetermined range. Using min\u2013max normalization, a value x can be transformed into x t in the new specified range [0\u20131]. (3) x t = ( x - x min ) ( x max - x min ) ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ Next, the categorical variables are directly transformed into numerical variables. Fig. 3 shows the behavioral image data of occupants being monitored through the web camera installed in the SLT. The occupant data, which are image data obtained by the web camera, needed to be converted into a suitable format, i.e., numerical data. The occupant activity is identified from the image data stored by the web camera and is classified into various activities (e.g., sleeping, resting, cooking, resting, etc.), as shown in Fig. 3. These data then are transformed into numerical variables. In this process, by directly monitoring the image data, labeling is performed manually according to the occupant activities in a one-minute time step. Imbalanced data per activity are also present since an occupant\u2019s activities are done with varying durations and frequencies. If the model is developed without addressing such imbalanced data, it may become biased to majority classes and incapable of identifying and predicting minority classes. Pre-processing of imbalanced data is thus imperative [53]. Imbalanced data processing techniques include oversampling in which the number of minority classes is matched to that of majority classes, and under-sampling where the number of majority classes is matched to that of minority classes. The common oversampling techniques include random oversampling where minority classes are randomly duplicated; Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) which interpolates minority classes to devise new data; and SMOTE + ENN method that combines SMOTE with the Edited Nearest Neighbour (ENN) technique which removes majority classes present near a minority class. Both the SMOTE and SMOTE + ENN techniques are more effective than other methods in numerous studies. This work, therefore, employed the SMOTE + ENN method to address the imbalanced data problem [53]. 4 Results 4.1 Identification of occupant activities What needs to be done before the development of a prediction model for the occupant activity is to understand the behavioral characteristics of what the occupants do in the residential environment, which this study thus first analyzed. Fig. 4 represents the result of analysis on the image data in minute increments collected by the web camera, which shows the behavior of the occupants. In Fig. 4, sleeping was accounted for 34% of overall activities, occupying the room 37% and non-occupying 29% by time. The analysis of the behavior of the occupants in more detail, while they were occupying the room, confirmed 11 different activities of working on the computer, resting, cooking, eating, exercising, taking a shower, walking, washing the dishes, cleaning, and others. As shown in Fig. 4, in the case of men and women in their 20 s, more than 58% of their time during their occupancy excluding sleeping time was spent on performing light tasks mainly on the computer, about 19% on resting watching TV and using smartphones, 6% on cooking, and another 6% on eating. Of these, the top seven activities accounted for more than 98% of all behaviors and thus sleeping, non-occupied (or away), working, resting, cooking, eating, and exercising were designated and used as model output labels. These were then transformed into numerical variables (Sleeping: 0, Resting: 1, Working: 2, Cooking: 3, Eating: 4, Exercising: 5, and Away (i.e. Non-occupied): 6), as follows. Namely, the processed occupant data were defined as a preliminary rule for the analysis of the classification algorithm to develop an occupants\u2019 activity detection model. 4.2 Statistical analysis Variable selection is a very important issue in terms of research for the development of classification models as it reduces the financial and computational costs and speeds up the machine learning processes. Therefore, an appropriate input variable must be selected through the analysis of the statistical properties of the variables. There exist many variable selection methods in the literature, such as the Random forest algorithm for ranking variables [54,55], the Spearman rank coefficient [56,57], p-value [57]. Tsanas et al. [57] considered both correlation and statistical significance of variables by using both Spearman rank coefficients and p-values for feature selection. They used the Spearman rank correlation coefficient to obtain a statistical metric regarding the association strength between each input variable and each of the two outputs and evaluated the statistical significance of this relationship using p-values. This study also applied this combined method. Using Pearson correlation coefficients, we first obtained statistical indices for the correlation strength between each input variable (environmental data and energy consumption data of appliances) and each of the seven outputs (e.g. occupants activities). Pearson correlation coefficient is known as the best method to measure the association between variables of interest because it is based on the method of covariance. In addition, it gives information about the magnitude of the association, or correlation, as well as the direction of the relationship. Namely, it lies in the range [−1 1], where a negative sign indicates an inversely proportional relationship and a positive sign proportional one. We then evaluated whether this relationship is statistically significant using p-values, and checked for significance at the 0.001 level. Table 3 presented the association strength between each variable of environmental data and equipment energy consumption data, and each occupants activity. In general, a Pearson correlation coefficient value less than 0.4 is considered a weak correlation. In this study, a variable with a correlation coefficient of 0.4 or higher was thus selected as a variable affecting the behavior of the occupants. In Table 3, the highlighted gray indicates variables with a value of 0.4 or more. According to Table 3, five environmental variables, namely PM2.5_BR, T_BR, RH_BR, CO 2 _LR, and CO 2 _BR, and four energy consumption variables, namely Lighting, TV, Hot water mat, and Laptop, correlated with the occupant status. The analysis on environmental variables per occupant activity yielded four variables correlated with Sleeping, namely PM2.5_BR, T_BR, RH_BR, and CO 2 _BR while activities such as Eating and Cooking correlated with CO 2 _LR. Four activities of Exercising, Resting, Working, and Away did not correlate with any of the environmental variables. The analysis on occupant statuses concerning the energy consumption variables showed a correlation between Sleeping and two variables of Lighting and Hot water mat. Eating and Resting correlated with TV while Working correlated with the use of a laptop. Table 4 lists the P-values computed to evaluate the statistical significance of the variables. Most variables showed statistically significant results with P-value <0.001. The P-value of CO 2 _LR was 0.128 (fail). This implies that although the correlation between Cooking and internal CO 2 concentration was verified, it can still be statistically insignificant. CO 2 _LR also affected the occupant activity of Eating and its statistical significance was verified. As a result, the variable CO 2 _LR was retained as an input variable in the development of an occupant activity prediction model. In summary, five environmental variables (PM2.5_BR, CO 2 _LR, T_BR, RH_BR, and CO 2 _BR) and four energy consumption variables (Lighting, Hot water mat, Television, and Laptop) were selected as key input variables for the occupants\u2019 activities detection model (in Table 5 ). 4.3 Evaluation of the model performance The occupants\u2019 activity classification model was developed and its performance was evaluated using the environmental and energy consumption variables selected in Table 5. To evaluate the impact and model performance with respect to input values, several input data sets were created by combining the variables from each monitored data cluster affecting the occupant activity as listed in Table 6 and Table 7 . Table 6 summarizes the mean accuracy and f1-score of the three different classification algorithms (RF, KNN, and SVM) with respect to different combinations of the five environmental variables. According to the evaluation of the RF model performance, its accuracy was found significantly low ranging from 0.2 to 0.4 when a single environmental variable was only considered. The combination of two variables, however, led to remarkably improved performance with increased accuracy of 0.8 or greater. In particular, RH_BR + CO 2 _BR resulted in an accuracy of 0.9 or greater. When three or more variables were considered, accuracy was above 0.95 while the f1-score was also above 0.9. These interesting results confirm that the results of the combinations of four variables and those of three variables do not differ significantly in terms of the accuracy of the model. This implies that the occupant activity can be accurately predicted by combining only five variables of PM2.5_BR, CO 2 _LR, T_BR, RH_BR, and CO 2 _BR. Although the highest accuracy of 99% and f1-score of 0.97 were achieved with all five variables considered, the difference in performance was deemed insignificant according to the results of this work. The KNN model featured a similar trend. Both the accuracy and f1-score evaluated for each data set were similar to those of the corresponding RF values, except for the SVM whose accuracy was relatively lower than that of RF and KNN depending on the variable combination. The combination of four variables, namely PM2.5_BR + T_BR + RH_BR + CO 2 _BR, yielded accuracy greater than 0.9. Table 7 lists the results of analysis on the accuracy and f1-score of each model according to the energy consumption variables. Unlike the results obtained with environmental data sets, RF results show a drastic performance variation when two variables are combined with accuracy ranging from 0.12 to 0.77 depending on the combination. In particular, the Lighting and Hot water mat yielded the highest accuracy of 0.77. In addition, the combination of three or more variables including Lighting and Hot water mat featured more accurate prediction performance compared to the other data sets. Such an observation implies that Lighting and Hot water mat are the two most important variables among others in predicting the occupant status. The best performance with the highest accuracy of 0.86 and f1-score of 0.5 was achieved when all four variables (Lighting, Hot water mat, Television, Laptop) were applied. Both the KNN and SVM models featured a similar trend. In summary, environmental variables made more contributions to accurate prediction for occupant activity than energy consumption variables. 4.4 Results of detection for detailed occupants activities The prediction performance of the three classification algorithms (RF, KNN, and SVM) developed detection models concerning each of the detailed seven activities considered in this work was evaluated in this section Table 8 Results of f1- score by occupants\u2019 activities applying. Table 8 lists the f1-score per occupant activity. According to the model trained with the energy consumption data sets and the RF model as a reference, Sleeping (0), Working (2), and Away (6) showed high prediction performance with f1-scores of 1, 0.82, and 0.98, respectively. In particular, Sleeping(0) and Away(6) were thus verifying the accurate identification of the two activities solely based on energy consumption variables. The accurate prediction for these two activities was due to their high correlation with the energy consumption of particular devices. Occupants behaved, for example, in a particular manner associated with each activity, such as having the lights off while asleep or away, or using electric pads and laptops while working. The prediction of the remaining activities (i.e., Cooking, Eating, Exercising, Resting) based on the energy consumption variables, however, was deemed infeasible. KNN and SVM also showed high predictive performance for Sleeping, Working, and Non-Occupation, which showed a similar trend to RF. The environmental data set-based analysis showed that both the RF and KNN models achieved an f1-score of 0.91 or greater on all seven activities. Therefore, it was confirmed that the environmental data set can detect occupant activities more effectively when compared with the energy consumption variables. The occupant activity detection model trained with both the environmental and energy consumption data sets yielded an f1-score of 0.97 or greater four out of the seven activities for both the RF and KNN, i.e., Sleeping (0), Resting (1), Working (2), and Away (6). Cooking (3) and Exercising (5) were also predicted with high accuracy of about 0.9. The SVM model, although capable of accurately predicting Sleeping (0), Working (2), Exercising (5), and Away (6) with high accuracy of 0.92 or greater using both the environmental and energy consumption data sets, failed to perform accurate prediction for the other activities, especially Cooking (3). Table 9 features a similar trend. The prediction performance was greater with environmental data sets than with energy consumption data sets, and the combination of the two further improved the performance. In addition, accurate prediction for Sleeping (0), Working (2), and Away (6) was possible with either environmental data sets or energy consumption data sets according to the evaluation of individual activities. The remaining activities were predicted with 90% or greater accuracy only when both the environmental and energy consumption variables were applied. In other words, indoor occupants used a variety of devices and their activities affected the indoor environmental conditions such as temperature, relative humidity, CO 2 concentration. As a result, the energy consumption of user devices and environmental data must be properly combined for a more effective prediction of a wide range of occupant activities. 4.5 Discussions In summary, we confirmed that applying the variables of environment and energy use made it possible to predict the seven occupant activities with an accuracy of 90% or higher. The significance of this study lies in the fact it went beyond the previous research which merely detected occupants\u2019 simple status such as presence or absence, developing a detection model based on their detailed activities. Furthermore, we were able to determine what environmental variables and energy consumption variables affected the detection model for occupant activity and then applied the results to the prediction models to identify correlations between individual variables and activities. These results were also reconfirmed by the profile analysis on the behavioral characteristics of occupants and variables of energy use and environment. Fig. 5 shows the 24-hour profiles for the variables of environment and energy consumption chosen through the feature selection and occupants activities conducted on 30 October and 4 November in 2019. It demonstrated that some of the environmental and energy-related variables selected in this study have close correlations with each of certain activities. One of the correlated activities, for example, was Away (6), which showed a negative correlation with the energy use of Lighting resulting from the occupants\u2019 behavioral pattern of turning off the lights when going away. Sleeping (0) was also found to correlate with the energy consumption of Hot water mat and CO 2 _BR concentration, which turned out to be due to the occupants\u2019 certain behavior of turning on the hot water mat for flooring heating and the continual increase in CO 2 concentration in the enclosed space during sleep. In addition, Korea, where the experiment was conducted, is geographically located in the mid-latitude temperate climate zone, so four seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter are visible. The region where the experiment was conducted has a continental climate with cold-dry winter and hot summer according to the Dwa of Köppen-Geiger climates Classification [58]. The experimental period is the month of November, and early winter is a time when the temperature difference between day and night is very large. Therefore, the test subject used a hot water mat when sleeping. Cooking (3), involving the use of the gas stove, also rapidly increased CO 2 concentrations in the living room, which immediately declined with the end of the activity. Furthermore, the energy consumption of TV grew during certain activities such as Cooking (3) and Eating (4), leading to the conclusion that the occupants usually watched TV while cooking or eating. As such, it was deemed that prediction for several activities as possible since they involved the use of certain devices or affected certain environmental variables. However, as shown in Fig. 5, any close correlations between other activities, such as Exercising (5), and certain variables were discovered During the period of Exercising (5), in particular, the activity did not correlate with any of the energy variables as light indoor stretching did not involve using any certain devices, and the environmental conditions, including temperature and humidity, remained constant without considerable changes. Nonetheless, prediction for Exercising (5) was possible with an accuracy of 90% or higher merely based on certain combinations of the variables affecting other activities, which is considered a quite interesting result. In addition, Fig. 5 demonstrates that the patterns of the selected seven activities are quite irregular with their frequency, starting/ ending time, and duration varying considerably. As such, precise prediction for detailed occupants\u2019 activities is fairly challenging since the behavioral patterns of occupants differ from person to person. Thus, subjects may behave differently in an experimental setting, resulting in different results from this study. Despite such difficulties, research on occupants\u2019 activities in actual buildings is crucial as they have effects on various control systems and energy consumption. In this sense, the results of this study which identified occupant activity based on the variables affected by their activities are expected to further contribute to a variety of control systems reflecting the activity of occupants. 5 Conclusions In this study, we proposed a non-intrusive method to classify and predict detailed activities of occupants based on environmental data and power consumption data in residential buildings. First, we identified the characteristics of occupant activity through experiments in which the occupant lives in a test-bed similar to a residential environment. According to the study, the top seven activities (sleeping, non-occupied, working, resting, cooking, eating, and exercising) accounted for more than 98% of all behaviors a day. The significance of this study was that the behavioral characteristics of the occupants were identified under conditions similar to the real residential environment and that a predictive model was developed based on the actual behavior of the occupants. These results can be used as preliminary data for operating various indoor environment control systems (lighting, air conditioning, ventilation systems, etc.) reflecting the characteristics of occupant activities. This study also employed a classification algorithm to develop an occupant activity identification model based on the variables of the building environment and energy consumption. Based on the results of occupant activity identification, a model to detect occupant activity was developed using a classification algorithm, which was a machine learning method. Three classification algorithms (i.e., the SVM, KNN, and RF algorithms) were compared and analyzed. Both activities of sleeping and away were identified accurately with variable sets of either energy consumption or environment, whereas environmental variables were needed to be able to distinguish all the occupant activities. This implies that environmental variables are more effective than energy consumption variables in identifying detailed activities of an occupant. In particular, the model accuracy slightly increased when both variable sets were combined compared to either of the sets was applied, and the best result was obtained with an average f1-score of 0.94 accuracies. In summary, the main contributions of this study include: This study found that detailed seven activities of sleeping, resting, working, cooking, eating, exercising, and away accounted for 98% of the total behavior. The significance of this study is that the behavioral characteristics were identified under conditions similar to the real residential environment. These results can therefore be used as preliminary data for a wide range of research based on the behavioral characteristics of occupants. We identified that the main variables influencing the occupant activity detection were five environmental variables (PM2.5_BR, CO 2 _LR, T_BR, RH_BR, and CO 2 _BR) and four energy consumption variables (Lighting, Hot water mat, Television, and Laptop) Environmental variables made more contribution to accurate prediction for occupant activities than energy consumption variables. The best performance of the model for the occupants\u2019 statuses was achieved by RF. Appropriate combinations of environmental variables and energy usage variables affected by the occupant activities led to fairly precise prediction with an accuracy of f1-score 0.88\u20131.0 (average 0.94). Detection for detailed activities of occupants was made possible by the development of this model, which is expected to be further used for automatic control systems based on prediction for occupant status. This study confirmed that the combination of the environmental variables, which are mainly measured inside buildings in a non-intrusive manner, resulted in more precise detection of detailed occupants\u2019 activities. These results are meaningful in that they subdivided the behavior patterns of occupants and predicted various behaviors, going beyond the simple behavior prediction model that predicted only the presence or absence of occupants indoors. The presented results are expected to contribute to the formulation of automated heating and cooling control strategies reflecting occupant activities. In practice, information on occupants\u2019 activities can be used for advanced and sophisticated thermal control systems including personal or PMV control for the HVAC system. Advanced control may consider adequate metabolic rates for correct occupants\u2019 activities to meet required thermal comfort with low energy consumption. However, the model developed in this study must be further evaluated for other seasons with more experimental data from an increased number of subjects. Even an identical individual\u2019s behavioral patterns of these seven activities, such as the frequency, starting/ ending time, and duration, may vary every day. Therefore, further studies on behavioral characteristics of occupants are required taking into consideration various factors such as occupants\u2019 characteristics, seasonal changes, and building usage.

        "dc:description": "Recently, in many existing buildings, detailed energy consumption data and various indoor/outdoor environmental data could be collected by BEMS (Building energy management system) or monitoring systems. Since the characteristics of the occupants (e.g., behavior and status) affect the indoor environment, it is possible to predict occupant information by developing an inverse model that utilizes environmental data. In this study, we proposed a method for detecting detailed occupants activities based on environmental data (e.g., temperature, relative humidity, CO 2 , concentrations, and dust concentrations) and energy consumption data (e.g., related to heating and cooling, lighting, and electronic appliances) which can be monitored in buildings. To this end, the occupants\u2019 characteristics (e.g., what the occupants do for 24 h and how often they do it) were investigated through experiments in which subjects live in a test-bed similar to a residential environment. In this study, we identified that seven specific activities of the occupants (sleeping, resting, working, cooking, eating, exercising, and away) accounted for 98% of the total behavior. Furthermore, the major environmental factors affecting the classification model were identified. The occupants' activities detection accuracy of the three classification algorithms including Random forest (RF), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), and Support vector machine (SVM) was compared and analyzed. The best performance of the model for the occupants' activities was achieved by RF. And the combination of environmental variables and energy use variables of the equipment led to improved accuracy of the average f1-score of 0.94. Detection for detailed activities of occupants was made possible by the development of a classification model using machine learning algorithms, which is expected to be further used for automatic control systems based on the prediction of occupants\u2019 activities and status.",
