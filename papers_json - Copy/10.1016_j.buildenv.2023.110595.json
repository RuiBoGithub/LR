Machine learning-based control-oriented modelling is a promising solution to model the complex system dynamics of buildings. It can benefit learning-based controllers, e.g., Model Predictive Control and Reinforcement Learning. However, obtaining reliable models is non-trivial, especially when only limited historical data generated by the baseline controller is available. This paper analyses the modelling tasks and identifies the sources of prediction error to obtain suitable machine learning models, and then proposes a training framework to provide a well-designed training procedure, mitigating the reducible errors. Six typical machine learning methods are evaluated using simulated and real-world datasets using in- and out-of-distribution data. Comprehensive evaluation metrics are also proposed. The results of absolute error and prediction interval coverage percentage indicate that purely point estimation is not enough to provide reliable predictions, and uncertainties must be quantified. Further results from analysis of the out-of-distribution data show that although some models have satisfactory predictions on in-distribution data, their capability of interpolation and extrapolation is poor. Some predictions may deviate from the targets. Point estimation may provide over-confident results. It is, therefore, essential to quantify the uncertainty caused by the lack of data to ensure that the true value falls into the prediction interval with high probability. The decomposition of the total uncertainty provides more information and detects out-of-distribution data. These investigations demonstrated the importance of accurate point estimation and uncertainty quantification for models' reliability.

This high level of consumption is primarily driven by the energy demands associated with Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems [2]. To mitigate this issue, it is essential to implement energy-efficient control technologies, which can help reduce the environmental impact of buildings. Developing an effective controller can present significant challenges, given conflicting objectives that require careful balancing, e.g., thermal comfort [3] and equipment safety [4,5]. Therefore, over the past decade, various methods based on artificial intelligence techniques, such as learning-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) [6\u20138], have been studied to optimize the balance of objectives. Nevertheless, deploying these advanced control methods is non-trivial [9]. Zhang et al. [4] investigated four DRL algorithms, including model-based and model-free. They concluded that it is hard to ensure optimality, robustness, constraint violations, and sample efficiency during online learning for all algorithms studied in the work. While MPC has shown potential in energy saving, obtaining sufficiently accurate control-oriented models is a significant factor hindering its widespread application [10]. Control-oriented models are mathematical representations of physical systems or processes designed specifically for control design and analysis. Thus, obtaining effective control-oriented models can benefit the practical deployment of the intelligent control methods because it can be used to pre-train the model-free DRL agents [11], improve the sample efficiency of model-based DRL [12], and determine the MPC's optimal control actions [6]. Unfortunately, developing such control-oriented models is challenging due to the complexity of the system and the variability of the building's thermal dynamics: first, the system is highly nonlinear as the system is affected by various factors such as weather conditions, occupancy patterns, and solar radiation [6]; second, many components in the HVAC system, such as heat exchangers, fans, and ducts, can interact in complex ways; third, the control-oriented model should be accurate enough to capture the controlled plant's system dynamics while remaining as simple as possible to make the optimization computationally efficient and numerically stable [13]. Hence, black-box modeling has attracted attention compared to the physics-based and gray-box models due to its potential to address the above problems [14,15]. Black-box approaches based on Machine Learning (ML) models are trained to learn the inherent patterns and relationships from the data with little or no physical knowledge of the system. They are relatively straightforward to implement for real-time control. Moreover, modern buildings, especially office and commercial buildings, are equipped with various sensors connected to a central Building Automation System (BAS). These sensors collect data on temperature, humidity, occupancy, light levels, power consumption, etc., making black-box modeling feasible [16]. The modeling task that is currently widely used can thus be summarized and defined as: given a building that needs to be controlled, utilize black-box methods to obtain a control-oriented model. To achieve this, it is necessary to identify the data source, the modeling purpose, and the types of ML models. There are typically three ways to obtain training data: retrieving historical operation data [17\u201319], performing actual experiments with excitation signals [20], and using high-fidelity calibrated models with excitation signals [21\u201323]. The latter two approaches require additional time and effort to conduct experiments and build models. For the second method, the excitation signals for obtaining rich training data are also limited by the constraints of the HVAC systems [10]. This limitation motivates more research on the first method since no extra effort is required to obtain additional data. As for modeling purposes, a typical control problem in buildings aims to optimize an objective function while satisfying constraints in the presence of various uncertainties. To this end, machine learning-based control-oriented models are expected to simultaneously forecast disturbance, thermal response, comfort level, and energy consumption [24]. Regarding the types of machine-learning models, researchers also tried modeling with various machine-learning methods. Kusiak et al. [17,18] utilized Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to predict energy consumption, indoor room temperature, and humidity with a dataset collected from an existing HVAC system. The input parameters include indoor/outdoor conditions and HVAC states, and the control variables include supply air temperature and supply air static pressure of the Air Handling Unit (AHU). Afroz et al. [19] tested Nonlinear Autoregressive Exogenous Neural Network (NARX-NN) on a historical dataset collected by the BAS. The impact of feature selection was studied before training the NARX-NN. Yang et al. [25] also utilized NARX-NN to learn the system dynamics model using the historical operation data. They mentioned that the collected data might not capture the building operation characteristics, downgrading the controller's performance, and a self-adaptive ML-based building model should be developed. Some works use the simulated dataset to test MLP, Support Vector Regression (SVR), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees (DT), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Auto-Regressive with External disturbance (ARX) [21\u201323,26]. Although many works have employed historical data for training machine learning-based models, the trained model may be inadequate because the data does not include a wide range of operating conditions and only contains normal operating data. Works about quantifying epistemic uncertainty caused by a lack of informative data in buildings are limited. Besides, the aleatoric uncertainty caused by the unpredictable and random nature of the physical system also needs to be quantified to ensure effective optimization and decision-making processes [27]. This paper focuses on machine learning-based control-oriented modeling tasks with historical data. The target is to obtain suitable machine-learning models for this scenario. The contributions are highlighted as follows: \u2022 By analyzing the building's thermal control characteristics, the control-oriented modeling task is formally formulated to be one step ahead and receding horizon prediction of system states and disturbances using machine learning methods. The concept and techniques of uncertainty quantification in ML are introduced to identify the possible prediction error sources, e.g., the random nature of physical systems, limited model capacity, the incompleteness of the historical dataset, and the suboptimal training procedure. We emphasize that uncertainty caused by the lack of informative data is the major challenge when modeling with historical data. \u2022 A training framework is proposed to provide a well-designed training procedure, thereby mitigating corresponding errors. Specifically, Bayesian optimization is used to do hyperparameter searches. K-fold cross-validation is used to validate the model. Early stopping is utilized to prevent over-fitting. With this training framework, six typical machine learning methods are evaluated using simulated and real-world datasets under the cases of in- and out-of-distribution data. \u2022 In the case of in-distribution data, the results of Absolute Error (AE) and Prediction Interval Coverage Percentage (PICP) are utilized to demonstrate that the proposed framework is effective in mitigating the errors caused by the training procedure. The analysis of the linear correlation coefficient indicates that the AE has a numerical relationship to the value of the targets and gives vital information to reduce errors further. The PICP is decomposed to identify the specific features with lower coverage percentages. \u2022 In the case of out-of-distribution data, the feature importance is analyzed to indicate the incompleteness of the historical dataset, followed by the investigation of the interpolation and extrapolation ability of machine learning models. The results demonstrate that point prediction may provide over-confident results for interpolation and extrapolation. In contrast, the uncertainty quantification provides an additional confidence level. Further, decomposing the total uncertainty is conducive to detecting the out-of-distribution data. \u2022 The inference time of different models, the effect of dataset quantity, and accumulative errors of applying receding horizon prediction are studied. Lastly, we propose promising research directions in the future, e.g., improving the accuracy of point prediction and uncertainty quantification. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 briefly introduces related works of system identification and machine learning. Section 3 presents the problem statement, details about the datasets, theoretic of machine learning methods, and proposed training framework. Section 4 reports experiments and results with analysis. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper with a summary of contributions. 2 Related works 2.1 Model learning and system identification \u201cModel learning\u201d and \u201csystem identification\u201d are usually used interchangeably and refer to estimating a system's dynamic behavior based on input-output measurements. The ML community uses \u201cmodel learning\u201d to emphasize machine learning methods. In contrast, the control community tends to use the word \u201csystem identification\u201d to highlight the collection of outputs for analysis and subsequent control of the system. Despite the different terminology, both communities have similar concepts and end goals. There is a growing overlap between the two fields as ML techniques are increasingly applied to control and system identification problems [28]. Model learning follows a similar procedure to that of the system identification: 1) data collection; 2) model formulation; 3) parameter estimation; and 4) model validation. In (1), to collect enough informative input-output data, the excitation signals should be well designed to stimulate the system sufficiently [29]. Additional time and effort are then needed to design experiments and collect data, both of which are not always feasible in buildings due to the long control interval and safety requirements. Due to the simplicity or ease of data collection, modeling using historical operation data has attracted researchers' attention. However, historical data without sufficient information may lead to epistemic uncertainty in the model. With this model, it is then expected to be able to quantify such uncertainties to ensure effective control and also have the online adaptation capability to evolve continuously. The selection and training of ML models corresponds to the model formulation and parameter estimation. 2.2 Disturbances prediction with machine learning The dynamic response of a building (i.e., outputs) is affected by controllable inputs and uncontrollable disturbances [30]. Disturbances are exogenous and are typically caused by thermal load, outdoor temperature, solar irradiance, occupancy, etc. They often lead to poor controller accuracy and incorrect implementation in real systems. Thus, disturbance modeling is essential to the control-oriented model because it can provide boundary conditions over the prediction horizon [24]. The performance of controllers can also be enhanced by improving the estimation of disturbances [31]. Specifically, measurable disturbances, e.g., climate conditions [32] and internal heat gains [33], can be represented as time series data, usually autocorrelated and characterized by trends and seasonal variations. Time series prediction and ML methods provide reasonable solutions for disturbance estimation [10,34]. For example, Hong et al. [35] presented an occupant behavior model to consider the discrepancies between simulated and actual heat gains. Cooling load prediction can benefit energy conservation in HVAC systems [36]. Chen et al. [37] studied the effect of weather forecasting on energy saving and indoor comfort. Amasyali et al. [38] compared the performance of ML methods in predicting the relationship between occupant behavior and energy consumption. The reviews and surveys give a detailed summary of related works [39\u201341]. 2.3 Uncertainty quantifications of machine learning The incompleteness of historical dataset leads to a distribution shift between the data retrieved from online control and the historical data. Formally, let X be the input, Y be the output of the dynamics model and P ( ∙ ) denotes corresponding distribution. Most existing ML models are trained based on the assumption that testing and training data are from the distribution P ( ∙ ) , i.e., in-distribution. However, since the historical dataset is incomplete, the test data can be out-of-distribution, denoted by P \u2032 ( ∙ ) . In the field of control-oriented modeling, the \u201cdistribution\u201d refers to \u201cinput distribution\u201d, i.e., P ( X ) ≠ P \u2032 ( X ) [42]. For these out-of-distribution data that do not satisfy the assumptions of i . i . d , ML models usually provide inaccurate predictions. Additionally, the prediction error is further exacerbated due to the limitation of model capacity and the influence of the suboptimal training procedure. Uncertainty quantification is a feasible solution to consider possible errors by providing a prediction interval [27] involving various techniques and methods specifically designed to characterize, quantify, and manage uncertainties present in mathematical models and their predictions. In the context of ML, it measures the confidence level in the model's predictions [43], considering various sources of uncertainty such as model, parameter, and dataset [44]. Aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty are two main types of uncertainty [27,45]. Existing works studied the techniques of quantifying uncertainty [46] and evaluating the quantification [47]. Sethurajan et al. [48] introduced a Bayesian approach for quantifying uncertainty in reconstructing unknown material properties of electrochemical systems from experimental data. Oneto et al. [49] reviewed several methods from statistical learning theory for the performance assessment and uncertainty quantification of predictive models for smart manufacturing systems. Specifically, it is inherently challenging to build an accurate and reliable data-driven control-oriented model of buildings. Using uncertainty quantification can provide further insight into the confidence of predictions and facilitate decision-making [50]. Despite its clear benefits, uncertainty quantification has often been overlooked in many machine learning prediction models applied to buildings. This limitation underlines the necessity for integrating uncertainty quantification in this domain, fostering the development of more robust and reliable predictive models. 2.4 Machine learning modeling frameworks The machine learning modeling procedure involves a series of steps to develop effective models for predictive tasks. For example, a typical framework may include dataset preparation, dataset processing, model generation, and model evaluation [51,52]. Such a modeling procedure provides a systematic and structured approach to developing accurate and effective predictive models. It helps ensure that the models are built on high-quality data, employ informative features, and are appropriately evaluated, optimized, and ready for deployment in real-world applications. The framework proposed by Srinivas [53] includes data pre-processing and K-fold cross-validation to build models for predicting late-arriving patients. Elshawi et al. [54] emphasized that automating the modeling process is essential to obtain satisfactory machine learning models. Automated hyperparameter tuning techniques are thus a critical component during this procedure. Feurer et al. [55] developed an improved AutoML approach integrating Bayesian hyperparameter optimization and meta-learning to increase efficiency and robustness. Other techniques, such as automatic data cleaning, automatic feature engineering, and early stopping, are also surveyed [56]. Currently, a complete training framework for the control-oriented modeling of buildings is lacking. The framework must include data processing techniques, automatic hyperparameter optimization algorithms, and comprehensive evaluation metrics to obtain the most suitable control-oriented model. 3 Methodology 3.1 Problem statement As mentioned in the introduction, the objective is to utilize machine learning-based methods to learn control-oriented models using measurable historical data. The time series dataset can be represented by D = { ( x t , u t , d t , l t ) } t = 1 N . x t ∈ X ⊂ R d x is the vector of measurable state variables. u t ∈ U ⊂ R d u is the vector of measurable control variables. d t ∈ D ⊂ R d d is the vector of measurable disturbances. Additionally, the time-related information can also benefit the predictions [57]. For example, occupants' behavior patterns and equipment utilization are highly related to the time of the day. Then, the vector l t ∈ L ⊂ R d l represents the time-rated information, e.g., time of the day, day type, etc. l t cannot be classified as x t , u t , d t , and needs to be represented separately. The dataset includes N samples arranged in time series. During the model-based decision-making process, the model may need to make multiple-step-ahead predictions within the prediction horizon. It can be achieved by either explicitly learning a model to make multiple-step-ahead predictions directly or by repeatedly making one-step-ahead predictions up to the prediction horizon. This paper focuses on the latter because the prediction horizons can be easily modified for investigation and is more suitable for integration within the framework of MPC and DRL [58]. Consider a discrete-time stochastic dynamical system, which can be represented by Eq. (1): (1) x t + 1 = f x ( x t − δ : t , u t − δ : t , d t − δ : t , l t − δ : t ) = h x ( x t − δ : t , u t − δ : t , d t − δ : t , l t − δ : t ) + ω x , t . f x : X × U × D × L → X denotes the stochastic transition function, which can be decomposed into the deterministic part h x : X × U × D × L → X and additive transition noise that represents the random nature of the physical system ω x , t ∈ R d x . δ is the length of the lookback window of four inputs. It is assumed that the dynamics f x ( ∙ ) , h x ( ∙ ) in Eq. (1) are L f x , L h x -Lipschitz continuous and the system process noise ω x , t is i . i . d . σ -sub-Gaussian and zero means. Therefore, the system dynamics can be modeled by ML methods, e.g., Gaussian Process (GP) model and Deep Neural Networks (DNN), with Lipschitz continuous non-linearities. Similar to the function of system states, consider the function of disturbances can be represented by Eq. (2) (2) d t + 1 = f d ( d t − δ : t , l t − δ : t ) = h d ( d t − δ : t , l t − δ : t ) + ω d , t . f d : D × L → D , h d : D × L → D . Let H be the prediction horizon. Suppose that the current time step is t . The prediction of x and d at timestep t + k can be represented by Eq. (3) and Eq. (4): (3) x ˆ t + k = f ˆ x ( x t + k − δ : t + k − 1 , u t + k − δ : t + k − 1 , d t + k − δ : t + k − 1 , l t + k − δ : t + k − 1 ) , (4) d ˆ t + k = f ˆ d ( d t + k − δ : t + k − 1 , l t + k − δ : t + k − 1 ) . Noted that if k − δ > 0 , x t + k − δ and d t + k − δ should be the approximated value of x ˆ t + k − δ and d ˆ t + k − δ respectively. In Eq. (1)(2), the randomness ω t creates the difference between f and h , thereby leading to the aleatoric uncertainty of the model. Besides, as shown in Fig. 1 , epistemic uncertainty occurs when approximating h [47]. Taking Eq. (1) as an example, to approximate h x , let H denote a hypothesis class H = { h x , θ : X × U × D × L → X | θ ∈ Θ } , where θ is parameter, e.g., the model parameters of DNN. H is contained in F , which includes all functions that map X × U × D × L → X . It is assured that h x ∈ F . Due to the limited capacity of the hypothesis class H , it is possible that h x ∉ H , thereby creating the discrepancy between h x and h x , θ * , where h x , θ * is the best function within the hypothesis space. The uncertainty due to such a discrepancy is called model uncertainty. Second, for a specific hypothesis space H , if the dataset contains sufficient information about the system dynamics, the learning task is to find the h x , θ * within H using proper training procedures. However, if the samples inside the dataset are historical operation data, the dataset typically only includes finite samples with limited information. Hence, it is not easy to induce the actual system dynamics from such datasets, thereby creating the difference between h x , θ ˆ * and h x , θ * . This difference will cause data uncertainty [59]. Lastly, it should be noted that designing a proper training procedure is non-trivial. A specific ML model's performance is affected by many factors, e.g., initialization of model parameters, selection of algorithm hyperparameters, underfitting, overfitting, etc. Such factors amplify the error between h x , θ ˆ * and h x , θ ˆ , leading to procedural uncertainty. Usually, for ML models where the hypothesis space is sufficiently large, it can be assumed that h x ∈ H , and the model uncertainty is negligible. Thus, this paper will not consider the model uncertainty. The data uncertainty can also be neglected if the training and testing datasets samples are from the same distribution. Thus, a satisfactory function h x , θ ˆ can be obtained if a rigorous training procedure is applied. In practice, the training procedure can be improved by utilizing corresponding techniques, such as hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation. However, data uncertainty is usually hard to ignore if the testing and training data are from different distributions. This is an especially significant challenge when modeling with historical data. 3.2 Machine learning models This section will discuss possible machine learning-related models in H . There are many advantages to using ML for control-oriented modeling. For example, it can handle complex nonlinear dynamic systems more flexibly and adapt to system dynamics changes over time. The accuracy is also higher than traditional methods, particularly for complex and nonlinear systems. Ala'raj et al. [60] reviewed commonly used ML models in HVAC optimization, e.g., KNN, RF, MLP, LSTM, etc. However, these models typically only provide single-point predictions of f ˆ x and f ˆ d with over-confidence in their results. To this end, this paper further tests two deep learning methods that can quantify uncertainties: BNN and PENN. The following will briefly discuss the unique properties of these methods. KNN is a non-parametric method for classification or regression tasks [61]. It stores all available samples in the training dataset and predicts the targets in the testing dataset based on a similarity measure, e.g., Euclidean distance and Manhattan distance. The target is then calculated based on its k neighbors according to a voting method, e.g., average or distance weighting. Therefore, the critical elements of KNN are the value of k , the similarity measure, and the voting method, which can be regarded as hyperparameters that need to be tuned. RF is a typical ensemble learning method with regression trees as the base learner. RF introduces randomness into the node splitting, i.e., the standard tree split node uses the best split among all features, while the RF split node uses the best among a subset of features randomly chosen at that node [62]. RF is believed to be robust against overfitting. The hyperparameters that need to be tuned include the number of trees, the maximum depth of the tree, the number of features to consider when looking for the best split, etc. MLP is a fully connected feedforward DNN commonly used in classification and regression tasks. The number of hidden layers and neurons in each layer, the activation function and optimizer type, and the learning rate are tuneable hyperparameters. The model parameters will be trained by backpropagation according to a specific cost function, e.g., Mean Square Error (MSE). LSTM is a typical model of Recurrent Neural Networks [63], which can capture the information from previous timesteps, so it is suitable to model the time series data. The typical units of LSTM include a memory cell, an input gate to control the addition of new information to the cell, a forget gate to determine what information to discard from a previous state, and an output gate that controls the state output of the cell. The tuneable hyperparameters include hidden layers, neurons in each layer, learning rate, etc. These four machine-learning models have been widely used in building-related modeling tasks. The readers are suggested to refer to related works for model details. However, aleatoric uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty, which affect the decision-making process's performance, are typically ignored by KNN, RF, MLP, and LSTM models [27]. As a result, the controller may select infeasible actions which may violate the safety constraints [64]. Bayesian approximation (e.g., BNN) and ensemble learning techniques (e.g., PENN) are widely used uncertainty quantification approaches. Presently, works about modelling the system dynamics of buildings using BNN and PENN are still limited. Ensemble methods aim to train multiple models to produce numerous predictions [65]. The final output can be induced from the combined predictions. Specifically, PENN is composed of N DNNs similar in structure to MLP. The output layer of each MLP parameterizes a probability distribution function N ( μ θ ˆ n , σ θ ˆ n 2 ) to capture aleatoric uncertainty caused by ω x , t or ω d , t . Then, the final prediction can be estimated by taking the mean and variation of the point prediction of all base models. As indicated by Eq. (5), μ c θ ˆ is the average of means of all base models, and h θ ˆ = μ c θ ˆ . The corresponding total epistemic uncertainty can be quantified by σ E U θ ˆ 2 , which is calculated by Eq. (6). The corresponding aleatoric uncertainty is quantified by σ A U θ ˆ 2 , as denoted by Eq. (7). Finally, the total uncertainty, including epistemic uncertainty and aleatoric uncertainty, can be approximated by σ c θ ˆ 2 , indicated by Eq. (8). To train the PENN, the loss function can be calculated using negative log prediction probability, denoted by Eq. (9). y n is the target value in the dataset, e.g., x t + 1 and d t + 1 . The hyperparameters of PENN include learning rate, the number, and structure of base models, etc. (5) μ c θ ˆ = 1 N ∑ n = 1 N μ θ ˆ n , (6) σ E U θ ˆ 2 = 1 N − 1 ∑ n = 1 N ( μ θ ˆ n − μ c θ ˆ ) 2 , (7) σ A U θ ˆ 2 = 1 N ∑ n = 1 N σ θ ˆ n 2 , (8) σ c θ ˆ 2 = σ A U θ ˆ 2 + σ E U θ ˆ 2 , (9) L o s s = ∑ n = 1 N [ μ c θ ˆ , n − y n ] T ∑ θ ˆ , n − 1 [ μ c θ ˆ , n − y n ] + log det ∑ θ ˆ , n . Unlike PENN, BNN places a distribution, e.g., Gaussian distribution, over the model parameters, and the goal is to train these distributions conditional on the information in the training data [66,67]. θ ˆ ∼ p ( θ ˆ | D ) , where θ ˆ is the model parameters and D is the dataset. p ( θ ˆ | D ) is the posterior distribution. Typically, the calculation of the posterior distribution is intractable. Therefore, a distribution q φ ( θ ˆ | D ) can be used to approximate the p ( θ ˆ | D ) , where φ is the set of parameters of the distribution q φ ( θ ˆ | D ) . Therefore, the training target is to minimize the distance, e.g., Kullback\u2013Leibler (KL) divergence, between distributions, as denoted by Eq. (10) (10) K L ( q φ ( θ ˆ | D ) \u2016 p ( θ ˆ | D ) ) = log p ( D ) − ∫ q φ ( θ ˆ | D ) log p ( θ ˆ , D ) q φ ( θ ˆ | D ) d φ . The first term on the right side of the equation is \u201cEvidence,\u201d and the second is Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO). Since the \u201cEvidence\u201d can be assumed to be a constant, the training target is transformed into maximizing ELBO. By further derivation, ELBO can be represented by Eq. (11) (11) E L B O = E q φ ( θ ˆ | D ) log p ( D | θ ˆ ) − K L ( q φ ( θ ˆ | D ) \u2016 p ( θ ˆ ) ) , where p ( θ ˆ ) is the prior distribution of model parameters. The ELBO can be approximated by Monte Carlo sampling. In this paper, the output of BNN is the target value y , e.g., the state x or disturbance d . When making a prediction, the model parameters θ will be sampled N times according to the training distributions and output N predictions y θ ˆ , n , n = 0,1 \u2026 , N . Then, the final output of BNN and associated uncertainty can be calculated by Eq. (12) and Eq. (13), respectively. Compared with PENN, BNN directly calculates the total uncertainty without decomposing it into aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. It is essential to acknowledge that various types of BNN models exist. Specific BNN models are designed to handle uncertainty decomposition as well. This study's primary objective was to compare the approaches of uncertainty decomposition and non-decomposition by utilizing two ML models with uncertainty quantification capabilities. Therefore, a type of BNN model that cannot decompose uncertainty is selected. The hyperparameters of BNN include learning rate, structures of neural networks, etc. (12) μ c θ ˆ = 1 N ∑ n = 1 N y θ ˆ , n , (13) σ c θ ˆ 2 = 1 N − 1 ∑ n = 1 N ( μ c θ ˆ − y θ ˆ , n ) 2 . In this paper, models' hyperparameters include model-specific and general \u201chyperparameters,\u201d e.g., data normalization methods and the length of lookback windows. According to the evaluations of Zhang et al. [4], we investigated two normalization cases: non-normalization and Min-Max normalization. 3.3 Training framework A well-designed training procedure should be developed for a fixed dataset to mitigate procedural uncertainty. Based on this, the trained model h θ ˆ can be considered the closest function to h of a specific ML method. Suboptimal training procedures create the error between h θ ˆ * ( x ) and h θ ˆ ( x ) . The error is reducible by utilizing corresponding techniques during the model learning procedure, e.g., early stopping, dropout, cross-validation, Bayesian optimization-based hyperparameter tuning, etc. Therefore, the framework in Fig. 2 is proposed to train the models, conduct models\u2019 evaluation, and select the most suitable model. First, the time series data are collected and stored in the dataset. Second, the raw dataset should be processed before training. For example, data cleaning identifies the data gaps and outliers to generate a clean version of the dataset. Techniques like linear interpolation, KNN, and matrix factorization can fill the data gaps [68,69]. Linear interpolation can also be used to modify the outliers. After that, feature selection methods can be utilized to achieve data dimensional reduction, which is good for finding more efficient and accurate models, e.g., filters, wrappers, embedded, and hybrid methods [70]. The effect of feature selection has been studied in some thermal load prediction or building energy modeling works [71,72]. The processed dataset should be split into the training and testing datasets to mitigate overfitting, according to a specific split ratio, e.g., 80% and 20% [73] (The training dataset will be further split into two parts: training and validation dataset when doing cross-validation in the next step). Image 1 Third, obtaining the optimal model of a specific machine-learning method is a complex and time-consuming process involving algorithm selection and hyperparameter tuning. Among these, hyperparameter tuning is essential. Generally, the type of hyperparameters can be classified as continuous (e.g., learning rate), discrete (e.g., the number of neural network's hidden layers and neuron numbers), and categorical (e.g., type of optimizers) [74]. Manual hyperparameter tuning is ineffective and tedious. To this end, Hyperparameter Optimization methods are proposed to automate the hyperparameter tuning process. Compared to the grid and random search, Bayesian optimization can determine the next hyperparameter value based on previous results, thereby detecting the optimal hyperparameter combination within fewer iterations [75]. In addition, to estimate the generalization performance of a specific hyperparameter combination, K-fold cross-validation should be employed [76]. Early stopping is also used to prevent overfitting [77]. The best hyperparameter combination can thus be searched for a specific machine-learning model. Fourth, the trained models (using the best hyperparameter combination and the testing dataset) of all ML methods should be compared based on metrics to select the most appropriate model. Commonly used metrics are MSE, MAE, Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and R 2 represented by Eq. (14)-Eq. (17) respectively: (14) M S E = 1 n ∑ i = 1 n ( y ˆ i − y i ) 2 , (15) M A E = 1 n ∑ i = 1 n | y ˆ i − y i | , (16) M A P E = 1 n ∑ i = 1 n | y ˆ i − y i y i | , (17) R 2 = 1 − ∑ i = 1 n ( y ˆ i − y i ) 2 ∑ i = 1 n ( y ˆ i − y \u203e ) 2 . However, since accuracy is not the only factor in revealing model performance, other metrics should also be used to evaluate models. According to the requirement of model-based control approaches, e.g., MPC and model-based DRL, a reliable dynamics model is necessary to provide safety guarantees. Reliable typically means that within the operation region, for a given input x i , the model can provide trustable estimations of the prediction and uncertainty. If the model can quantify uncertainty, a prediction interval about the prediction can be constructed so that the ground truth values are expected to be contained in the prediction interval with high probability. PICP can be used to test the estimated interval, as indicated by Eq. (18) (18) P I C P = 100 % M ∑ m = 1 M 1 y m ∈ [ L m , U m ] , where m = 1,2 , \u2026 M is the number of testing samples, L m and U m is the lower and upper bound of the prediction interval, respectively. L m and U m can be calculated by Eq. (19) and Eq. (20), respectively. Typically, for example, if β m = 2 , it is expected that P I C P ≈ 95 % . If the P I C P < 95 % , it means that the model may underestimate the uncertainty. (19) L m = μ c θ ˆ , m − β m σ c θ ˆ , m (20) U m = μ c θ ˆ , m + β m σ c θ ˆ , m The interpolation and extrapolation capabilities, the inference time to make predictions, and the cumulative errors of receding horizon predictions can also show the properties of ML models. The pseudocode of the algorithm framework is shown in Algorithm 1. 3.4 Datasets As illustrated by Fig. 3 , the datasets of three buildings with various areas, scales, structures, and HVAC systems are used to investigate the ML models. The first building (Fig. 3(a)) is an EnergyPlus-simulated Data Center building [78] named EP. This two-zone data center model has different cooling systems for each zone. The dimension of the west zone is 15.25 m × 15.24 m × 4.572 m , while the east zone is 17 m × 15.24 m × 4.572 m . Information Technology Equipment (ITE) is organized in racks inside the room, and all racks are structured into several rows. The cooling systems for both zones include mixing boxes, Variable Air Volume (VAV) fans, Direct Evaporative Coolers (DEC), and Indirect Evaporative Coolers (IEC). Differently, the west zone cools the air using Direct Expansion (DX) units, and the east zone cools the air using Chillers supported by Chilled-Water Cooling Coils (CW-CC), pumps, and cooling towers. One year of historical data with a sample time of 15 min, i.e., 35040 samples, is collected under normal operation. The features are shown in Table 1 . The second building (Fig. 3(b)) is a real-world medium-sized office building inside the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory campus in Berkeley, California. The building is divided into 57 thermal zones. The HVAC system utilized four rooftop units with water-cooled DX coils to provide cooled air to the underfloor plenums. The dataset, Building59, is collected from 2018-09-15 10:00:00 to 2019-12-19 10:00:00 and processed into a sample time of 15 min. Therefore, there are 45122 samples. The features are shown in Table 1. Detailed information about this dataset is suggested to refer to Ref. [79]. The samples of EP or Building59 are generated using the default controller. Hence, their training and testing datasets can be considered to be from the same distribution, making them unsuitable for testing the performance of models on out-of-distribution data. To this end, we create the third building's dataset using the calibrated gray-box model of the experimental test cell Armadillo Box [80], as illustrated in Fig. 3(c). This building has one zone, and a \u201c3 in 1\u201d heat pump performs the heating and cooling. The deterministic and discrete Resistor-Capacitor (RC) model in Eq. (21) and Eq. (22) can be calibrated using the collected historical data (21) T i , t + 1 = T i , t + d t C i ( 1 R i ( T e , t − T i , t ) + Φ h , t + A i Φ s , t ) (22) T e , t + 1 = T e , t + d t C e ( 1 R i ( T i , t − T e , t ) + 1 R e ( T o , t − T e , t ) + A e Φ s , t ) . T i , T e and T o are the indoor, envelope, and outdoor temperatures. Φ h and Φ s are the indoor heating power and global horizontal solar irradiance. R i and R e are the thermal resistance between the indoor air temperature and the envelope and between the envelope and the ambient air. C i and C e are the heat capacitances of the interior and the envelope. A i and A e are the solar gain coefficients of the interior and the envelope. The states of the system include T i , T e . The actions include Φ h . The disturbances include T o and Φ s . The model parameters that need to be identified are C i , C e , A e and A i . Suppose that the current time step is t 0 , the disturbances and states on the right-hand side of Eq. (21) are fixed. The control variable Φ h , t 0 can be changed to generate the corresponding room temperature T i , t 0 + 1 . Assuming the function between Φ h , t 0 and T i , t 0 + 1 is Eq. (23) (23) T i , t 0 + 1 = f R C ( Φ h , t 0 ) = h R C ( Φ h , t 0 ) + ω R C , t 0 , where f R C is the stochastic function, h R C is the deterministic part of f R C (i.e., Eq. (21)), ω R C , t 0 is the randomness of the system and ω R C , t 0 ∼ N ( 0,0.25 ) . The range of Φ h , t 0 is 0\u20138000 W and is uniformly discretized into 1000 data points Φ h , t 0 , i with an interval of 8 W to generate 1000 corresponding outputs T i , t 0 + 1 , i . The dataset can be represented by D = { ( Φ h , t 0 , i , T i , t 0 + 1 , i ) } i = 1 1000 . To test the extrapolation and interpolation, the dataset is split into five parts according to Φ h , t 0 . 1600\u20133200 W and 4800\u20136400 W are used to train the models. 0\u20131600 W and 6400\u20138000 W are used to test the extrapolation capability of the models. 4800\u20136400 W is used to test the interpolation capability of the models. 4 Results and discussions The models are first evaluated on the in-distribution datasets, e.g., EP and Building59. The point predictions are compared using AE and linear correlation coefficient. After that, prediction intervals and PICP are analyzed. Following this, the performance of out-of-distribution data is studied. The accumulative error of receding horizon prediction and inference time are compared. 4.1 Absolute errors The best-searched hyperparameters using the training dataset are used to train models using the testing dataset. Then, the AE of the trained models between the ground truth and the prediction is shown in Fig. 4 . For BNN and PENN, μ c θ ˆ is used to calculate the AE. From Fig. 1, it can be seen that the system's randomness, the limitation of the ML model, the limited data information, and the training procedure causes the difference between the ground truth and point prediction. With the assumption that model capacity is enough and the samples are from the same distribution, it can be deduced that the differences between the AE of models are highly likely due to the training procedure and the randomness of the system. KNN and BNN show less competitive performance regarding AE for both datasets. It can be due to the suboptimal algorithm or insufficient hyperparameter space. The performance of the other four models is similar, and none of the models can outperform the other models in all features. For Building59, PENN shows narrower AE boxes in most features. It may be because PENN averages the predictions of multiple base models according to Eq. (5), thereby reducing the bias. Comparing the performance of the same model on similar features in different datasets, models show minor AE in EP than in Building59, e.g., Fig. 4(a)(i), Fig. 4(b)(k), Fig. 4(d)(o), and Fig. 4(e)(p). There may be several reasons: 1) Building 59 has a larger building scale and a larger number of features, so the true function to be approximated is more complex; 2) EP is a simulated dataset, and the randomness of the system is slight, and there is no measurement noise. In general, for a fixed dataset, the performance of most models is close, meaning that the proposed framework is effective to a certain extent, i.e., h θ ˆ ≈ h θ ˆ * . 4.2 Correlations between the predictions and targets A reliable model needs to provide accurate point predictions. The results in Section 4.1 shows that residual errors may still exist even with a well-designed training procedure. However, the AE distribution cannot establish AE's numerical relationship to the target value. In this section, the correlation analysis method is used to numerically analyze the results of point prediction, aiming to evaluate the prediction of specific features and the relationship between AE and the numerical value of the targets. It will provide vital information for further reducing the error. Fig. 5 depicts the correlation between the ground truth and the predictions of PENN with best-searched hyperparameters. Overall, all features illustrate a remarkable linear relationship between each other. Most R 2 values are higher than 0.95. However, the predicted values of some features exhibit significant deviations from the true values, e.g., Fig. 5(d)(o)(p). In Fig. 5(d)(o), the predictions of HVAC electricity usage show unsatisfactory R 2 . From the scatter plot and marginal distribution, it can be seen that many points deviate from the line y = x . Deviations have a notable numerical correlation with the true value. Many true values close to zero correspond to more significant deviations. This will lead to huge MAPE outliers, which is not conducive to analyzing the controller's energy-saving performance. One reason may be that there is insufficient information on the HVAC system in the current datasets. Therefore, further improvement of the prediction accuracy of HVAC energy consumption is necessary. Future research can be conducted to reduce this error by adding more information, e.g., the detailed status of equipment in the HVAC system. Some other features also produce notable outliers, but these points are not connected to the value of targets, e.g., Fig. 5(l)(n). This may be related to the higher randomness of the environment or the system. 4.3 Predicted data trajectories In Section 4.1 and Section 4.2, the errors of the point estimation have been analyzed. The training framework is proposed to reduce the error caused by the suboptimal training procedure. However, in practice, an optimal training procedure is always challenging to obtain. Additionally, due to the randomness of the system and insufficient data, errors may still exist and thus creating uncertainties. For this reason, it is difficult to reduce the AE in Fig. 4 further. Point estimation methods, e.g., KNN, RF, MLP, and LSTM, can only provide a deterministic prediction, often over-confident in their results and ignoring possible existing errors. This may degrade the performance of the controller and even causes safety issues. In contrast, models with uncertainty quantification capabilities, e.g., BNN and PENN, can consider the residual errors by constructing prediction intervals. Eq. (19)(20) can be used to calculate the prediction interval. A reliable model typically means that the true values fall into this prediction interval with high probability. PICP in Eq. (18) can thus be used to evaluate the model's reliability. Fig. 4 shows the distribution of AE but not the details, such as prediction intervals. Thus, a period of curves of predicted states and disturbances is shown in Fig. 6 to provide an intuitive depiction of the difference between the predictions and ground truth. Overall, all models can generally predict the change patterns of features. Point estimation may suddenly deviate from the actual value, seen in LSTM in Fig. 6(i) and KNN in Fig. 6(o), which is undesirable. BNN and PENN provide prediction intervals represented by shaded areas with β m = 2 . However, the prediction of BNN exhibits large deviations. The difference between h θ ˆ and h θ ˆ * may contribute to such errors, meaning that the algorithms may be suboptimal or the hyperparameter space may be insufficient. Additionally, although BNN can quantify the total uncertainty, prediction intervals that are too large indicate a significant bias and are also undesirable, e.g., Fig. 6(d). Intuitively, PENN exhibits minor deviations, with most ground truth falling into the prediction interval. Table 2 shows the results of PICP. BNN provides satisfactory PICP only when predicting disturbances in EP with β m = 3 . PENN shows higher PICP in EP. However, the PICP when predicting states in Building59 is lower. It should be noted that when calculating PICP using Eq. (18), it requires that all features of a sample should be within the prediction interval. Assume that the features are independent, the probability that a sample is counted as \u201c1\u201d is denoted by Eq. (24) (24) P ( y m ∈ [ L m , U m ] ) = ∏ i = 1 N P ( y m , i ∈ [ L m , i , U m , i ] ) , where m denotes a specific sample, and i is the feature of the sample, P ( y m , i ∈ [ L m , i , U m , i ] ) ≤ 1 . Therefore, high-dimensional features will reduce the probability of y m ∈ [ L m , U m ] . If the prediction of the prediction interval for one of the features is inaccurate, it will affect the final PICP. The dimension of the states in Building59 is 69, which is much higher than in other cases. To study the details, Eq. (25) is proposed to calculate the PICP of each feature, i.e., P I C P _ F . (25) P I C P _ F = 100 % M ∑ m = 1 M 1 y m , i ∈ [ L m , i , U m , i ] . The distribution of P I C P _ F with β m = 2 is shown in Fig. 7 . BNN and PENN can provide high P I C P _ F for most of the features in EP. However, BNN shows an outlier when predicting states, which may explain why the PICP in Table 2 is only 39.95%. For Building59, BNN displays lower P I C P _ F generally. This means that the BNN underestimates the total uncertainty. In contrast, PENN can still maintain a high P I C P _ F for most features. However, the outliers decrease the final PICP in Table 2. When predicting states in Building59, the PICP is only 1.98%, while Fig. 7(b) indicates that most P I C P _ F is satisfactory. P I C P _ F points out the specific feature that affects PICP by decomposing it. Future works can further study this issue and improve the PICP of models in high-dimensional tasks. 4.4 Out-of-distribution data The datasets of EP or Building59 are generated using the baseline controller. Thus, the training and testing datasets can be considered to be from the same distribution, meaning that their features have similar statistical characteristics, e.g., mean and variance. However, historical datasets are usually incomplete and lack critical information about the system. Given that MPC and DRL may need to explore the action space to search for better action, the concatenated input for prediction may be out of the training distribution, i.e., out-of-distribution data. The previous sections discussed the performance of the models on in-distribution data. This section will identify the impacts of out-of-distribution data on the model's performance. First, the incompleteness of historical data should be demonstrated. RF is used to analyze the feature importance of Building59's one-step-ahead state prediction, as shown in Fig. 8 (a). It can be observed that the power consumption of HVAC has a very high importance. However, the importance of control variables is worth studying for control problems that need to explore the action spaces. The histogram of RTU supply air temperature and heating water temperature in Building59 is illustrated in Fig. 8(b)(c). It can be seen that some values of a specific control variable have rarely or never been executed. When exploring new actions, lacking this critical information may make the model's predictions on unseen data unreliable. Even worse, it should be noted that the space of the input is X × U × D × L . The absence of data in each dimension will lead to incompleteness. Therefore, the actual incompleteness of the training dataset is far greater than shown in Fig. 8(b)(c). The model is expected to provide satisfactory predictions with uncertainty quantifications on out-of-distribution data. The third dataset generated by Armadillo is used to test the models. The results are shown in Fig. 8(d)-(f). Fig. 8(d) shows the point estimations of KNN, RF, MLP, and PENN. Even though KNN and RF can learn the patterns of the testing dataset, as shown in Fig. 8(d), they failed to interpolate and extrapolate the data of Armadillo. LSTM and MLP have certain extrapolation and extrapolation capabilities. However, they cannot quantify the model's aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty and hence may provide over-confident results. Their predictions can be seen to have deviated from the targets. In Fig. 8(e), BNN generates multiple prediction curves by sampling model parameters. It is able to interpolate the data of \u201cTest2\u201d in the figure. However, the BNN model used in this paper cannot decompose the total uncertainty. The uncertainty in Fig. 8(e) thus includes aleatoric uncertainty, model uncertainty, data uncertainty, and procedural uncertainty. Therefore, the total uncertainty cannot clearly reflect the data uncertainty caused by out-of-distribution data. In addition, its extrapolation capability is not satisfactory. The curves cannot cover the true value, meaning that the uncertainty quantification is also not accurate enough. In contrast, PENN in Fig. 8(f) provides more helpful information. The shaded area shows the prediction interval of aleatoric uncertainty. It can be observed that the prediction intervals can cover the randomness. With the assumption that PENN has enough model capability and the training procedure is well-designed, the model and procedural uncertainty can be ignored. Hence, the data uncertainty dominates the epistemic uncertainty in Fig. 8(f). This can thus reflect the lack of informative data and detect out-of-distribution data. Even though the extrapolation of PENN does not outperform others, PENN provides satisfactory uncertainty quantification and hence the PICP is still high. 4.5 Inference time and dataset size As control-oriented models, the inference time for making predictions is essential. The controllers, e.g., MPC and DRL, are usually used in real-time control systems, where decisions should be made quickly and accurately. If the inference time for making predictions is too long, it may not be able to fulfil the real-time requirements of the system. For example, slow predictions render the control input to be outdated, leading to instability and other undesirable behavior in the system. Slow inference time may also indicate a heavy burden on computational resources. Therefore, lower inference time is usually preferred. Fig. 9 (a)(b) illustrates the inference time of the trained models. BNN needs to average over multi-predictions and sample model parameters at each prediction, which increases computation time. In contrast, MLP and LSTM do not need this process and are therefore faster. PENN does not require sampling model parameters. However, due to the structural characteristics of the ensemble model, the number of model parameters may be amplified, thereby increasing the inference time linearly. The inference time of RF is related to the tree ensemble size, the complexity of the trees, and the number of features, i.e., the results of the hyperparameter search. Therefore, the calculation time of different RF structures may vary significantly, as shown in Fig. 9. The inference time of KNN is related to the dimensionality of the data and the calculation of distance between data points. Since the number of neighbors used to infer the prediction and the method of calculating distance are tuneable hyperparameters, the inference time may be affected drastically. In general, for systems with slow dynamic changes (e.g., the temperature in a room may generally take tens of minutes or even hours to reach a stable value), the influence of inference time indicated by Fig. 9 can be ignored. Shorter inference times are recommended for systems or plants with fast dynamic changes (e.g., supply fans and chillers), such as neural network-based MLP, LSTM, and PENN. The relationship between the dataset size and the prediction accuracy is not always straightforward. A larger dataset can improve the accuracy, as the model has more data to learn from and can capture more complex patterns in the data, potentially resulting in higher accuracy on the testing dataset. At the same time, overestimating the generalizability of larger datasets may also lead to overfitting and when tested with new data, results in lower accuracy on the testing dataset. The following Fig. 9(c) shows the effect of the dataset size of Building59 on the MSE of state prediction for multiple model types. The ratio of the samples used for training to the total samples in the training dataset were varied from 0.2 to 1.0. It can be observed that generally, the effect of increasing the dataset size on MSE reduction is not linear but decays gradually. There was a slight increase in MSE when increasing the dataset size from 0.8 to 1.0, particularly for KNN, LSTM and PENN. Therefore, our attention should not be solely directed towards the quantity of the dataset; rather, a thorough examination of the dataset's quality is also imperative. 4.6 Accumulative error of receding horizon prediction The prediction horizon determines the length of the future predictions used in the control optimization process. Longer prediction horizons provide more information about the future and more significant errors and/or deviations from the desired behavior. Therefore, the optimal prediction horizon length is usually a compromise between computational efficiency and control performance. The results of using EP and Building59 are shown in Fig. 10 . It should be noted that the MSE between EP and Building59 is not comparable due to the inherent difference in their various types of states. All models show higher MSE when increasing the horizon due to the accumulation of errors. For a five-step ahead prediction, the MSE can even increase around five-fold. This result is not favorable for MPC and DRL. MPC needs to predict several time steps to choose the best trajectory and then select the best action of the current time step. DRL needs to calculate the cumulative reward through the predicted trajectory. The accumulation of errors will lead to a more significant difference between the predicted and actual trajectories, thereby leading to the inaccurate selection of control actions. Therefore, further work should be done to decrease the deviations. 5 Conclusion Combining machine learning-based and control-oriented modelling is a promising solution to model the complex system dynamics of buildings. However, obtaining reliable and practical models is non-trivial, especially when only limited historical data generated by the baseline controller is available. To this end, this paper emphasizes that accuracy is not the only factor in revealing model performance in engineering practice. The models should be evaluated from multiple perspectives, e.g., MSE, MAE, PICP, uncertainty quantification, inference time, performance on out-of-distribution data, accumulative error, etc. This way, models that are suitable for control scenarios can be developed. The modelling task is the receding horizon prediction of stochastic discrete-time system disturbances and states. This paper identifies prediction error sources as the physical system's random nature, limited model capacity, insufficient data information, and suboptimal training procedures. Thus, a training framework including techniques like early stopping, cross-validation, and Bayesian optimization-based hyperparameter tuning is proposed to provide a well-designed training procedure. Based on this, six machine learning methods are evaluated using both simulated and real-world collected datasets. The analyses on absolute errors indicate that most machine learning methods provide similarly satisfactory results, meaning that the proposed framework is effective. However, removing the residual errors is challenging due to the limited samples and the random nature of the physical system. KNN, RF, MLP, and LSTM can only provide point estimation with over-confidence and fail to consider the remaining errors. In contrast, methods with uncertainty quantification (e.g., BNN and PENN) can provide additional prediction intervals to improve the model's reliability. The predicted trajectory and PICP analyses indicate that PENN outperforms BNN, and true values will fall within the predicted prediction interval with high probability. Therefore, a reliable model should provide both satisfactory point predictions and uncertainty quantification. The controller may need to explore the action space to search for better control variables and therefore encounter the out-of-distribution data. Hence, the model's performance on in- and out-of-distribution data should be demonstrated. The results show that KNN and RF have unsatisfactory interpolation and extrapolation capabilities. LSTM and MLP provide point estimation without considering uncertainty. The BNN model used in this paper cannot decompose the total uncertainty and detect the out-of-distribution data. In contrast, PENN outperforms others because it provides satisfactory uncertainty quantification, higher PICP, and detections of out-of-distribution data. The investigations also indicate the limitations of existing machine-learning methods. First, the cumulative errors of receding horizon predictions of all methods can not be ignored. This limitation is not good for prediction-based controllers, e.g., MPC and DRL. The PICP of high-dimensional tasks should be improved. Some features, such as HVAC power consumption, show significant deviations from the target value. Future research can be conducted to reduce this error by considering more information. It is necessary to improve point predictions' accuracy and uncertainty quantification to improve the models\u2019 reliability and practicability. Works related to improving the performance of BNN and PENN deserve more notice because of their ability to quantify uncertainty. The results in this paper provide insights for future research in advanced control toward energy-efficient buildings.

        "dc:description": "Machine learning-based control-oriented modelling is a promising solution to model the complex system dynamics of buildings. It can benefit learning-based controllers, e.g., Model Predictive Control and Reinforcement Learning. However, obtaining reliable models is non-trivial, especially when only limited historical data generated by the baseline controller is available. This paper analyses the modelling tasks and identifies the sources of prediction error to obtain suitable machine learning models, and then proposes a training framework to provide a well-designed training procedure, mitigating the reducible errors. Six typical machine learning methods are evaluated using simulated and real-world datasets using in- and out-of-distribution data. Comprehensive evaluation metrics are also proposed. The results of absolute error and prediction interval coverage percentage indicate that purely point estimation is not enough to provide reliable predictions, and uncertainties must be quantified. Further results from analysis of the out-of-distribution data show that although some models have satisfactory predictions on in-distribution data, their capability of interpolation and extrapolation is poor. Some predictions may deviate from the targets. Point estimation may provide over-confident results. It is, therefore, essential to quantify the uncertainty caused by the lack of data to ensure that the true value falls into the prediction interval with high probability. The decomposition of the total uncertainty provides more information and detects out-of-distribution data. These investigations demonstrated the importance of accurate point estimation and uncertainty quantification for models' reliability.",
