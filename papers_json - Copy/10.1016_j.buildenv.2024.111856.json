Department of Building Environment and Energy Engineering The Hong Kong Polytechnic University Kowloon Hong Kong The lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic emphasize the need for building HVAC systems to be adaptable and prepared to adjust their operation for infection risk mitigation for future pandemics. Most guidelines suggest increasing outdoor air fraction in HVAC systems during pandemics. However, this approach is not energy-efficient due to the conditioning of additional outdoor air, and many practical systems face limitations in introducing more outdoor air than normal due to capacity or design constraints. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an alternative solution for HVAC system operation during pandemics that is energy-efficient, can effectively mitigate infection risks and does not require extensive retrofits to existing systems. To meet this need, this study proposes a practical real-time control strategy for high-performance HVAC operation in response to potential pandemic outbreaks. First, a supply air temperature (SAT) reset scheme for infection risk mitigation is proposed based on Mamdani fuzzy inference theory. Then, a coordinated control scheme is proposed to coordinate SAT reset with chilled water temperature adjustment for energy-efficiency enhancement. This strategy does not require system equipment retrofits but only changes in control logic to transition to pandemic operation. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is validated in a high-fidelity Modelica-based simulation environment under various weather conditions. Results show that, compared to normal operation, the proposed strategy can significantly reduce new infection cases by 32∼46 % without increasing energy use, and may even achieve slight energy savings of 9∼13 %, while maintaining expected occupant comfort.

The recent COVID-19 pandemic highlights the critical role of HVAC systems in maintaining indoor air quality and safeguarding public health [4\u20136]. As the world transitions to a post-pandemic era, new requirements have emerged for HVAC systems. In addition to maintaining comfortable indoor environments during non-pandemic periods [7], the HVAC system should possess adaptability and preparedness to adjust its operation for efficient infection risk control and disease transmission mitigation in response to the potential future pandemic outbreaks. The most straightforward HVAC operation strategy for infection risk control is to increase outdoor air supply, which has been recommended by many practical guidelines [8]. A document by ASHRAE [9] suggests that the HVAC system should operate with 100 % outdoor air for pandemic scenarios. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends increasing the outdoor airflow rate up to 10 L/s∙person [10]. However, conditioning an additional amount of outdoor air (for cooling, dehumidifying, or heating) will significantly increase energy consumption, especially during hot or cold weather [11]. This conflicts with energy-saving requirements driven by carbon-neutrality targets. A simulation study in Ref. [12] shows that energy consumption can rise by more than 200 % when increasing the outdoor air ratio from 30 % to 100 % in certain studied cities. A larger issue regarding increasing outdoor air supply lies in system design limits. HVAC systems are typically designed to operate under normal conditions. When a pandemic event occurs and there is a need to increase outdoor air supply, some systems may face limitations in introducing more outdoor air than usual due to constraints within the system, such as the capacity limit of the fresh air fan [13]. Additionally, the capacity limits of air handling units (AHUs) and chillers may prevent the excess outdoor air from being effectively cooled and dehumidified to the required condition, thereby affecting occupants\u2019 comfort [14]. Hence, to meet the increased outdoor air requirements during pandemics, it becomes necessary to adjust and retrofit the components in the system (AHUs, fresh air fan, and chiller). Considering the infrequent occurrence and low probability of pandemic events, retrofitting and increasing the system size in post-pandemic era would raise investment costs and lead to reduced energy efficiency during normal operation, rendering it economically inefficient [15]. Moreover, implementing these retrofits on existing systems presents significant challenges [16]. Therefore, it is imperative to explore alternative solutions which do not necessitate extensive retrofits to the system but only require appropriate adjustments to operation strategies to achieve effective infection risk control. The investigation of these solutions is highly meaningful for HVAC system operation in post-pandemic era, particularly for the aforementioned systems unable to increase outdoor air supply due to capacity limits. It enables HVAC systems to promptly and conveniently transition to a mode focused on mitigating disease transmission in response to potential unforeseen pandemic events. Unlike indoor-sourced noxious gases which can only be practically mitigated by diluting them with outdoor air ventilation, the transmission route of indoor infectious aerosols can be addressed by circulating already conditioned air through commonly-used commercial filters. Utilizing filtration on thermally-conditioned recirculated air may offer a better alternative solution [17]. Replacing filters in HVAC systems is convenient and feasible. Research [18] shows that using conventional HVAC filters with a MERV-11 rating can reduce infectious particle concentration by 68 %, while filter with a higher rating, such as MERV-13, can achieve an 86 % reduction. Using high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters can achieve a reduction in virus concentration of over 99 % [19,20]. However, relying solely on filter upgrades for infection control yields limited improvements. Adjusting system operation strategy to increase recirculated air can significantly enhance filtration effects, which offers a novel approach to further reducing infection risk [21]. Increasing recirculated air can be achieved by raising the supply air temperature (SAT) [22]. Research [23] indicates that adjusting SAT from 15 °C to 18 °C (with MERV-11 filters) can reduce infection risk by 40 %. Furthermore [23], also shows that the increase in fan energy consumption due to increased recirculated air is considerably less than the energy consumption required for conditioning additional outdoor air during hot summer season. It can be found from the existing studies above that the strategy of increasing recirculated air by raising SAT shows promising potential as a solution for the post-pandemic era. This includes the potential for effective infection control, energy savings, and only requiring changes to system control logics without necessitating laborious and cost-ineffective equipment retrofits. However, there remains a lack of research addressing operation control challenges in practical implementation. To successfully integrate this promising strategy into practical HVAC systems, it is imperative to investigate the following key issues: The first issue lies in real-time control of SAT. In practical HVAC systems, SAT is adjusted based on indoor temperature to meet indoor thermal load [24]. Normally, the SAT is maintained at a relatively low level to reduce fan energy consumption while preventing over-cooling of spaces [24]. During pandemics, there is a need to elevate SAT as much as possible to increase recirculated air and enhance filtration to reduce virus concentration. However, several control challenges needs to be addressed for real-time SAT adjustment for infection control purposes: \u2022 To what extent can SAT be increased? Setting SAT too high will result in the system failing to meet cooling and dehumidification loads in the space. Since these loads are constantly changing and hard to accurately predict, determining the upper limit for SAT that meets these loads is challenging. \u2022 How can the optimal real-time SAT adjustment be determined, i.e., increasing or decreasing the SAT by how much? The qualitative rules for SAT reset are easily inferred, but precise quantitative rules are difficult to obtain. To theoretically determine the precise amount of SAT adjustment, accurate information of indoor loads, precise AHU models and building thermal models are necessary. However, the above information is usually not available in practice. If the SAT reset amount is given inappropriately, the SAT cannot be adjusted to the expected highest level. Too fast adjustment may induce system oscillation while too slow adjustment could impede the timely attainment of optimal SAT. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an efficient real-time control strategy, which can adaptively and accurately adjust SAT based on actual operating conditions to set the SAT as high as possible while satisfying indoor temperature and humidity requirements. The second issue is that existing studies only explored SAT adjustment for infection mitigation purposes, focusing solely on the operation of the air-side system [23,25], without integrating optimal control of the water-side system. A noteworthy, yet unexplored, aspect is that higher SAT allows for the use of higher temperature of chilled water, which can help improve chiller COP and reduce water-side energy consumption. If the SAT adjustment for infection mitigation can be effectively coordinated with the adjustment of chilled water temperature, the increase in energy use on the air-side due to increased fan airflow rate may potentially be offset by the reduced energy use on the water-side by chillers. And this can lead to a more energy-efficient control solution. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the strategy of coordinating SAT adjustment and water-side control and its effect on the energy consumption of the complete HVAC system. Subsequently, we can further investigate whether it is possible to achieve effective infection control without increasing energy consumption while ensuring occupants\u2019 comfort. In this paper, we address the aforementioned issues by proposing a high-performance on-line control strategy for HVAC systems under pandemics, which integrates an SAT reset scheme for infection risk mitigation and a water-side control scheme for energy-efficient operation. For the SAT reset scheme, we propose a novel adaptive adjustment algorithm based on the Mamdani fuzzy inference model to dynamically reset the SAT. For the water-side control scheme, the trim-and-respond logic is utilized to adjust the setpoints of chilled water temperature and differential pressure (DP). The major contributions of this study can be summarized as follows: \u2022 Propose a real-time SAT reset scheme for infection risk mitigation: the proposed scheme can adaptively and accurately adjust SAT based on actual operating conditions using Mamdani fuzzy inference theory. It aims to set the SAT as high as possible while meeting indoor temperature and humidity requirements, thereby maximizing recirculated air to enhance filtration effects. \u2022 Propose a coordinated control scheme for energy efficiency enhancement: the SAT adjustment for infection mitigation is effectively coordinated with chilled water temperature adjustment via the proposed coordinated control scheme. It explores an important and rarely investigated energy-saving potential: higher SAT for infection mitigation allows for the use of higher temperature chilled water, which can help improve chiller COP and reduce water-side energy use. \u2022 Develop a practical real-time control strategy for HVAC systems in response to potential pandemic outbreaks in the post-pandemic era: the proposed strategy in this study can achieve effective infection control while ensuring energy-efficiency and occupants' comfort. When switching from normal to pandemic operation, the proposed strategy does not require extensive retrofits to system equipment but only changes in control logics, which can be implemented readily at the software level. 2 Proposed high-performance operation strategy for HVAC systems during pandemics 2.1 Outline of the proposed operation strategy Fig. 1 depicts a typical commercial HVAC system configuration including both air-side and water-side systems, and the outline of the proposed high-performance operation strategy during pandemics. The air-side system consists of the supply fan, the cooling coil, filters, duct network and terminal dampers, while the water-side system includes water pumps, the chiller and the cooling tower. Different types of sensors are installed in the duct or components to measure the air states. The proposed operation strategy integrates an SAT reset scheme for infection risk mitigation (as detailed in Section 2.2) and a water-side control scheme for energy-efficient operation (explained in Section 2.3), which determines the appropriate setpoints of SAT, chilled water temperature, and chilled water DP according to real-time operating conditions. Then, local feedback process controllers (i.e., PID controllers) maintain the operating variables at the predetermined setpoints. As the primary focus of this study is on the SAT reset mechanism for infection control purposes and its interaction with the chilled water temperature control, the determination of setpoints for other operating variables (fan static pressure, outdoor air fraction, etc.) is omitted from Fig. 1 and not discussed herein. In this study, the setpoints of other operating variables are determined based on the control sequences outlined in ASHRAE Guideline 36 [26], which is recognized as the state-of-the-art guideline for control sequences of practical HVAC systems to ensure energy-efficient operations. 2.2 Supply air temperature reset scheme with the proposed adaptive adjustment algorithm based on the mamdani fuzzy inference system This section introduces the proposed adaptive supply air temperature (SAT) adjustment algorithm based on the Mamdani fuzzy inference system. Section 2.2.1 provides the motivation for utilizing fuzzy inference, and Section 2.2.2 introduces the input variables of the SAT reset scheme. Sections 2.2.3-2.2.5 detail the basic components of the fuzzy inference system for SAT reset, including fuzzification (Section 2.2.3), fuzzy inference based on the fuzzy control rule base (Section 2.2.4) and defuzzification (Section 2.2.5). Section 2.2.6 presents a summarized flowchart illustrating the proposed SAT adjustment algorithm based on the fuzzy inference system. The basic structure of the fuzzy inference system for SAT reset is shown in Fig. 2 . 2.2.1 Motivation for utilizing fuzzy inference The core idea of the SAT reset scheme is to maintain the SAT at the highest feasible level which satisfies cooling and dehumidification loads, aiming to maximize the recirculated air and enhance filtration effects for infection mitigation. The SAT setpoint is reset in real-time based on measured indoor temperature and humidity according to specific adjustment rules. These SAT adjustment rules are the key part of the SAT reset scheme. Qualitative rules for SAT reset are easily inferred, but precise quantitative rules are difficult to determine. For example, when indoor humidity is higher than desired, it is straightforward to infer that the SAT should be lowered to enhance dehumidification. However, determining the exact amount by which the SAT should be adjusted is challenging. To theoretically determine the precise amount of SAT adjustment, accurate information of indoor loads, precise AHU models and building thermal models are necessary. Unfortunately, the above information is usually not available in practice. The main advantage of fuzzy control is its ability to handle qualitative or linguistic information [27]. This capability allows it to incorporate expert knowledge and heuristic rules that are often expressed in qualitative terms. The fuzzy logic process involves first converting numerical inputs into qualitative fuzzy sets (fuzzification), then applying a set of qualitative \u201cIF-THEN\u201d rules to these fuzzified inputs to generate fuzzy outputs (fuzzy inference), and finally transforming the fuzzy outputs back into numerical values for control decisions (defuzzification). Fuzzy logic handles imprecision and uncertainty well, allowing for reasoning with vague or qualitative information. The fuzzy logic-based approach is advantageous when qualitative control rules can be easily inferred but obtaining quantitative rules is difficult. The design of the control rules can be achieved qualitatively, without the need for precise quantitative rules. Therefore, employing fuzzy control to develop SAT reset scheme in this study is highly appropriate. 2.2.2 Input variables of the SAT reset scheme The control output (i.e., adjustment of SAT, denoted as d T s a ) is determined according to indoor temperature and humidity. Three variables ( T z o n e ( max ) , d T z o n e ( max ) , R H r e t , as shown in Fig. 2) are selected to comprehensively represent indoor environment conditions and serves as the indicators for adjusting SAT. The reasons for selecting these variables are as follows: (1) The highest temperature of all zones (denoted as T z o n e ( max ) ): the zone with the highest indoor temperature is typically where cooling requirement is most challenging to satisfy. Ensuring T z o n e ( max ) remains below the maximum temperature limit implies that all zone temperatures are also below this limit. (2) Gradient of T z o n e ( max ) (denoted as d T z o n e ( max ) ): Inclusion of this variable as an indicator for SAT reset is due to the significant time delay in indoor temperature changes after adjusting SAT, which arises from the thermal inertia of building zones. Relying solely on T z o n e ( max ) may pose challenges in achieving precise temperature control. For instance, even if the current T z o n e ( max ) is within a reasonable range, the rapid increase of T z o n e ( max ) necessitates reducing SAT to prevent exceeding the maximum limit in the near future. (3) Relative humidity of return air (denoted as R H r e t ): Increasing the SAT may lead to the zone relative humidity exceeding its upper limit. Therefore, zone relative humidity is an indispensable indicator for adjusting SAT to ensure humidity requirements are met. However, in practical scenarios, sensors for measuring humidity are generally placed in the return air duct rather than in each building zone. Thus, the relative humidity of return air is selected to represent humidity conditions in building zones. 2.2.3 Membership functions and fuzzification of input and output variables Fuzzification converts the numerical values of input and output variables into linguistic terms. The fuzzy subset containing linguistic terms to describe T z o n e ( max ) is defined as A = {A 1 =cold, A 2 =cool, A 3 =mild, A 4 =warm, A 5 =hot } . The fuzzy subset for R H r e t is defined as B = { B 1 =comfortable, B 2 =slightly humid, B 3 = humid }. The fuzzy subset for the gradient of T z o n e ( max ) is defined as C = { C 1 =significantly negative ( SI\u2013N ), C 2 =slightly negative ( SL-N ), C 3 =around zero ( AZ ), C 4 =slightly positive ( SL-P ), C 5 =significantly positive ( SI\u2013P ) }. The fuzzy subset for SAT adjustment d T s a is D = { D 1 =decrease significantly ( D-SI ), D 2 =decrease moderately ( D-M ), D 3 =decrease slightly ( D-SL ), D 4 =remain constant ( RC ), D 5 =increase slightly ( I-SL ), D 6 =increase moderately ( I-M ), D 7 =increase significantly ( I\u2013SI ) }. To convert the numerical values into the above linguistic terms, membership functions (abbreviated as MF hereafter) for input/output variables must be defined. In this study, the indoor temperature setpoint is 24 °C, with a comfortable range of 23\u201325 °C and an acceptable range of 22\u201326 °C. Therefore, it is reasonable to maintain the maximum temperature of all zones at 25 °C. Additionally, the indoor relative humidity should be maintained below 70 % [28]. Based on these settings, the MFs for T z o n e ( max ) and R H r e t are determined, as shown in Fig. 3 -(a) and Fig. 3-(b), respectively. For the practical control system, the gradient of T z o n e ( max ) is replaced by the difference between the value of T z o n e ( max ) at the current sampling point and the last sampling point. The adjustment of SAT d T s a is the amount by which the SAT setpoint needs to change at the current time step (i.e., the difference between the value of SAT setpoint at the next time step and the current step). The time step length in this study is 5 min. Considering the maximum variations for zone temperature and SAT in 5 min are typically less than 1 °C and 0.5 °C in practice, respectively, the MFs for d T z o n e ( max ) and d T s a are determined, as shown in Fig. 3-(c) and Fig. 3-(d), respectively. For a given numerical value x (e.g., x is a temperature value), the membership degree of this value to the linguistic term A i ( i = 1 , 2 , . . . , 5 ) can be calculated via the MF μ A i ( x ) . If μ A i ( x ) > 0 , A i is called a fired term, expressed by A j ( f i r e d ) ( j = 1 , 2 , . . . , m ) . m is the number of fired terms in A i ( i = 1 , 2 , . . . , 5 ) . 2.2.4 Design of the fuzzy control rule base for supply air temperature reset The fuzzy control rule R ( i , j , k ) for SAT reset is of the following \u201cIF-THEN\u201d form: (1) R ( i , j , k ) : IF T z o n e ( max ) is A i and R H r e t is B j and d T z o n e ( max ) is C k , THEN d T s a is D l ( i = 1 , 2 , . . . , 5 j = 1 , 2 , 3 k = 1 , 2 , . . . , 5 l = 1 , 2 , . . . , 7 ) The rule base for SAT reset contains 75 different control rules established in accordance with expert knowledge. This rule base is designed according to the following 3 steps: Step 1 (Developing a simplified rule base without considering humidity): assuming R H r e t is always \u201ccomfortable\u201d, we analyze and establish qualitative relationships between d T s a and T z o n e ( max ) , d T z o n e ( max ) . Fig. 4 shows 4 regions with varying T z o n e ( max ) , d T z o n e ( max ) . \u2022 In region 1, where the temperature exceeds the desired value (25 °C) and continues to rise. It indicates that the SAT is set too high, failing to meet cooling demands. Hence, SAT should be significantly reduced. \u2022 In region 2, although the temperature exceeds the desired value, it begins to decline. Further reduction of SAT is required to restore the temperature to the desired value. However, this reduction should be slight to prevent excessive cooling. \u2022 In region 3, the temperature falls below the desired value and continues to decrease, suggesting that the SAT is set too low and building zones are overcooled. Hence, SAT should be significantly increased. \u2022 In region 4, the temperature falls below the desired value but starts to rise. Further elevation of SAT is required to restore the temperature to the desired value. Again, this increase should be slight to prevent excessive temperature rise. A simplified rule base containing 4 SAT control rules for above 4 regions is summarized in Table 1 : Step 2 (Expanding the rule base from step 1): As mentioned in Section 2.2.2, fuzzy sets for T z o n e ( max ) , d T z o n e ( max ) and d T s a include more fuzzy grades than those listed in Table 1. By expanding the rule base in Table 1, a more comprehensive rule base (shown in Table 2 , the part for \u201c R H r e t is comfortable\u201d) can be obtained. Various fuzzy grades of d T s a are depicted using different shades of colors to facilitate comparison. Step 3 (Integrating humidity into the rule base): The rule base developed in step 1&2 assumes comfortable humidity. However, if the humidity level is uncomfortable, control rules must be adjusted accordingly. Increased SAT reduces the system's dehumidification ability, which may lead to uncomfortable humidity levels. Thus, when R H r e t becomes \u201cslightly humid\u201d or \u201chumid\u201d, it is necessary to reduce SAT to enhance dehumidification. The rule base for such conditions can be modified based on the rule base for comfortable humidity, by further reducing the fuzzy grades of d T s a for each rule. Specifically, changing \u201cD-M\u201d to \u201cD-SI represents a 1-level reduction in fuzzy grade (from D2 to D1), while changing \u201cRC\u201d to \u201cD-SI\u201d represents a 3-level reduction in fuzzy grade (from D4 to D1). Compared to the rule base established for comfortable humidity, the fuzzy grade for each rule is reduced by \u201c1 level\u201d for \u201cslightly humid\u201d and \u201c3 levels\u201d for \u201chumid\u201d. The rule bases for \u201cslightly humid\u201d and \u201chumid\u201d are presented in Table 2. Up to this point, the rule base for SAT reset scheme in this study has been designed, as shown in Table 2. In total, there are 75 different control rules. Consider one of these rules R ( i , j , k ) (see eq. (1)), which has 3 antecedents T z o n e ( max ) \u2033 is A i \u2033 , R H r e t \u2033 is B j \u2033 , and d T z o n e ( max ) \u2033 is C k \u2033 , where A i ∈ A , B j ∈ B , C k ∈ C . The Cartesian product of fuzzy sets A , B , C is also a fuzzy set, denoted by A × B × C , and it is characterized by the MF μ A × B × C . For a particular input x \u2032 = ( T z o n e ( max ) , d T z o n e ( max ) , R H r e t ) , we say rule R ( i , j , k ) is fired to the degree μ A i × B j × C k ( x \u2032 ) : (2) μ A i × B j × C k ( x \u2032 ) = min ( μ A i ( T z o n e ( max ) ) , μ B j ( d T z o n e ( max ) ) , μ C k ( R H r e t ) ) The rule is called \u201ca fired rule\u201d if μ A i × B j × C k ( x \u2032 ) > 0 . The set of all fired rules for a particular input x \u2032 is given by: (3) F ( x \u2032 ) = { R ( i , j , k ) | μ A i × B j × C k ( x \u2032 ) > 0 , A i ∈ A , B j ∈ B , C k ∈ C } The consequent \u2033 d T s a is D l \u2033 of the rule R ( i , j , k ) can be obtained by referring to Table 2. 2.2.5 Defuzzification The function of the defuzzification stage is to convert the collection of recommendations of all fired rules F ( x \u2032 ) into a numerical output. For one of the fired rules R ( i , j , k ) (i.e., If T z o n e ( max ) is A i and R H r e t is B j and d T z o n e ( max ) is C k , then d T s a is D l ) and it has a recommendation \u2033 d T s a is D l \u2033 characterized by the MF μ D l . The recommendation of R ( i , j , k ) is attenuated by its fired level μ A i × B j × C k ( x \u2032 ) , and this produces a new MF called implied MF [29], denoted by μ ( A i , B j , C k ) → D l ( a t t e ) ( y ) . μ ( A i , B j , C k ) → D l ( a t t e ) ( y ) is given by: (4) μ ( A i , B j , C k ) → D l ( a t t e ) ( y ) = min ( μ D l ( y ) , μ A i × B j × C k ( x \u2032 ) ) where y is the value of d T s a . μ D l ( y ) is the MF for the output quantity d T s a as illustrated in Fig. 3-(d). In order to arrive at one numerical output d T s a ( n u m e r i c a l ) ( x \u2032 ) for a particular input x \u2032 = ( T z o n e ( max ) , d T z o n e ( max ) , R H r e t ), we combine all of these recommendations by taking a weighted average of various recommendations. There are several ways to achieve this. In this study, the center of gravity (COG) method [29] is utilized. First, define the center of area of μ ( A i , B j , C k ) → D l ( a t t e ) ( y ) to be the value y s , which is calculated by: (5) ∫ − ∞ y s μ ( A i , B j , C k ) → D l ( a t t e ) ( y ) d y = ∫ y s + ∞ μ ( A i , B j , C k ) → D l ( a t t e ) ( y ) d y The numerical output of the fuzzy system given the input x \u2032 = ( T z o n e ( max ) , d T z o n e ( max ) , R H r e t ) is calculated using COG as: (6) d T s a ( n u m e r i c a l ) ( x \u2032 ) = ∑ r = 1 N r y s ∫ − ∞ + ∞ μ ( A i ( r ) , B j ( r ) , C k ( r ) ) → D l ( r ) ( a t t e ) ( y ) d y ∑ r = 1 N r ∫ − ∞ + ∞ μ ( A i ( r ) , B j ( r ) , C k ( r ) ) → D l ( r ) ( a t t e ) ( y ) d y where μ ( A i ( r ) , B j ( r ) , C k ( r ) ) → D l ( r ) ( a t t e ) ( y ) is the implied MF for the recommendation of the r t h rule in F ( x \u2032 ) . ∫ − ∞ + ∞ μ ( A i ( r ) , B j ( r ) , C k ( r ) ) → D l ( r ) ( a t t e ) ( y ) d y is the area under μ ( A i ( r ) , B j ( r ) , C k ( r ) ) → D l ( r ) ( a t t e ) ( y ) . N r is the number of rules in F ( x \u2032 ) . 2.2.6 Adaptive adjustment algorithm for supply air temperature reset Fig. 5 shows the flowchart of the proposed adaptive adjustment algorithm for SAT reset based on Mamdani fuzzy inference system. In Fig. 5, T s a ( min ) and T s a ( max ) are the lower limit and upper limit for the SAT setpoint, which are set as 12 °C and 20 °C, respectively [24]. 2.3 Water-side control scheme with the trim-and-respond logic In Section 2.2, a supply air temperature (SAT) reset scheme based on Mamdani fuzzy inference system is developed. The SAT is adjusted to its highest feasible level according to real-time operating conditions to increase recirculated air, thereby enhancing filtration effects for infection control purposes. Another advantageous aspect of raising SAT is that it allows for the use of higher temperature of chilled water, which can help improve chiller COP and reduce water-side energy consumption [24]. Therefore, an energy-efficient control solution arises by coordinating the proposed SAT reset scheme with a water-side control scheme which adjusts T c h w s to its highest feasible level. In this study, the water-side control scheme is developed based on trim-and-respond logics in Ref. [26]. Fig. 6 illustrates the framework of the water-side control scheme, which includes 3 modules. T C H W S ( s e t ) , D P C H W S ( s e t ) denote the setpoints of supplied chilled water (CW) temperature and differential pressure, respectively. Module 1: The number of requests is generated according to the measured SAT and chilled water valve position via the following rules [26]: \u2022 If the SAT exceeds its setpoint by 3 °C for 2 min, generate three requests. \u2022 If the SAT exceeds its setpoint by 2 °C for 2 min, generate two requests. \u2022 If the CW valve position is greater than 95 %, generate one request until it is less than 85 %. \u2022 If the CW valve position is less than 95 %, do not generate requests. A request is a call to reset T C H W S ( s e t ) , D P C H W S ( s e t ) generated by downstream AHUs. The generation of requests indicates that the cooling capacity provided by chilled water is not sufficient, and either T C H W S ( s e t ) should be decreased or D P C H W S ( s e t ) should be increased. Module 2: The CW reset signal C H W r e s e t , n e x t for the next time step is determined based on the number of requests M using the trim-and-respond logic, as outlined in Table 3 . Module 3: The CW reset signal C H W r e s e t is mapped to the values of T C H W S ( s e t ) and D P C H W S ( s e t ) by the relationship illustrated in Fig. 7 [26]. As C H W r e s e t increases, D P C H W S ( s e t ) is initially raised while T C H W S ( s e t ) remains unchanged until D P C H W S ( s e t ) reaches its maximum value. Subsequently, T C H W S ( s e t ) begins to decrease with further increase in C H W r e s e t . The water-side control scheme described above can adjust T c h w s to its highest feasible level in real-time, ensuring the requirement of the air-side system, i.e., maintaining the SAT at its setpoint. 3 Validation test arrangement 3.1 Modelica-based dynamic modeling and simulation for the complete HVAC system The validation test platform for this study consists of a six-floor office building with a complete HVAC system. When developing the dynamic model of the HVAC system (shown in Fig. 1), we utilized a high-fidelity model (Buildings.Examples.VAVReheat.Guideline 36 [30]) from Modelica Buildings Library [31], a free open-source library for modeling building energy and control systems. This model includes a variable-air-volume (VAV) HVAC system, a building envelope model with 5 zones, and a model for air flow through building leakage and through open doors [30]. We assumed that the model for each floor of the testing building is identical to the building envelope model in Ref. [30]. While the HVAC system model [30] covers all basic components of the air-side system, such as AHU, duct networks, terminal dampers, and economizers, it does not include essential components of the water-side system such as chillers and cooling towers. In addition, neither the SAT reset scheme proposed in Section 2.2 nor the reset scheme of T C H W S ( s e t ) , D P C H W S ( s e t ) introduced in Section 2.3 are covered in the model [30]. Thus, the following additions are incorporated into the model [30] to support comprehensive validation of the proposed strategy: First, we developed a Modelica-based model for the variable primary-only pumping system on the water side. The variable-speed pumps are controlled to maintain the DP of the AHU branch. A bypass control valve and a flow meter are installed to maintain the minimum flow through the chillers [24]. For ease of analysis, we consider a single chiller supplying chilled water to 6 identical AHUs, with each AHU serving one floor. Thus, the temperature and flowrate of the return chilled water from each AHU are assumed to be the same. Second, the water-side control scheme illustrated in Fig. 6 is implemented in OpenModelica [32]. The adjustment ranges for T C H W S ( s e t ) , D P C H W S ( s e t ) are set as 6\u201313 °C and 2∼9 kPa, respectively in this study. Third, the SAT reset scheme illustrated in Fig. 5 is implemented in OpenModelica. In this study, the adjustment range for T s a ( s e t ) is set to 12\u201320 °C [24]. Specifically, the fuzzy inference system (Fig. 2) is implemented using the control description language (CDL) [33] and encapsulated into a module called Fuzzy Inference. 3.2 Virus dynamics modeling and infection risk assessment To assess infection risk, it is necessary to model virus dynamics within building zones. In this study, the well-mixed assumption is applied, which assumes uniform virus distribution within each zone. Fig. 8 illustrates the virus transportation via different air exchange processes in each zone. Based on the conservation of virus particles and the air exchange processes illustrated in Fig. 8, the following equation can be derived to depict the evolution of virus concentration over time in each zone ( i = 1 , 2 , . . . , 5 representing the eastern, western, northern, southern and core zones, respectively): (7) V [ i ] d C [ i ] d t = N infector [ i ] P + q s u p p l y [ i ] C s u p p l y + q d o o r [ i ] C [ 5 ] − ( q r e t u r n [ i ] + q l e a k [ i ] + q d o o r [ i ] + k d e c a y V [ i ] ) C [ i ] ( i = 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) V [ 5 ] d C [ 5 ] d t = N infector [ 5 ] P + q s u p p l y [ 5 ] C s u p p l y + ∑ j = 1 4 q d o o r [ j ] C [ j ] − ( q r e t u r n [ i ] + ∑ j = 1 4 q d o o r [ j ] + k d e c a y V [ i ] ) C [ i ] where N infector [ i ] is the number of infectors in zone i . V [ i ] is the volume of zone i . C [ i ] is the virus concentration in zone i (unit: quanta/m3). C s u p p l y is the virus concentration of the air supplied to zone i via the HVAC system. k d e c a y is the virus decay rate, which equals 0.62 h−1 (0.3 h−1 for the deposition loss and 0.32 h−1 for the deactivation loss) [34]. P is the virus generation rate of each infector, which equals 5 quanta/h for office work [34]. The occupancy rate is 18.6 m2/person [35] and the disease prevalence rate α is assumed to be 5 % [34]. N infector [ i ] equals the product of α and the number of occupants in zone i N [ i ] . The occupancy profile used in this study is based on [36]. The flowrates for each air exchange process (colored in blue in eq. (7), including supply airflow rate q s u p p l y [ i ] , return airflow rate q r e t u r n [ i ] , air leakage rate of the building envelope q l e a k [ i ] and air exchange rate through open doors q d o o r [ i ] ) are obtained from the simulation of HVAC system operation in OpenModelica. The return air from 5 zones is mixed in a common plenum. The evolution of virus concentration in the common plenum C p l e n u m over time is given by: (8) V p l e n u m d C p l e n u m d t = ∑ j = 1 5 q r e t u r n [ j ] C [ j ] − ∑ j = 1 5 q r e t u r n [ j ] C p l e n u m Part of the return air is mixed with the introduced outdoor air. Then, the mixed air passes through the filter, where infectious particles are filtered out. The filter has an efficiency of ε and the outdoor air fraction is f . The relationship between C p l e n u m and C s u p p l y is given by: (9) C s u p p l y = C p l e n u m ( 1 − f ) ( 1 − ε ) Eq.(7)\u2013(9) can be solved by the Runge\u2013Kutta method, which is implemented in Matlab. After knowing the virus concentration C [ i ] , the infection risk p [ i ] in zone i is evaluated by: (10) p [ i ] = 1 − Exp ( − Q b ∫ t = t 1 t = t 2 C [ i ] d t ) where Q b is the volumetric breathing rate of an occupant, which equals 0.54 m3/h [34]. [ t 1 , t 2 ] is the occupancy period, which is 8:00\u201318:00 in this study. Then, the number of new infections in all zones N new − infections in the test building for this study can be estimated by: (11) N new − infections = 6 × ∑ j = 1 5 p [ i ] ( N [ i ] − N infector [ i ] ) As stated in Section 3.1, the model for each floor of the testing building is assumed to be identical and this building consists of 6 floors. Therefore, the number of new infections in 5 zones on one floor must be multiplied by 6 to calculate the total number of new infections in this building. 3.3 Calculation of equivalent clean airflow for infection risk mitigation The calculation of virus concentration and the number of new infections in Section 3.2 provides a comprehensive view of infection risk conditions and the potential of each strategy to remove infectious particles. However, it does not isolate the individual effect of each removal mechanism (outdoor air ventilation, filtration on recirculated air, deactivation and deposition of infectious particles). To compare and combine the effects for different removal mechanisms, ASHRAE Standard 241 [37] introduces a new concept of \u201cequivalent clean airflow\u201d (ECA), which gives the equivalent volumetric flow of particle-free clean air that would provide the same removal rate of infectious particles. The calculation equation for the ECA is given by: (12) E C A t o t a l = f q s u p p l y V + ε ( 1 − f ) q s u p p l y V + k d e c a y where the first term f q s u p p l y / V corresponds to the ECA for outdoor air ventilation, the second term ε ( 1 − f ) q s u p p l y / V corresponds to the ECA for filtration of recirculated air and the third term k d e c a y corresponds to the ECA for the deactivation and deposition of infectious particles. q s u p p l y is the total supply airflow rate. V is the total volume of the building zones. It should be noted that the ECA calculated in this study is expressed in the unit of air changes per hour (ACH). It should be noted that ASHRAE Standard 241 [37] does not include the third term k d e c a y in the definition of the ECA. By incorporating k d e c a y , we account for the removal of infectious particles through natural decay and deposition processes. This inclusion provides a more comprehensive understanding of the ECA calculation in the context of this study. Calculating the ECA does not require complex epidemiological data such as the virus quanta generation rate of the infector, the respiratory rate of occupants, or the population infection rate. It provides a more straightforward assessment of the HVAC system's ability to remove infectious pathogens. By analyzing the breakdown of each term of the ECA, the infection mitigation mechanisms for different control strategies can be clearly illustrated. 3.4 Control strategies used in comparison tests Four control strategies for HVAC system operation are tested and compared. A description of these strategies is given as follows: Strategy 1 ( normal strategy ): This strategy is used for HVAC operation under normal scenarios. The chilled water reset scheme, introduced in Section 2.3, is applied. The outdoor airflow rate is kept above the minimum outdoor air requirements. The required minimum outdoor airflow rate per person is set at 2.5 L/(s∙person), as stated in Ref. [38]. Strategy 2 ( pandemic strategy \u2013 Increase fresh air amount ): This strategy is used for HVAC operation under pandemic scenarios. In compared to Strategy 1, the required minimum outdoor airflow rate per person is increased from 2.5 L/(s∙person) to 10 L/(s∙person), following the WHO recommendations for operations during pandemics [10]. Other settings remain the same as Strategy 1. It should be noted that both Strategy 1 and Strategy 2 utilize the SAT reset scheme in ASHRAE Guideline 36 to adjust the SAT setpoint. Strategy 3 ( pandemic strategy \u2013 proposed strategy ): This strategy is the proposed approach in this study for HVAC operation under pandemic scenarios. It incorporates the SAT reset scheme proposed in Section 2.2 and the chilled water reset scheme introduced in Section 2.3. The minimum outdoor airflow rate requirements are the same as those in Strategy 1. Strategy 4 ( pandemic strategy \u2013 Guideline 36 with modified parameters for SAT reset scheme ): This strategy is similar to strategy 1, both utilizing the SAT reset scheme from ASHRAE Guideline 36 and the same setting for minimum required outdoor airflow. The only difference is that strategy 4 modifies the parameters of the SAT reset scheme to allow continuous resetting of the SAT, regardless of the outdoor temperature. The SAT is reset as high as possible using trim-and-respond logic, which adjusts the SAT setpoint based on temperature feedback of each zone to maintain indoor temperature within a comfortable range. It should be noted that this SAT reset scheme does not consider humidity feedback. Details about the basic principles of the SAT reset scheme in ASHRAE Guideline 36 and the modifications made in strategy 4 are included in the Appendix (supplementary materials). Additionally, strategy 4 also incorporates the chilled water reset scheme introduced in Section 2.3. It is important to note that the filter used in each of the above strategies is maintained at the same level (e.g., MERV-13) to ensure a fair comparison of results. The adjustment range for the SAT setpoint is the same for all strategies, which is 12∼20 °C [24]. Comparison results for a specific strategy with different filter levels are also presented in Section 4.2. 4 Results and discussions This section presents the operating results of the test HVAC system controlled by different strategies and compares their performance in terms of energy consumption, infection risk and thermal comfort. The simulations utilize Typical Meteorological Year (TMY) data for Hong Kong [39] to provide weather conditions. It is important to note that the building envelope parameters used in this study comply with the Hong Kong public building design standards [40]. 4.1 General operating results of the proposed strategy Fig. 9 shows the comparative results for T S A T ( s e t ) , T C H W S ( s e t ) and recirculated airflow rate under strategies 1\u20134 over a 3-day simulation period (July 8∼July 10). The \u201coccupancy periods\u201d are highlighted with a yellow background to indicate times when the space is occupied and the indoor temperature should be maintained within a comfortable range. During unoccupied period, T S A T ( s e t ) and T C H W S ( s e t ) are set to 24 °C and 6 °C, respectively, and the HVAC system is turned off. As depicted in Fig. 9, the HVAC system starts a short while before the occupancy period begins. This morning precooling period ensures the building zone reaches the desired temperature by the time occupants arrive. The duration of the precooling period varies among different strategies because each strategy controls the indoor environment differently. As illustrated in Fig. 9-(a), the SAT setpoint for the proposed strategy (strategy 3) typically ranges from 15 °C to 19 °C, which is higher than that of strategies 1 and 2. Strategies 1 and 2 adopt the SAT reset scheme in ASHRAE Guideline 36, maintaining the setpoint of 12 °C throughout the simulation period from Jul 8 to Jul 10. In cooler seasons, the SAT reset scheme in ASHRAE Guideline 36 may adjust the SAT setpoint to higher levels. Strategy 4 adjusts the SAT setpoint to even higher levels than strategy 3. Higher SAT in strategy 3 and 4 results in an increased recirculated airflow rate (as depicted in Fig. 9-(c)), enhancing the filtration effect to reduce virus concentration and mitigate infection risk. Concurrently, the water-side control scheme can effectively coordinate with the SAT reset scheme, which utilizes chilled water at the highest possible temperature (as shown in Fig. 9-(b)). Under strategies 3 and 4, the chilled water can be adjusted to a higher level (10 °C\u201313 °C), in contrast to strategies 1 and 2, which maintains the chilled water temperature below 8 °C in most of the time. The opportunity to use higher temperature chilled water under the proposed strategy allows the chiller to operate at higher COP levels, which reduces energy use of the chiller. It should be noted that strategy 4 can achieve higher SAT and thus a higher recirculation rate than the proposed strategy, offering more potential for infection risk mitigation. However, this comes at the cost of thermal comfort; the indoor humidity requirements may not be satisfied under strategy 4 since it adjusts the SAT based solely on indoor temperature. Relevant results and discussions can be found in Section 4.2.3. 4.2 Comparison of system performance using different operation strategies To comprehensively compare the performance of different operation strategies, the simulation experiments were conducted over three selected 7-day periods in different seasons to cover the full spectrum of weather conditions in Hong Kong: (1) a hot summer week (Jul 8-Jul 14), (2) a mild autumn week (Oct 20-Oct 26) and (3) a cool winter week (Dec 4-Dec 10). 4.2.1 Performance relating to controlling infection risk Fig. 10 illustrates variations in virus concentration within the core zone under different strategies. It shows that three pandemic operation strategies (strategies 2\u20134) are effective in reducing virus concentration compared to normal operation (strategy 1). Specifically, the proposed strategy (strategy 3) achieves greater reduction than strategy 2 but less than strategy 4. To achieve the reduction seen with the proposed strategy, strategy 2 would need to increase the fresh air rate to more than 10 L/(s∙person). Strategy 4 achieves the lowest virus concentration due to its highest recirculation rate, as shown in Fig. 9. Fig. 11 compares daily new infections under these strategies during three test periods. The proposed strategy results in fewer new infections for all test periods than strategies 1 and 2, demonstrating its effectiveness in infection risk control and its suitability for pandemic operations. While strategy 4 shows better infection mitigation performance than the proposed strategy, it fails to maintain expected occupants\u2019 comfort, unlike the proposed strategy. Relevant comparisons will be discussed in the following section. To further analyze the infection mitigation mechanisms for each strategy, the ECA for each strategy is calculated, and the comparative results for ECA under different control strategies during three test periods are shown in Fig. 12 . Fig. 12 provides the daily breakdown of ECA by source (i.e., outdoor air ventilation, filtration of recirculated air, deposition and deactivation of infectious particles). All values are averaged over occupied period for each day. From these results, we can make the following three key observations. First, the proposed strategy (S3) and S4 significantly increases the ECA for filtration of recirculated air compared to S1 and S2 for all test cases. This is the main reason why S3 and S4 can significantly reduce the infection risk and the number of new infections. The significant increase in ECA for filtration of recirculated air is achieved by raising the SAT setpoint, which increases the supply airflow and thus the recirculated air. Second, increasing the outdoor air (S2) has an unexpectedly small impact on the total ECA compared to S1. This phenomenon also appears in Fig. 11. Despite the outdoor airflow rate per person for S2 being four times that for S1, the ECA for outdoor air ventilation only increases by around 0.6 ACH for most test days. This increase is comparable to the ECA for virus deposition and deactivation, which equals 0.62 ACH. Additionally, increasing the outdoor air reduces the recirculated air, thereby decreasing the ECA for filtration of recirculated air, as shown in Fig. 12. These opposing effects cancel each other out, resulting in a less significant impact on the total ECA. Third, from Fig. 12-(c), we can see that the difference in daily ECA for outdoor air ventilation among these strategies is not substantial on Dec 6 and Dec 7. This is because the weather during these days is cooler, and the system operates at economizer conditions during some hours (introducing 100 % outdoor air during these hours, making minimum ventilation irrelevant). 4.2.2 Performance relating to energy consumption Fig. 13 illustrates the daily energy consumption of each component in the HVAC system (serving the six floors of the test building) for strategies 1\u20134. Among these strategies, strategy 2 exhibits the highest total energy consumption on most days. This is attributed to its increased fresh air rate, which is raised from 2.5 L/(s∙person) to 10 L/(s∙person). The higher fresh air rate leads to a greater need for cooling and dehumidification, thereby increasing the energy demands on the chiller and cooling tower, especially in summer when fresh air is warmer and more humid. As depicted in Fig. 13, strategies 3 and 4 consumes slightly less energy compared to strategy 1. The primary reason is the utilization of chilled water at higher temperatures, which enables the chiller to operate at a higher COP for most of the time. This significantly lowers chiller energy consumption. Although S3 and S4 increase fan energy use due to increased recirculated air for infection control, this additional fan energy need is more than compensated by the reduction in chiller energy consumption. Moreover, S3 and S4 slightly increase the indoor temperature and humidity level (relevant results are discussed in Section 4.2.3). And this will slightly decrease the cooling and dehumidification load, thereby reducing the energy use of the chiller and chilled water pumps. The above phenomenon suggests that the energy-efficiency of the proposed strategy for pandemic operation not only aligns with normal operation strategy but slightly surpasses it. 4.2.3 Performance relating to thermal comfort Fig. 14 shows the probability density distribution of zone temperature and relative humidity over three test periods. It is evident that strategies 3 and 4 slightly raise the zone temperature level compared to strategies 1 and 2. Strategies 3 and 4 effectively maintain it within the comfortable range of 23\u201325 °C most of the time. In terms of humidity, strategies 3 and 4 increase the humidity level obviously, particularly during hot seasons like summer. This is due to the higher SAT setpoint employed in strategies 3 and 4 which reduces the dehumidification ability of the HVAC system. Comparing strategies 3 and 4, strategy 3 keeps the humidity level within the defined comfortable range (below 70 %) most of the time, while the humidity level of strategy 4 exceeds 70 % most of the time, failing to meet indoor humidity requirements. The humidity issue associated with strategy 4 arises because it adjusts the SAT based solely on indoor temperature without considering humidity. When the sensible heat ratio is relatively large (indicating a small latent load), strategy 4 may maintain both comfortable temperature and humidity levels, despite reduced dehumidification ability from raising the SAT. However, when the sensible heat ratio is small (indicating a large latent load), strategy 4 cannot maintain acceptable humidity levels due to insufficient dehumidification at a high SAT. In such scenarios, moisture control should be prioritized (i.e., limiting the SAT based on humidity feedback) to maintain expected occupants' comfort. The proposed strategy incorporates such humidity considerations into the fuzzy control rule base and thus it can achieve effective infection control without sacrificing occupants\u2019 comfort. Another benefit of the proposed strategy over strategy 4 is that it allows the operator to balance indoor humidity level and infection control performance. Specifically, this balance can be achieved by shifting the MFs to lower or higher humidity regions shown in Fig. 3. Allowing a higher humidity level will increase the SAT level, enhancing infection mitigation performance, and vice versa. To validate this benefit, we tested and compared the performance of the proposed strategy under different humidity control requirements. Four levels were designed for humidity requirements: 1) Humidity Level 1 (HL-1, strictest): indoor humidity level should be maintained below 65 % most of the time; 2) Humidity Level 2 (HL-2, moderate):indoor humidity level should be maintained below 70 % most of the time; 3) Humidity Level 3 (HL-3, relaxed): indoor humidity level should be maintained below 75 % most of the time; 4) Humidity Level 4 (HL-4, most relaxed): indoor humidity level should be maintained below 80 % most of the time; For these levels, the critical points defining the membership functions in Fig. 3-(b) are set as [60 %, 62.5 %, 65 %] for HL-1, [65 %, 67.5 %, 70 %] for HL-2, [70 %, 72.5 %, 75 %] for HL-3 and [75 %, 77.5 %, 80 %] for HL-4. Except for results in Fig. 15 , other results for the proposed strategy in this paper are all based on HL-2. Fig. 15 shows comparative results for strategy 4 (S4) and strategy 3 with different humidity requirements. Lower humidity requirements constrain the SAT to lower levels and thus weaken the infection control performance. Fig. 15 demonstrates that the proposed strategy allows flexible adjustment of humidity requirements and can reliably control indoor humidity as required. In contrast, strategy 4 cannot control indoor humidity adequately and has severe humidity issues, especially in scenarios with low sensible heat ratios. Another interesting observation is that the proposed strategy can achieve very similar, good infection control performance compared to strategy 4 by adjusting the humidity requirement level from the previously mentioned HL-2 to HL-3. 4.2.4 Summary of performance using different operation strategies The performance results summarized in Table 4 demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy (S3) in infection control, with a reduction in new infections by 32∼46 % compared to the normal operation strategy (S1). S3 also outperforms the strategy of increasing fresh air (S2) which only achieves a reduction of 7∼11 % in new infections. Additionally, S3 exhibits slightly better energy efficiency than S1, resulting in energy savings of 9∼13 %. In contrast, S2 shows worse energy efficiency, leading to an energy consumption increase of around 20 % during the hot summer season. Therefore, S3 achieves superior performance in terms of both energy efficiency and infection control. While strategy 4 (S4) achieves better infection control performance than S3, with a reduction in new infections by 47∼53 % compared to normal operation, it fails to maintain indoor humidity within the comfortable range, resulting in much higher humidity levels than the other strategies. Among these four strategies, only the proposed strategy (S3) can achieve effective infection control while maintaining expected occupants\u2019 comfort. Table 5 presents the summarized performance results for strategies 1\u20134 with different filter levels. It is evident that the proposed strategy remains effective across all filter levels. It is important to note that higher filter levels result in increased fan energy usage due to the higher pressure drop that the fan must overcome. 4.3 Discussions on benefits of the proposed strategy for switching normal and pandemic operation in the post-pandemic era (1) High performance The proposed strategy can achieve effective infection control without excessive energy use while maintaining expected occupant comfort. The holistic high performance of the proposed strategy demonstrates its suitability for HVAC operation in future sudden pandemic scenarios. (2) No need for equipment retrofits For the commonly-used strategy of increasing fresh air supply, some systems may face limitations in introducing more outdoor air than usual due to the capacity constraints of existing equipment. To meet increased outdoor air requirements, it would be necessary to enlarge the sizes of AHUs, fresh air fans, and chillers. These retrofits are complex, labor-intensive and costly. In contrast, the proposed strategy only requires modifications to the system control logic, eliminating the need for extensive equipment retrofits and making it more convenient to implement. Particularly for systems with limitations in introducing additional outdoor air, the proposed strategy may be the best choice for operation during pandemic periods if the system operator wants to avoid extensive retrofits. (3) Easier implementation compared to advanced methods The proposed strategy does not require complex computations associated with solving intricate optimization problems in model predictive control or extensive data training processes required by data-driven approaches such as reinforcement learning. Although it may be more complex than the trim-and-respond logic in ASHRAE Guideline 36, it remains easier to implement compared to these advanced methods, making it a more accessible option for integration to existing HVAC control systems. 5 Conclusions The proposed control strategy can optimize the real-time operation of HVAC systems in pandemic scenarios. Test results show that the supply air temperature (SAT) reset scheme of the proposed strategy steadily adjusts the SAT to its highest feasible level according to actual cooling and humidity loads, thereby increasing recirculated airflow to enhance filtration effects for infection mitigation. The water-side control scheme coordinates efficiently with the SAT reset scheme, which utilizes chilled water at the highest possible temperature to increase chiller COP for enhanced energy efficiency. Comprehensive validation results demonstrate that the proposed strategy excels in both energy-efficiency and infection control. Compared to the normal operation strategy, it significantly reduces indoor infection risk without increasing energy consumption and may even achieve slight energy savings, while maintaining expected occupants\u2019 comfort. This study presents a solution for HVAC operation during pandemics that does not necessitate extensive retrofits to the system equipment but only requires adjustments to system control logics. It can be easily implemented by simply switching the system control logic from the normal control strategy to the proposed pandemic control strategy at the software level with a single click. The proposed strategy is well-suited for HVAC system operation in the post-pandemic era, particularly for systems that face limitations in introducing additional outdoor air due to capacity or design constraints. It enables HVAC systems to transition promptly and conveniently to a new operation scheme focused on mitigating disease transmission in response to unforeseen pandemic events in the future.

        "dc:description": "The lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic emphasize the need for building HVAC systems to be adaptable and prepared to adjust their operation for infection risk mitigation for future pandemics. Most guidelines suggest increasing outdoor air fraction in HVAC systems during pandemics. However, this approach is not energy-efficient due to the conditioning of additional outdoor air, and many practical systems face limitations in introducing more outdoor air than normal due to capacity or design constraints. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an alternative solution for HVAC system operation during pandemics that is energy-efficient, can effectively mitigate infection risks and does not require extensive retrofits to existing systems. To meet this need, this study proposes a practical real-time control strategy for high-performance HVAC operation in response to potential pandemic outbreaks. First, a supply air temperature (SAT) reset scheme for infection risk mitigation is proposed based on Mamdani fuzzy inference theory. Then, a coordinated control scheme is proposed to coordinate SAT reset with chilled water temperature adjustment for energy-efficiency enhancement. This strategy does not require system equipment retrofits but only changes in control logic to transition to pandemic operation. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is validated in a high-fidelity Modelica-based simulation environment under various weather conditions. Results show that, compared to normal operation, the proposed strategy can significantly reduce new infection cases by 32∼46 % without increasing energy use, and may even achieve slight energy savings of 9∼13 %, while maintaining expected occupant comfort.",
