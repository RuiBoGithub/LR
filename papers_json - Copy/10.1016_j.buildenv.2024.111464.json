Control strategies for variable air volume (VAV) air-conditioning systems play a pivotal role in ensuring indoor environmental quality and energy efficiency. However, conventional approaches, such as static pressure reset (SPR) control, focus on managing indoor air temperature without considering the room pressure, which can lead to unbalanced room pressure and undesirable air leakage. Moreover, with the application of prevalent building pressure control strategies, such as airflow tracking control, to multizone VAV systems, neutralization of the room pressure is difficult across multiple zones in VAV systems. Therefore, this study introduces a model-based optimal control strategy for multizone VAV air-conditioning systems. The proposed strategy uses a multiobjective optimization framework to regulate fan frequencies and damper openings on both the supply and return sides. This holistic approach facilitates the simultaneous control of the indoor air temperature and room pressure while minimizing fan energy consumption. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, four control strategies were tested using a Python-based simulation testbed. The results demonstrate that the proposed strategy effectively maintains the indoor air temperature, neutralizes room pressure, and reduces fan energy consumption, thereby contributing to the overall efficiency of the VAV system. Moreover, the results highlight the limitations associated with combining airflow tracking control with SPR control for room pressure regulation in multizone VAV systems. This highlights the importance of adopting a model-based approach to address the complexities of concurrent room pressure and indoor air temperature control.

This underscores the significant impact of indoor environment quality (IEQ) on both physical and mental wellbeing, as well as overall work efficiency. Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems play a crucial role in maintaining IEQ, encompassing indoor air quality (IAQ) as well as thermal comfort. Simultaneously, the building sector constitutes nearly 40% of the global energy consumption and contributes to approximately 30% of CO 2 emissions, where HVAC systems are the principal contributors to energy utilization [4,5]. In HVAC systems, the supply air (SA) in variable air volume (VAV) systems is adjusted in response to varying heat loads to maintain a consistent indoor air temperature. Furthermore, due to their exceptional energy efficiency and thermal comfort benefits, VAV systems are widely adopted. An important control technique in VAV systems is constant static pressure control, which often employs two proportional\u2013integral (PI) controllers. The PI controllers regulate damper positions based on deviations in the indoor air temperature based on a predefined set point and adjust the fan speed according to deviations in the static pressure in the air duct. Conventionally, the static pressure set point remains persistently high to ensure ample airflow for the most demanding terminals, resulting in substantial energy wastage and heightened system noise owing to the predominantly partial- load operations of VAV systems [6]. A compelling strategy to mitigate this drawback involves resetting the static pressure in the duct system, yielding potential electrical power savings that may exceed 50% compared with other supply fan control methods [7]. This static pressure reset (SPR) strategy entails readjusting the static pressure set point to a lower value when the terminal box damper position decreases, maintaining the damper in its widest opening status to minimize the system resistance and fan power consumption [8,9]. Such optimization can be achieved by integrating feedback from the terminal box status or other sources, i.e., the external temperature and overall airflow rate [8,10]. Considering that the terminal damper position feedback directly influences the system resistance and SA static pressure, control methods centered on damper position feedback have been widely adopted for resetting the static pressure [11]. However, the process of resetting static pressure necessitates the modulation of fan speed, which is commonly achieved via a variable frequency drive (VFD) equipped with a built-in proportional\u2013integral\u2013derivative (PID) controller [10], and the calibration of the gains of the PID controller can be complicated. Control performance often deteriorates or even becomes sluggish and oscillatory when the operating conditions diverge from the parameters used during controller tuning [12,13]. Moreover, inadequate tuning of the PID controller parameters may lead to the issue of hunting, causing erratic behavior [14]. Several previous studies have addressed these limitations. Taylor [15] introduced the \u201cTrim & Respond\u201d (TR) approach, which relies on gradual and regular adjustments to the pressure setpoint based on zone pressure requests. Although more effective than PID logic, this method exhibits a relatively sluggish response to dynamic load variations and zone VAV box requirements. To enhance responsiveness, subsequent enhancements were made to the TR strategy through the incorporation of a \u201ctrim booster\u201d and a \u201crespond booster\u201d in [16]. Rahnama et al. [9] proposed a new method based on the directly measured static pressure at each terminal by comparing the fan supply air volumes of the previous and present times, thereby allowing immediate adjustments to the pressure set-point upon airflow reduction. However, these SPR control strategies still involve resetting the static pressure set point based on feedback signals obtained from measured values or selected indicators within specific critical zones or several zones. When applying these methods in multizone systems, they may encounter the challenge of unbalanced ventilation [17]. In addition, these approaches confine their search for solutions to a localized solution space by relying on historical fan and damper states. Consequently, this localized approach ignores the potential for comprehensive optimization involving both the fan speed and damper positions, resulting in suboptimal solutions [18]. Model-based optimal control has emerged as a widely explored avenue in the HVAC field [19,20], including in VAV air-conditioning systems [21\u201323]. The core objectives of control optimization problems in this context involve two critical aspects: the ability to predict system responses based on a well-developed system model, and the utilization of appropriate optimization algorithms to search for optimal control variables in accordance with the responses of the system. This model-based approach offers an effective means of addressing issues such as unbalanced ventilation and lack of joint optimization. Specifically, Chen et al. [24,25] developed a computational model of an air duct system and obtained the optimal damper positions corresponding to the desired airflow distribution by solving an optimization problem. Wang et al. [18] presented an innovative optimal dynamic duct static pressure approach for multizone VAV systems. By transforming the initial nonconvex optimization problem into an equivalent convex optimization problem, the globally optimal fan speed and damper positions were determined. This strategy contributed to energy savings of approximately 20% and exhibited greater potential for the integration of the duct network model in the control framework. The literature survey underscores the potential of current research endeavors to enhance the control performance and energy efficiency of VAV systems. However, several research gaps remain. \u2022 Neglecting the return side: Current investigations focus on optimization control strategies for the supply side of VAV systems, usually encompassing a supply fan and VAV terminal dampers. However, the return side has largely been overlooked, leaving a significant degree of freedom in VAV systems and an untapped realm for potential optimization. \u2022 Not addressing imbalance room pressure and air leakage: Existing control strategies are yet to consider unbalanced room pressure and air leakage concerns. Considering that buildings are not hermetically sealed, mechanical ventilation-driven pressure disparities between indoor and outdoor environments can lead to air leakage. Changes in fan frequency or damper positions can further influence room pressure. Despite notable efforts to enhance airtightness in an experimental building, which is the objective of this study, air leakage has been observed in operational scenarios [26]. This becomes a pertinent issue, as air infiltration can compromise IAQ, diminish thermal comfort, promote moisture-related damage, and escalate energy consumption [27]. In contrast, air exfiltration results in difficulty with doors at entrances and exits and noise, in addition to condensation on cold surfaces inside walls during the heating season. Therefore, the development of a control strategy capable of maintaining neutral zone pressure to mitigate air leakage is required. A common method for building static pressure control involves utilizing a differential pressure (DP) sensor. This sensor consists of a high-pressure port with tubing extending to the interior space and a low-pressure port with tubing extending to the exterior of the building. Subsequently, the exhaust fan or damper is regulated based on the pressure difference [28]. As the cost of reliable airflow sensors decreases, another commonly utilized indirect approach, known as airflow tracking control, becomes feasible. This method involves maintaining a pre-set differential between the return and supply airflow rates, offering greater stability by circumventing pressure fluctuations [29]. However, although this approach is effective in single-zone VAV systems, its efficacy in guaranteeing room-pressure neutralization in multizone VAV systems remains uncertain. Motivated by the aforementioned research gaps, this study explored the concurrent control of indoor air temperature and room pressure. Moreover, the key objective is to achieve minimal air duct resistance caused by dampers to curtail the fan energy consumption. The main contributions of this study are summarized as follows. \u2022 Leveraging the proven efficacy of model-based optimization methods in enhancing various HVAC system performances, including those of VAV systems, this study develops a detailed physical model of a multizone VAV system, which can predict the air flowrate and pressure distribution in the whole system. Grounded in the airflow\u2013pressure relationship within the ducts, this model is validated through comparison with measured experimental data. This model empowers precise control over local controllable variables, including fan speed and damper positions, rather than relying on set-points, thereby enhancing control performance for optimal outcomes. \u2022 A multiobjective optimization framework is proposed for a multizone VAV system to concurrently achieve indoor thermal comfort, neutralize room pressure, and minimize fan energy consumption. To attain these diverse objectives, the framework considers the joint optimization of fan speed and damper positions for the supply and return sides of the duct system to reset the static pressure in the system at every optimal control step. \u2022 The combination of static pressure reset control with airflow tracking control indicated that the neutralization of room pressure in a multizone VAV system cannot be guaranteed by balancing total supply and return airflow or outside and exhaust airflow rates. Simultaneously controlling room pressure and indoor air temperature using this combined method demands substantial effort and may pose a challenge in testing and fine-tuning process. These challenges underscore the compelling need for a model-based approach in this context. The efficacy of the proposed optimal control strategy for multizone VAV air-conditioning systems was assessed based on a comprehensive evaluation of four control strategies. A Python-based simulation platform was developed to facilitate the validation test and comparative analysis of a multizone VAV air-conditioning system encompassing six rooms. 2 Multizone VAV system model To achieve concurrent control over the indoor air temperature and room pressure, a detailed physical model of a multizone VAV system needs to be developed. This model should simulate the response of the indoor air temperature, room pressure, and energy consumption to variations in the control variables. This section presents the development of the multizone system model. 2.1 Description of the VAV system The target VAV system was installed in an experimental building located in Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan. As shown in Fig. 1, the system comprises an air handling unit (AHU) with a SA fan. The system included an exhaust air (EA) fan, a VAV box located at the entrance duct of each room, and manually operated volume dampers (VD) at the entrance and exit ducts of each room. Furthermore, three VAV boxes, namely the outside air VAV (OAVAV), exhaust air VAV (EAVAV), and recirculated air VAV (RAVAV), are positioned at the outside air intake duct, exhaust air duct, and recirculated air duct, respectively. These components were interconnected through an air duct network, forming an integrated VAV ventilation system. 2.2 Component models of the VAV system This study focused on investigating the optimal control strategy for the secondary subsystem of the VAV system. Consequently, the modeling of the primary subsystem, which comprises components such as an air source heat pump (ASHP) and water pumps, was not considered herein. 2.2.1 SA and EA fans The SA fan serves as a power supply for the VAV duct network, generating both static and dynamic pressures to overcome resistance losses and distribute the conditioned air to various rooms. Conversely, the EA fan is dedicated to exhausting excess outdoor air under specific operational circumstances. Characteristic curves of SA and EA fans (Fig. 2) were derived from manufacturer data and fitted using a quartic polynomial, as expressed in Eq. (1): (1) Δ P s = a 0 + a 1 Q + a 2 Q 2 + a 3 Q 3 + a 4 Q 4 . Here, P s denotes the static pressure increase provided by the fan, Q denotes airflow rates, and a i denotes coefficients specific to each fan. The Newton\u2013Raphson method [30] was employed to calculate airflow rates from static pressure using the inverse function of Eq. (1). 2.2.2 VAV and RA dampers The VAV dampers were located at the entrance duct of each room, while return air (RA) dampers were located at the exit duct of each room. Adjusting damper openings can affect the static pressure and airflow rate within a duct network. The pressure drop across the damper was calculated using characteristic curves (Fig. 3). The percentage represents the degree of opening, where 0% denotes complete closure, and 100% denotes full openness. These curves were fitted to quadratic equations (Eq. (2)): (2) Δ P damper = K damper Q 2 , where K damper denotes the pressure loss coefficient of dampers. The characteristic curves of the VAV dampers were based on manufacturer data, whereas those of the RA dampers were assumed to be based on the scarcity of manufacturer and experimental data. 2.2.3 Duct network losses In a duct network, two types of losses are observed: friction and dynamics [31]. Friction losses occur owing to the shear stress associated with the fluid viscosity resulting from the relative movement of adjacent fluid layers at different velocities. These losses occur uniformly along the entire duct length and can be quantified using the Darcy\u2013Weisbach equation (Eq. (3)). (3) Δ P f = f l ρ v 2 2 d , where f denotes the friction factor, l is the duct length, d is the duct hydraulic diameter, ρ is the air density, and v is the average air velocity of the cross section. The friction factor f depends on the Reynolds number, duct roughness, or both, according to the flow region, and can be calculated using the Moody diagram [32]. Dynamic losses occur from flow disturbances caused by duct-mounted equipment and fittings, which can be computed using Eq. (4): (4) Δ P d = ξ ρ v 2 2 , where ξ is the local static resistance coefficient. The total pressure loss can then be determined by combining Eqs. (3) and (4): (5) Δ P duct = f ρ l 2 d A 2 + ξ ρ 2 A 2 Q 2 = K duct Q 2 , where A denotes the cross-sectional area of the duct and K duct denotes the coefficient of the total pressure loss in each section of the duct. To alleviate computational loads and approximate real-world conditions, K duct of each duct is computed once for a specific operating condition. 2.2.4 Air leakage loss The airtightness of the experimental building envelope underwent validation using the fan pressurization method, commonly known as the \u201cblower-door test\u201d, as detailed in a prior investigation [26]. The results of the depressurization test were employed to establish a quadratic relationship between the airflow and pressure loss (Eq. (6)). (6) Δ P leaks = K leaks Q 2 The pressure loss coefficients of each room, denoted by K leaks , are presented in Fig. 4. The terms \u201c0.5\u2013level\u201d and \u201cA4\u2013level\u201d in the figure signify the airtightness performance of buildings in windy areas or super high-rise buildings and high-rise buildings in the city, respectively, in accordance with Japanese industrial standards. This indicates that the experimental building attained a commendable level of airtightness. 2.3 Airflow\u2013pressure balance model In the modeling of the ventilation system, four fundamental terms were defined: node, branch, loop, and path. \u2022 Node: Nodes comprise diverging tees, converging tees within the duct network, points where the system interfaces with the outside air, and each zone within the system. These nodes are denoted using alphabetical labels ranging from \u201ca\u201d to \u201co\u201d, \u201cr1\u201d to \u201cr6\u201d, and \u201ci1\u201d to \u201ci6\u201d (Fig. 1). \u2022 Branch: Branches are components of the duct system that exist between any two nodes. For instance, \u201ca\u2013b\u201d and \u201cr1\u2013i1\u201d represent branches (Fig. 1). \u2022 Loop: Loops represent circular configurations within the duct system, comprising interconnected branches, e.g., \u201ca\u2013b\u2013j\u2013h\u2013a\u201d and \u201cb\u2013c\u2013r3\u2013k\u2013j\u2013b\u201d (Fig. 1). \u2022 Path: A path is a route extending from the starting point of the outside air node to the endpoint of the air leakage node, For example, \u201ca\u2013b\u2013c\u2013d\u2013e\u2013r1\u2013i1\u201d is an instance of a path (Fig. 1). By selecting ambient pressure as a reference, the pressure difference in each branch was calculated using Eq. (7). (7) Δ P = Δ P duct + Δ P s + Δ P damper + Δ P leaks When there are no fans, dampers, or air leakage nodes in a branch, the corresponding pressure difference is zero. With the pressure differences determined for each branch, the duct network can be analyzed using Kirchhoff\u2019s current law, satisfying the following two rules: \u2022 The airflow entering and exiting each node is equal. \u2022 The pressure change within each loop or path is zero. Under these conditions, the airflow rate balance could be resolved using the bisection method for various fan frequencies and damper openings. 2.4 Energy consumption model The energy consumption of the VAV system was divided into three parts: the ASHP, water pump, and SA and EA fans. The energy consumed by the ASHP was calculated using Eq. (8): (8) E ASHP = L cooling COP . Here, L cooling represents the cooling load of the ASHP, and COP denotes the coefficient of performance, which was assumed to be 3.5 in this study. Assuming no heat loss from the pipes and ducts, the cooling load comprises two parts: the heat generated by the supply fan and the heat load processed by the AHU coil. The heat load can be determined by calculating the enthalpy difference between the coil\u2019s inlet and outlet, with a presumed heat transfer efficiency of 1 for the coil. The calculation of L cooling is expressed in Eq. (9): (9) L cooling = E fan,sa + H OA + H RA − H SA , where E fan,sa denotes the energy consumed by the SA fan, H OA , H RA , and H SA denote the enthalpy values for the inlet outside air, recirculated air, and supply air, respectively. Furthermore, the power consumption of the SA and EA fans was determined using Eq. (10): (10) E fan = Q P v + P s η fan η fan . Here, the velocity pressure P v was determined using Eq. (11): (11) P v = 0 . 5 ρ Q A 2 . The fan and inverter efficiencies, denoted by η fan and η inv , respectively, were calculated using Eqs. (12) and (13), respectively. (12) η fan = e 0 , fan + e 1 , fan Q + e 2 , fan Q 2 (13) η inv = e 0 , inv + e 1 , inv Q + e 2 , inv Q 2 To obtain the coefficients e i , j for different fan frequencies, experiments were conducted to explore the relationship between airflow rate and power consumption. Subsequently, the relationship between the airflow rate and fan and inverter efficiencies was established using data-fitting methods, leading to the determination of e i , j coefficients (Fig. 5). For fan frequencies that are not part of the experimental dataset, additional coefficients can be obtained through linear interpolation. Because this study did not include a model for the water-side system, the power consumption of the water pump was assumed to be 1 kW based on the average value obtained from actual operational data. Considering these conditions, the overall system energy consumption can be described using Eq. (14): (14) E = E ASHP + E fan,sa + E fan,ea + E pump 2.5 RC model for building cooling load and indoor air temperature calculations To simulate the thermal dynamics of a building, a widely used gray-box model known as the resistance\u2013capacitance (RC) model was developed. This model is based on an electrical analogy that corresponds to thermal physics, and offers the advantage of rapid load calculations that encompass essential physical dynamics [33]. As depicted in Fig. 6, this single-zone model comprises a single internal thermal capacitor and five thermal resistors. The 5R1C model was developed based on the RC building simulator established by Jayathissa et al. [34], adhering to the ISO 13790 standard [35]. Although this model pertains to a single zone, its applicability is extended to a six-room experimental building by assuming that the internal surfaces in contact with other thermal zones are adiabatic regardless of the exchange. This assumption was based on two factors. First, incorporating thermal coupling between zones in a full-scale RC model introduces high-dimensional ordinary differential equations, which significantly increases the computational load for model-based optimal control [36]. Additionally, as the indoor air temperature set points for all six rooms were identical, the heat transfer between the zones was minimal. Consequently, modeling the six rooms as six independent zones using first-order models is an effective simplification. Furthermore, we enhanced the original model to consider indoor air temperature calculations, thereby incorporating the relationship between the supply air temperature and airflow rate and considering the effects of infiltration. Comprehensive details of this model are presented in Appendix. The elevation of the experimental building is shown in Fig. 7, the room information is detailed in Table 1, and the parameters pertinent to the 5R1C model are summarized in Table 2. 2.6 Validation of the developed airflow\u2013pressure balance model To validate the developed model, we compared the simulation results with measured data. The model used the measured fan frequencies and damper openings as inputs, and the outputs of the airflow rates were compared with the measured data. To validate the model comprehensively, we employed two different supply fan operation scenarios over two days. In one scenario, the supply fan operated at a constant speed to deliver the maximum required airflow, whereas in the other scenario, the supply fan operated at variable speeds to match the demand. For validation, the resistance coefficients of the duct network were separately optimized for these two scenarios to fit the corresponding measured data. Specifically, we optimized the resistance coefficients for a single time step; in our case, the data measured at 12:00 were used for fitting. These coefficients remained unchanged during operation of the VAV system for the entire day. A comparison of the measured and simulated supply and return airflow rates is presented in Fig. 8. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) metric was used to assess the accuracy of the model outcomes. Let y i represent the reference value of a specific variable (derived from measurements) at the i th time step, spanning n time steps: Additionally, y ˆ i denotes the predicted value of this variable according to the proposed model. MAPE is defined by Eq. (15). (15) MAPE = 1 n ∑ i = 1 n | y ˆ i − y i y i | Table 3 presents the analysis of the errors in the supply and return airflow rates. For constant-fan-speed operation, all MAPE values were minimal, with the largest being 0.70%. This suggests that the developed model accurately reproduces the real system operations. Conversely, under variable fan speed operation, relatively large MAPE values were observed, reaching a maximum of 10.02% in Room 202. This discrepancy is attributed to the considerable deviations during fan startup, induced by rapid and substantial frequency changes. The model assumes a steady state at each calculation step and does not precisely capture the time-delay characteristics of the VAV system. Nevertheless, the model effectively reproduced the airflow distribution under scenarios with gradual frequency changes. 3 Proposed optimal control strategy for the multizone VAV system 3.1 Outline of the proposed optimal control strategy Fig. 9 shows the optimal control strategy for multizone VAV air-conditioning systems, comprising two important steps: modeling and multiobjective optimization. The core of the modeling is the airflow\u2013pressure balance model (detailed in Section 2.3), which encompasses the component models described in Section 2.2. This model simulated the airflow rate and pressure distribution based on various fan frequencies and damper openings. The simulated airflow rate, in conjunction with the demand airflow rate obtained from the RC model outlined in Section 2.5, and air leakage rates forms the basis for the multiobjective optimization problem, as discussed in Section 3.2. This problem was solved using simulated annealing particle swarm optimization (SAPSO) (detailed in Section 3.3), which interacts with the airflow\u2013pressure balance model through operational parameter iterations. Subsequently, the optimized fan frequencies and damper openings are fed into the airflow\u2013pressure balance model, facilitating the calculation of the energy consumption using the model presented in Section 2.4 and the indoor air temperature using the RC model. 3.2 Multiobjective optimization scheme: objective function formulation The multiobjective optimization scheme aims to maintain the indoor air temperature and neutralize the room pressure across six rooms. This is realized by resolving a multiobjective optimization problem that involves optimizing the control variables, including the frequencies of the SA and EA fans and the openings of the VAV and RA dampers in each room. Using the weighted-sum approach, the multiobjective optimization problem is streamlined into a single-objective problem using the objective function expressed in Eq. (16). (16) J = J P + w J T Here, J P represents the objective related to the room pressure. Achieving a balanced room pressure across all rooms requires minimizing the air leakage, as shown in Eq. (17). In contrast, J T represents the objective of the indoor air temperature. The objective was to attain the defined set points in all rooms by minimizing the variance between the simulated and required supply airflow rates, as shown in Eq. (18). Moreover, J T can be formulated based on the temperature differences. However, this approach necessitates integration of the RC model into the optimization scheme, potentially increasing the computational load. Our simulation experiments indicate that formulating J T directly based on room temperature increased the optimization computation time by approximately 10%, and this time could further increase with higher-order RC models. The weighting factor, denoted by w , provides a balanced tradeoff between the room pressure and indoor air temperature during the optimization process. Determining an appropriate weighting factor involves the consideration of two key factors: the significance of each objective and the absolute numerical disparities between them [21,39]. In this study, both J P and J T tend to converge to values near zero, indicating their equal importance. Therefore, the weighting factor was determined based on the absolute numerical difference between the two objectives. (17) J P = ∑ i = 1 n | Q leaks , i | (18) J T = ∑ i = 1 n | Q sa , i − Q set , i | Here, Q leaks , i represents the air leakage in room i , with infiltration assigned a negative value, and exfiltration assigned a positive value. Q sa , i denotes the airflow rate supplied to room i . Q leaks , i and Q sa , i can be calculated by using the airflow\u2013pressure balance model. Q set , i denotes the required airflow rate in room i . In both equations, n corresponds to the number of zones, which was six. At each control step, assuming that air infiltration (as exfiltration does not affect the indoor air temperature) is zero and considering the outside air temperature, supply air temperature, and thermal mass temperature from the previous step, Q set , i can be calculated numerically using the 5R1C model. The Brentq method [40] is employed for this purpose. To minimize the energy consumption of the SA and EA fans, we introduced a penalty term into the objective function (Eq. (16)) rather than including the fan energy consumption directly, expressed as Eq. (19). (19) J = J P + w J T + λ This approach is considered because the fan energy consumption remains relatively high compared with J P and J T , which tend to converge to values near zero during the optimization process. Therefore, achieving a balance among these three terms by adjusting the weights can be challenging. The penalty parameter assumes a sufficiently large value when all VAV or RA damper openings are smaller than 85%, effectively reducing the system resistance, which translates to a lower energy consumption for the SA and EA fans. Moreover, when the damper openings are large, the change in the resistance coefficient is relatively small, thereby limiting the potential energy savings. Moreover, imposing closer opening ranges can complicate the process of determining optimal solutions. Hence, we used a threshold of not less than 85% to set the penalty parameter, thereby striking a balance between optimization and energy efficiency. 3.3 Multiobjective optimization scheme: SAPSO optimizer To solve the multiobjective problem, we used the SAPSO algorithm [41]. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) was initially introduced by Kennedy and Eberhart [42] and was inspired by the simulation of a simplified social system. PSO has found widespread application in optimizing HVAC systems [43] owing to its simple implementation and fast convergence. However, the primary challenge of PSO is premature convergence, in which particles can become trapped in local minima during the search process. This localization occurs because particles tend to gravitate toward local or near-local optima, resulting in their concentration in a small region and weakening the global exploration ability [41]. Simulated annealing, proposed by Kirkpatrick et al. [44], is a probabilistic technique designed to determine the global minimum of a specific objective function while attempting to escape the local minima during the search process. Theoretically, it has been confirmed that simulated annealing converges asymptotically to the global optimum solution with a probability of one [45]. However, simulated annealing may require a substantial amount of time to converge. Therefore, combining PSO and simulated annealing leverages the strengths of these techniques, leading to the generation of high-quality solutions in a short computation time. For further details, refer to [41]. In the SAPSO algorithm, six parameters need to be selected, namely: particle number ( N ), maximum iterative times ( I t e r Max ), initial temperature ( T 0 ), cooling parameter ( α ), largest weighting ( ω Max ), smallest weighting ( ω Min ), cognitive acceleration coefficient ( c 1 ), and social acceleration coefficient ( c 2 ), which can influence the performance of the optimizer. These six parameters were near optimized following the process described by [41]. This involved varying one parameter in each simulation. Once an appropriate parameter was identified, the process was repeated to determine the best fit for the next parameter. Given the complexity of determining the global minimum in our optimization problem, specifically in the early phases of parameter optimization, each parameter underwent 50 simulation runs and the best-performing parameter was selected to optimize the next parameter. Furthermore, to enhance the capability of locating the global minima, we incorporated the double linear decrease in the inertia weight proposed by Farooq et al. [46]. The optimized parameters are listed in Table 4. The upper and lower limits of the particles were set to match the operational constraints of fans and dampers. Specifically, the search range for particles regarding fan frequencies was set between 0.1 and 1, whereas that for damper openings was set between 0.2 and 1. These ranges remained consistent during the subsequent testing phases. 4 Simulation test arrangement 4.1 Test conditions In the test case, the multizone VAV air-conditioning system operated from 9:00 to 17:00, maintaining the indoor air temperature of 26 °C, with a consistent supply air temperature of 15 °C for all six rooms. The test was conducted under typical cooling conditions. The input conditions, including the outdoor air temperature, relative humidity, occupancy profiles, indoor heat loads, and solar heat gains, are presented in Fig. 10. In the tests using the proposed optimal control strategy, the weighting factor ( w ) was set to 0.4, based on previous simulation experiments, while the penalty parameter ( λ ) was fixed at 100. 4.2 Control strategies used in comparison tests Four control strategies (Strategies 1 ∼ 4) were tested and compared for multizone VAV air-conditioning systems, as described below. \u2022 Strategy 1 : Traditional SPR control applied in the experimental VAV system. As shown in Fig. 11, a PI controller is employed at every control step to regulate the damper opening, ensuring alignment between the calculated airflow rate and the specified requirements for each room. Subsequently, the frequency of the SA fan is adjusted to maintain the damper opening within the proper range, guided by the feedback from the VAV damper status. In instances where the maximum damper opening surpasses 95%, the SA fan speed is reduced; conversely, if it drops below 85%, the speed is increased. Using the analog to PI algorithm, the required airflow rate of each room Q req , i can be calculated using Eq. (20). (20) Q req , i = K P , i T set − T room , i + ∫ K I , i T set − T room , i d t + Q min , i Here, T set denotes the set point of the indoor air temperature (fixed at 26 °C for all six rooms), and T room , i represents the calculated indoor air temperature in room i , initially set to the natural environment temperature of 30 °C. The proportional gain K P , i is calculated using Eq. (21), and the integral gain K I , i is calculated using Eq. (22). Q min , i denotes the minimal supply airflow rate of room i . (21) K P , i = Q max , i − Q min , i Δ T , (22) K I , i = 1 T I , i , where Q max , i denotes the maximum supply airflow rate to room i , Δ T denotes the temperature variation range, T I , i is the integral time. To implement Eq. (20) in the simulation test, it needs to be discretized as a function of the simulation time step, as expressed in Eq. (23). (23) Q req , i = K P , i T set − T room , i + K I , i ∑ j = 1 m T set − T room , i + Q min , i The simulation time step is set to 5s; therefore, regarding 8 h operation, the total number of steps ( m ) would be equal to 5760. Moreover, the initial frequency ratio of the supply fan, denoted as I N V S A is calculated using Eq. (24). (24) I N V SA = I N V min , Q req,total ≤ Q req,min I N V max − I N V min Q req,total − Q req,min Q req,max − Q req,min + I N V min , Q req,min < Q req,total < Q req,max I N V max , Q req,total ≥ Q req,max Here, I N V min and I N V max represent the minimal and maximal frequency ratios of the supply fan, i.e., 10% (5 Hz) and 100% (50 Hz), respectively. Q req,min and Q req,max represent the minimal and maximal required supply airflow rates, which can be calculated using Eqs. (25), and (26), respectively. Q req,total represents the total required supply airflow rate, which can be calculated using Eq. (27). The supply fan frequency is adjusted every 12 simulation time steps (1-min interval) to ensure a stable system operation. (25) Q req, min = ∑ i n Q min , i (26) Q req, max = ∑ i n Q max , i (27) Q req,total = ∑ i n Q req , i Other parameters are listed in Table 5, with adjustments made through trial and error to ensure the rapid and stable realization of the desired indoor air temperature. The sampling time interval of the simulation may differ from a real-world operation, and parameters are adjusted accordingly. Furthermore, uncontrolled parameters, including the damper openings of OAVAV, EAVAV, and RAVAV and the frequency ratio of the EA fan, are summarized in Table 6. The damper openings of OAVAV, EAVAV, and RAVAV remain consistent in all the four test strategies. \u2022 Strategy 2 : Combined static pressure reset control and airflow tracking control. In this strategy, we combine the static pressure reset control of Strategy 1 on the supply side with airflow tracking control on the return side. Specifically, the supply side is regulated using the static pressure reset control same to Strategy 1. Simultaneously, the exhaust fan is controlled by airflow tracking to ensure that the exhaust air matches the outside air. According to the building pressure model described in Eq. (28), achieving equality between the exhaust and outside air leads to a building pressure of zero [29]. This strategy assesses the efficacy of the prevalent building static pressure control method when applied to a multizone VAV system. In contrast to Strategy 1, which solely controls the supply side, Strategy 2 controls the supply and exhaust sides, with the RA damper openings, identical to those in Strategy 1, set at 100%. (28) Q P = Q OA − Q EA Here, Q P represents the sum of air leakage that can reflect the state of the room pressure, Q OA is the outside airflow rate, and Q EA is the exhaust airflow rate. \u2022 Strategy 3 : Proposed concurrent control of room pressure and indoor air temperature. Optimization is applied to the supply and return sides, and the static pressure in the VAV system, including the room pressure, is reset via adjustment of the fan frequencies and damper openings at every optimal control step. Notably, the objective function does not incorporate the penalty term, ensuring that the maximal damper opening exceeds 85%. Consequently, the optimization variables encompass the frequencies of the SA and EA fans and the openings of the VAV and RA dampers in each room, resulting in a 14-dimensional optimization problem. The termination criteria for SAPSO are defined as follows: Absolute value of room pressure in all the six rooms must be less than 0.1 Pa, and the relative change between the calculated and demanded supply airflow rate in each room must be smaller than 5% of the demanded supply airflow rate. \u2022 Strategy 4 : The proposed complete optimal control strategy. In this strategy, we implement the comprehensive optimal control approach proposed herein. It closely resembles Strategy 3, with the key difference being the inclusion of the penalty term in the objective function to ensure that the maximal damper openings on the supply and return sides exceed 85%. All these strategies were simulated and tested with a testbed developed using Python. This testbed offers the advantage of high flexibility, thereby enabling seamless integration with various control and optimization algorithms. 5 Test results and performance comparison of different strategies This section presents an analysis of the performance of the multizone VAV air-conditioning system under the control of the proposed optimal strategy in the test case compared with the three reference control strategies. Given the differences in control intervals, with Strategies 1 and 2 operating at 5-s intervals, and Strategies 3 and 4 at 30-min intervals, we calculated the average values over a 30-min period for Strategies 1 and 2 to conduct a relevant comparative assessment. 5.1 Operational behavior of fan frequencies and damper openings Fig. 12 illustrates the operational behavior of the SA and EA fan frequencies, and VAV and RA damper openings of each room throughout the operational period (9:00 ∼ 17:00) for the control strategies. Strategy 1 controls the supply side. The SA fan was adjusted to maintain the widest open damper within an optimal opening range of 85% ∼ 95%. On the return side, there was no control, and the EA fan operated at its maximum speed using a fully open RA damper. Building on Strategy 1, Strategy 2 introduces a control for the EA fan to ensure that the exhaust air matches the external air. This led to a similar trend in the EA fan frequency as that of the SA fan. Strategy 3 optimizes both the supply and return sides, offering an optimal combination of fan frequencies and damper openings. It focuses on the demand\u2013supply airflow rate and does not consider the damper positions from the previous time step. However, suboptimal results can occur because of the stochastic nature of SAPSO. For instance, all the VAV damper openings at 13:30 and all the RA damper openings at 14:30 fell below 60%, thereby increasing the system resistance. Strategy 4 resolves the suboptimal issues encountered in strategy 3 by imposing constraints to ensure that the maximum damper openings on the supply and return sides exceed 85%. 5.2 Supply and return airflow rates and indoor air temperature in each room The supply and return airflow rates, along with the indoor air temperatures for different control strategies during the operating period of 9:00 ∼ 17:00 for the test case, are shown in Fig. 13. Strategy 1 controls the indoor air temperature, with air leakage indicated by the supply\u2013return airflow rate difference. Room 301, the furthest from the supply fan, exhibited exfiltration, whereas the other rooms demonstrated infiltration. Strategy 2 mitigates the supplyreturn airflow rate difference by incorporating EA fan control. Strategies 3 and 4 achieve close alignment and overlap between the return and supply airflow rates by optimizing the supply and return sides. While Strategies 1 and 2 maintain indoor air temperatures closer to the setpoint throughout the majority of the operation period than Strategies 3 and 4, refining the PI parameters can be time-consuming. Moreover, performance may degrade under changing operational conditions. 5.3 Room pressure and air leakage Fig. 14 illustrates room pressure and air leakage during the operational period (9:00 ∼ 17:00) in the test case using different control strategies. Strategy 1, which did not regulate the room pressure, exhibited the highest room-pressure imbalance (−22.04 Pa ) and air leakage (−198.71 m 3 / h ) among the four strategies. In the context of a single-zone VAV system, airflow tracking control can effectively maintain exhaust air equality with outside air, thereby neutralizing the room pressure and eliminating air leakage. However, when it is applied to the multizone VAV system described in this study (Strategy 2), while the total amount of the exhaust air equaled that of the outside air, full neutralization of room pressure cannot be ensured; even if the imbalance is reduced and the overall amount of air leakage is zero. Strategies 3 and 4 achieved near-neutralized room pressure and negligible air leakage by optimizing the supply and return sides. 5.4 Energy consumption The power consumption of the SA and EA fans and energy consumption of the entire VAV air-conditioning system during the operational period (9:00 ∼ 17:00) in the test case using different control strategies are shown in Fig. 15. Strategy 1 exhibited the highest fan power consumption and overall system energy consumption. Although Strategy 2 shows the lowest EA fan power consumption owing to the minimal resistance on the return side, its system energy usage is the second highest because the power consumption of the EA fan constitutes a small portion of the total power. However, Strategy 2 helps reduce the system energy consumption by 5.63% compared with Strategy 1, owing to decreased air infiltration. Strategy 3 achieved a 7.19% reduction in system energy consumption compared with Strategy 1 by effectively eliminating the heat gain from air infiltration. Strategy 4 exhibits the lowest supply fan power consumption and overall system energy usage among all the control strategies. It achieved a 6.71% reduction in fan power consumption and a 7.91% reduction in system energy usage compared with Strategy 1 by simultaneously eliminating the heat gain from air infiltration and reducing duct network resistance. 5.5 Summary of control performance using different strategies Strategy 1 represents a typical SPR control applied to experimental VAV air-conditioning systems to maintain the desired indoor air temperature. Strategy 2 integrates SPR control with airflow tracking control to ensure a balance between the exhaust and outside airflow rates. Strategy 3 adopts the proposed optimal control scheme to concurrently control the room pressure and indoor air temperature. Strategy 4 represents the proposed complete strategy, which aims to minimize fan energy consumption based on the concurrent control of room pressure and indoor air temperature. The performance of each strategy is summarized using the three assessment metrics presented below. \u2022 Indoor air temperature controllability: As shown in Fig. 16, all four strategies effectively maintained indoor air temperatures within a small deviation range (−0.2 ∼ 0.2 °C). Notably, Strategies 1 and 2 exhibited several larger deviations attributed to the relatively slow response of the PI algorithm during the initial phase of operation. In contrast, Strategies 3 and 4 outperformed Strategies 1 and 2 in achieving the indoor temperature set point by supplying more air to each room at the beginning of the operation. Furthermore, the performance of Strategies 1 and 2 is predominantly contingent on the fine-tuning of PI parameters, rendering them sensitive to changes in operational conditions. \u2022 Room pressure: As shown in Fig. 16, Strategy 1 exhibits the most significant room pressure imbalance, attributed to its exclusive control of the supply side. Strategy 2 can mitigate the pressure imbalance using the EA fan. Although an average neutral room pressure was achieved when ensuring equivalence between the total exhaust air and outside air, imbalances persisted across the room pressures of all six rooms. Strategies 3 and 4 demonstrate superior performance, achieving nearly neutral room pressure across all six rooms throughout the operation period. \u2022 System energy consumption: Strategy 1 exhibits the highest energy consumption among the four strategies. Strategy 2 demonstrates a reduction in energy use, attributed to decreased air infiltration and a lower exhaust fan frequency achieved through exhaust fan control. The performance of Strategy 3 surpasses that of Strategies 1 and 2, achieving minimal air infiltration with optimization of both the supply and return sides simultaneously. Strategy 4 shows further improvement through constraining of the damper openings, and realizes the minimum energy consumption. However, the energy savings of Strategies 3 and 4 are not markedly significant compared with that of Strategy 2, as Strategy 2 primarily reduced air infiltration, and exfiltration had no substantial impact on energy consumption. Notably, compared with Strategy 1, the energy-saving potential increases when the supply fan operates at a lower speed, potentially leading to negative pressure in all rooms and substantial air infiltration. Additionally, a larger temperature difference between indoor and outdoor air would also enhance the energy-saving potential. 6 Conclusion, limitations, and future work A model-based optimal control strategy for multizone VAV air-conditioning systems is proposed. The optimal strategy is based on system performance prediction using physics models and the SAPSO algorithm for optimizing fan frequencies and damper openings on the supply and return sides, where the indoor air temperature, room pressure, and fan energy consumption are considered simultaneously. A Python-based simulation testbed was developed and validated using the measured data to test and validate the proposed strategy by comparing it with different control strategies. The key conclusions drawn from this study are as follows: \u2022 The proposed optimal control strategy, i.e., the multiobjective optimization scheme, can effectively maintain indoor air temperature, neutralize room pressure, and minimize fan energy consumption. The results indicate that the optimal strategy can save approximately 6.71% and 7.91% of fan and whole system energy consumption, respectively, compared with those of the traditional static pressure reset control technique under a typical cooling operation condition. Eliminated heat gain from air infiltration and reduced duct network resistance mainly contribute to energy savings. Furthermore, this strategy can provide the benefits of avoiding moisture-related damage and undesirable drafts introduced via air infiltration, consequently extending the lifespan of buildings and improving the thermal comfort of occupancy. \u2022 The proposed optimal control strategy optimizes the combination of the control parameters of supply and return sides, including fan frequencies and damper openings. It helps achieve high accuracy regarding control performance, as the optimized variables can be directly transformed into signals used in actuators. This granular level control helped achieve a maximal room pressure of 0.05 Pa and a maximal indoor air temperature deviation of 0.25 °C. \u2022 The prevalent building pressure control method regulates the exhaust fan to ensure a fixed differential air volume between the exhaust and outside airflow [29]. However, by integrating this method into static pressure reset control and defining differential zero, neutralizing room pressure cannot be realized in multizone VAV systems. This scenario highlights the necessity of a model-based approach for the concurrent control of room pressure and indoor air temperature in complex multizone VAV systems. Although the proposed strategy demonstrates superiority over alternative approaches, its application to real-world systems has several limitations that deserve consideration in future studies. \u2022 In this study, we considered minimizing the energy use of fans by decreasing the damper-caused resistance and maintaining the room pressure at a near-neutral level to reduce air infiltration and exfiltration, which still exhibited a small amount of heat gain from infiltration. To achieve the minimum system energy consumption, we may need to maintain slightly positive room pressure to completely avoid infiltration, which may require additional supply air, leading to the additional energy consumption of the supply fan. This trade-off will be explored in the future. \u2022 The proposed strategy was tested considering a simplified scenario where input conditions, such as solar radiation, outdoor air temperature, and occupancy profiles, were changed at one-hour intervals. This simplistic representation may lack realism, and in addressing more rapid fluctuations in these disturbances, there is a need to further reduce computational load. Exploring solutions using the distributed approach [47] and the event-driven mechanism [48] is deemed desirable for solving the optimization problem under more dynamic conditions. \u2022 In this study, assuming time-independent model parameters may introduce uncertainties due to the transient nature of buildings with time-dependent characteristics [49]. To address this, desirable solutions involve utilizing real-time online building operating data to update parameters and employing robust optimization techniques to manage model uncertainties as recommended by [49,50].

Appendix Calculation procedure of the 5R1C model The equations expressed below are based on ISO 13790 [35] and the building simulator established by Jayathissa et al. [34]. These equations were modified to calculate the indoor air temperature by considering supply air and air infiltration. The temperature of the thermal mass ( T m ) in the room is expressed as follows: (A.1) C m d T m d t + T m ( H tr 3 + H em ) = ϕ m tot . Here, ϕ m tot represents an equivalent thermal heat flux and is defined as (A.2) ϕ m tot = ϕ m + H em T e + H tr 3 H tr 2 ϕ st + H w T e + H tr 1 T sup + H tr 1 H ve ( ϕ AC + ϕ infl + ϕ io ) , where C m denotes the thermal capacitance of the room, T e denotes the external air temperature, and T sup denotes the supply temperature of the ventilated air, which is assumed to be equal to the external air temperature considered in this study. The solar heat gains ϕ sol and internal heat gains ϕ int are represented by three equivalent heat fluxes: ϕ io , ϕ st , and ϕ m , which correspond to heat exchange with air ( T air ), internal room surfaces ( T s ), and the thermal mass ( T m ), respectively. The air-conditioning heat flux is represented by ϕ AC and the air infiltration heat flux is represented by ϕ infl , which can be calculated using (A.3) ϕ AC = c ρ Q sa ( T air − T sa ) , (A.4) ϕ infl = c ρ Q infl ( T air − T e ) . The five types of thermal conductances H are represented by three types of equivalent conductances: (A.5) H tr 1 = 1 1 H ve + 1 H is , (A.6) H tr 2 = H tr 1 + H w , (A.7) H tr 3 = 1 1 H tr 2 + 1 H ms . Here, H ve represents the ventilation conductance, which can be set to 0.0001 W / K when there is no outdoor ventilation [37]. H is denotes the conductance from the conditioned air to the interior zone surface; H w denotes the conductance to the exterior via glazed surfaces; H em denotes the conductance from the opaque surfaces to the exterior; and H ms denotes the transmittance from the internal air to the thermal mass of the zone. These conductance parameters can be calculated using the equations mentioned below, considering the thermal transmittance of wall U wal and window U win and the surface area of wall A wal , window A win , floor A flr , and surfaces facing the room A tot . (A.8) H em = U wal ∗ A wal (A.9) H w = U win ∗ A win (A.10) H ms = 9 . 1 ∗ 2 . 5 ∗ A flr (A.11) H ms = 3 . 45 ∗ A tot The internal heat flow rates caused by the internal gains and solar sources are divided between the thermal nodes as follows: (A.12) ϕ io = 0 . 5 ∗ ϕ int , (A.13) ϕ m = A m A t 0 . 5 ϕ int + ϕ sol , (A.14) ϕ st = 1 − A m A t − H w 9 . 1 A t 0 . 5 ϕ int + ϕ sol . Eq. (A.1) can be discretized using the Crank\u2013Nicolson method [51] for a given time step Δ t : (A.15) T m k + 1 = ϕ m tot + T m k C m Δ t − 0 . 5 ( H tr 3 + H em ) C m Δ t + 0 . 5 ( H tr 3 + H em ) . For the considered time step, the average values of node temperatures are given by (A.16) T m = T m k + T m k + 1 2 , (A.17) T s = H m s T m + ϕ s t + H w T e + H t r 1 T s u p + ϕ A C + ϕ i n f l + ϕ i o H v e H m s + H w + H t r 1 , and (A.18) T a i r = H i s T s + H v e T s u p + ϕ i o + ( ϕ A C + ϕ i n f l ) H i s + H v e . Using these equations, the indoor air temperature T a i r can be numerically solved. References [1] Klepeis N.E. Nelson W.C. Ott W.R. Robinson J.P. Tsang A.M. Switzer P. Behar J.V. Hern S.C.

        "dc:description": "Control strategies for variable air volume (VAV) air-conditioning systems play a pivotal role in ensuring indoor environmental quality and energy efficiency. However, conventional approaches, such as static pressure reset (SPR) control, focus on managing indoor air temperature without considering the room pressure, which can lead to unbalanced room pressure and undesirable air leakage. Moreover, with the application of prevalent building pressure control strategies, such as airflow tracking control, to multizone VAV systems, neutralization of the room pressure is difficult across multiple zones in VAV systems. Therefore, this study introduces a model-based optimal control strategy for multizone VAV air-conditioning systems. The proposed strategy uses a multiobjective optimization framework to regulate fan frequencies and damper openings on both the supply and return sides. This holistic approach facilitates the simultaneous control of the indoor air temperature and room pressure while minimizing fan energy consumption. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, four control strategies were tested using a Python-based simulation testbed. The results demonstrate that the proposed strategy effectively maintains the indoor air temperature, neutralizes room pressure, and reduces fan energy consumption, thereby contributing to the overall efficiency of the VAV system. Moreover, the results highlight the limitations associated with combining airflow tracking control with SPR control for room pressure regulation in multizone VAV systems. This highlights the importance of adopting a model-based approach to address the complexities of concurrent room pressure and indoor air temperature control.",
