Smart home energy management systems (SHEMS) can help users save on energy costs by controlling various household loads in response to environmental changes. However, human activity is closely related to household energy consumption, which can lead to potential energy waste. Additionally, smart homes often feature multiple types of distributed energy resources (DER), and how to leverage their potential for participating in grid scheduling without significantly impacting users remains an unresolved issue. This paper proposes an intelligent home energy management method based on human activity recognition (HAR) and deep reinforcement learning. By using activity recognition results derived from intrusive load monitoring (ILM), we categorize contexts into two groups. The agent employs the soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm for real-time control. In the first context, the goal is to ensure user satisfaction while reducing energy costs. In the second context, the focus is on controlling DER to participate in grid ancillary services to generate revenue. The proposed agent is trained using a real dataset, and simulations validate the effectiveness of the algorithm in home energy management.

In the 2022 Global Status Report for Buildings and Construction, the United Nations Environment Programme highlighted that in 2021, energy consumption in residential buildings accounted for 21% of global final energy consumption, ranking just behind industrial production (31%) and transportation (26%). Direct and indirect carbon dioxide emissions from residential buildings totalled nearly 600 million tons, contributing 17% of global carbon emissions [1]. A smart home energy management system (SHEMS) can utilize its adaptive control programs for demand side management (DSM), reasonably allocating energy to reduce building energy consumption levels. A survey indicates that in Japan, households equipped with home energy management systems experienced a 7.5% reduction in electricity consumption during winter [2]. This demonstrates that SHEMS has great potential in reducing energy consumption. Prior research has made significant strides toward optimizing smart home energy management. K. M. Tsui et al. studied a convex programming optimization framework for managing various appliances in smart homes [3]. Huang et al. proposed an optimal solution for operating household appliances under uncertain conditions using an enhanced particle swarm optimization algorithm [4]. Li et al. characterized home energy management as a multi-constraint mixed model and employed a genetic algorithm to identify the optimal strategy for managing home energy [5]. However, this approach treats home energy management as a sequential optimization problem, which can be challenging to implement in real-time scheduling scenarios. Furthermore, variations in daily activities and home environments across different users complicate the design of home energy management solutions tailored to specific situations. [6]. With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a method for identifying optimal strategies. Unlike purely reactive heuristic algorithm, reinforcement learning can adapt control strategies based on evolving objectives by learning the most effective actions through interactions with the environment, without requiring any model development [7]. Furthermore, reinforcement learning is particularly well-suited for multi-objective cost function planning over extended time horizons and real-time scheduling, making it highly appropriate for home energy management. RL typically comprises an agent and an environment. During learning, the agent interacts with the environment without prior experience, observes its state, takes actions affecting the environment, and receives rewards accordingly. Through iterative interactions, the optimization goal is to maximize cumulative rewards by following policy functions, enabling the agent to learn optimal control strategies gradually [8]. Zheng et al. proposed an RL-optimized energy management strategy for smart homes [9]. Xu et al. introduced a data-driven method using neural networks and Q-learning for scheduling household appliances [10]. However, these methods rely on traditional Q-learning, which stores action rewards for specific states in tables, facing challenges in scalability with large state spaces and discrete actions. To mitigate these issues, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged. Tai et al. addressed the stochastic nature of user behaviour with a multi-agent system for adaptive learning of household load preferences [11]. Liang et al. focused on minimizing smart home energy costs considering indoor comfort and environmental factors [12]. Wei et al. considered the continuous and discrete control variables in households and proposed a real-time energy management method based on deep reinforcement learning [13]. However, the aforementioned studies often rely on the assumption that heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems and appliances need to be kept on continuously to maintain indoor temperatures or to be available for scheduling. While this certainly increases user comfort, it may lead to potential energy waste. Human activities significantly contribute to energy consumption, Ignoring human behaviors can result in significant energy wastage [14]. Therefore, only by understanding the actual needs of users can more effective energy management solutions be developed. For instance, forgetting to turn off lights before bedtime can lead to unnecessary energy consumption despite efforts in demand-side management. Moreover, smart homes often incorporate various distributed energy resource (DER) such as thermostatically controlled loads (TCL), energy storage systems, and electric vehicles. Effectively managing these DERs for grid scheduling while minimizing user inconvenience remains a critical area for investigation. Thus, the application of human activity recognition (HAR) is vital for implementing effective demand-side management in smart homes. Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) measures household appliance usage through a single sensor (smart meter) and disaggregates this data via load disaggregation techniques. F. J. Ferrández-Pastor et al. proposed a NILM method utilizing wavelet transform and classified human activities using hidden Markov models [15]. Marisa Figueiredo et al. studied the step changes in electrical signals of household loads to perform load identification, which is then used for modeling household activities [16]. However, NILM primarily relies on event detection, where sampling frequency and accuracy are pivotal for effective load disaggregation, and it can only detect a limited number of appliances. Conversely, intrusive load monitoring (ILM) enhances efficiency and accuracy by incorporating distributed sub-sensors into devices or sockets to monitor individual energy consumption. Franco et al. proposed an ILM approach based on internet of things architecture for recognizing household activities, processing sensor data through machine learning classifiers [17]. To integrate HAR with smart home energy management, this study addresses the home energy management problem based on HAR. First, employing ILM, it establishes correlations between household energy usage and human activities through sensor data and user behavior analysis, identifying human activities related to energy consumption. Second, based on identified human activities influencing energy consumption, we categorizes contexts: context I involves human activities directly affecting household energy usage, whereas context II represents energy consumption occurring without direct human influence. Subsequently, considering user preferences and load characteristics in these contexts, corresponding Markov decision process (MDP) are designed and optimized using the soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm. The primary contributions of this paper are as follows: (1) We propose a HAR method based on ILM. By distinguishing household energy consumption attributable to human activities, we categorize the environment into two contexts: context I and context II. (2) We comprehensively consider user satisfaction and system economics by introducing an agent with a new state and reward function tailored to the smart home environment, aiming to optimize the operation of various load types within the smart home. (3) We propose a novel DER scheduling scheme that, for the first time, integrates the aggregation of distributed energy resources in smart homes to participate in system ancillary services. This scheme actively engages in economic dispatch within the distribution network, aiming to enhance system operational economics while minimizing user impact. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides an introduction to the system's structure and operation; Section 3 offers a detailed explanation of system model; Section 4 describes the MDP; Section 5 elaborates on Human Activity Recognition and the SAC deep reinforcement learning algorithm; and Section 6 discusses the algorithm's optimized performance on the dataset. 2 Problem formulation 2.1 System framework We introduced a structure for the SHEMS, as shown in Fig. 1 . This smart home is equipped with a rooftop photovoltaic system that harnesses renewable energy sources. It interacts with the grid at prices determined by the utility, enabling the home to buy or sell energy to/from the grid. Household loads are classified based on their operational characteristics into three categories: controllable loads, heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) loads, and non-controllable loads [18]. Controllable loads can adjust power consumption without compromising essential resident needs, such as microwave and range. HVAC loads consist of variable frequency-driven air conditioning systems with diverse power profiles. Non-controllable loads encompass devices crucial to resident necessities and appliances with fixed operational processes, such as those for food preservation, alarm systems, data collection systems, and other appliances that cannot be dispatched in this study. 2.2 System operation process As shown in Fig. 2 , in a smart home, a series of sensors collect environmental data and load parameters, which are processed and transmitted to the HAR module. This module detects energy consumption related to human activities by monitoring appliance usage and environmental changes. Based on the activity recognition results, the SHEMS selects the appropriate agent and implements the energy management strategy, which in turn influences the environment. 3 System model and analysis In this section, we provide a detailed explanation of the models for each part of the system framework. 3.1 Energy storage system Energy storage system (ESS) is defined as a component that receives scheduling signals from SHEMS to either store or discharge energy. In certain scenarios, it actively participates in selling energy to the grid and buying energy from the grid based on dynamic electricity price fluctuations [19]. The dynamic process of energy storage charging and discharging is as follows: (1) S t es = S t - 1 es + η es , c E t es , c Δ t - E t es , d Δ t η es , d In the Eq. (1), S t es \u200b represents the energy stored in the ESS at time t . η es , c and η es , d \u200b denote the charging and discharging efficiencies respectively. E t es , c and E t es , d represent the charging power and discharging power at time t , Δ t represents the time step. Additionally, we are given the constraints for the ESS: (2) 0 ⩽ E t es , c ⩽ e max es , c (3) 0 ⩽ E t es , d ⩽ e max es , d (4) S max es ( 1 - D o D ) ⩽ S t es ⩽ S max es (5) E t es , c · E t es , d = 0 Eq. (2) and Eq. (3) indicate that the charging power of the ESS is constrained by the maximum charging power e m a x es , c \u200b and the maximum discharging power e m a x es , d \u200b. Eq. (4) indicates that the ESS discharging process must occur within the depth of discharge range. Eq. (5) indicates that the ESS cannot charge and discharge simultaneously. Therefore, the power of the ESS is: (6) E t es = E t es , c + E t es , d The active charging and discharging processes of the ESS are as follows: (7) E t es = a e s e max e s , c a e s ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] a e s e max e s , d a e s ∈ [ - 1 , 0 ] In the Eq. (7), a es ∈ [ - 1 , 1 ] is the charging and discharging control coefficient of the ESS. Additionally, the State of Charge (SoC) of the ESS is defined as follows: (8) So C t es = S t es S max es 3.2 Renewable energy We opted not to employ a weather-based photovoltaic model for estimating power generation; instead, we directly utilized real photovoltaic generation data E t pv from the dataset. Additionally, we stipulate that the energy generated by the photovoltaic system must initially supply the household load. Any surplus energy beyond household needs is allocated to charging the ESS. Excess energy that the ESS cannot absorb is sold back to the distribution grid. 3.3 Electrical vehicle In this study, we exclusively focus on the Grid-to-Vehicle (G2V) process of electric vehicles. We assume that the charging power of electric vehicles can be adjusted within a specified range [20]. The dynamic process of electric vehicle charging and discharging unfolds as follows: (9) S t ev = S t - 1 ev + η ev , c E t ev , c Δ t In the Eq. (9), S t ev is the energy stored in the EV at time t , η ev , c \u200b is the charging efficiency, and E t ev , c \u200b is the charging power. The constraint regulation of electric vehicles is: (10) 0 ⩽ E t ev , c ⩽ e max ev , c (11) 0 ⩽ S t ev ⩽ S max ev Eqs.(10) and (11) represent the charging power constraint and capacity constraint of the EV, respectively. The SoC of the EV is defined as follows: (12) So C t ev = S t ev S max ev 3.4 Residential load 3.4.1 Controllable load For controllable loads, their actual load can vary continuously and must be maintained between the minimum and maximum power demand [21]: (13) e min con ⩽ E t con ⩽ e max con (14) E t con = a con e max con In the Eq. (14), a con ∈ [ e m i n con / e m a x con , 1 ] indicates that the power of controllable loads can balance electricity costs by reducing power demand during the period, where e m i n con \u200b represents the minimum power demand of the controllable load, and E t con represents the actual power of the controllable load. That is, the actual demand of the controllable load can be adjusted within a certain range according to the environment. However, reducing the actual load may cause user dissatisfaction. 3.4.2 Heating ventilation and air conditioning For HVAC loads, in reducing peak demand scenarios, HVAC systems can provide load adjustment services through strategies such as static pressure adjustment, supply water temperature reset, and frequency control [22]. Therefore, its power is a continuous variable ranging from 0 to the original power demand [23]. Due to HVAC's characteristics of maintaining constant temperature control loads, it is considered a typical thermostatically controlled load (TCL). Considering HVAC's heating and cooling modes separately, their impact on the environment can be expressed as: (15) E t env = a h v a c e max h e a t a h v a c ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] a h v a c e max r e f a h v a c ∈ [ - 1 , 0 ] In the Eq. (15), a hvac ∈ - 1 , 1 where this coefficient is positive for heating and negative for cooling. e m a x heat represents the maximum heating power of HVAC, and e m a x ref represents the maximum cooling power of HVAC. Therefore, the power of HVAC is: (16) E t hvac = E t env The role of HVAC is to maintain the indoor temperature within a reasonable range to ensure the comfort of the residents. The indoor comfort temperature range is: (17) T min ⩽ T t i n ⩽ T max In the Eq. (17), T m i n \u200b and T m a x represent the minimum and maximum comfortable indoor temperatures, respectively. When the indoor temperature is within the comfort temperature range, the residents' comfort level is at its highest. The indoor temperature at time t is given by the following equation [24]: (19) T t + 1 in = T t in e - Δ t / R m C m + R m E t hvac + T t out 1 - e - Δ t / R m C m In the Eq. (18), T t o u t \u200b is the outdoor temperature at time t , R m is the thermal capacity (°C / k W ), and C m is the thermal resistance ( k W h / °C). 3.4.3 Non-controllable load For non-controllable loads, their demand must be met during the home energy management process, and they must operate continuously without adjustment. Their power is E t ncon . 3.5 Distribution grid A smart home (SH) is connected to a regional distribution grid as a backup. Due to the unpredictable nature of renewable energy sources, relying solely on distributed renewable energy may not always suffice to meet the SH's energy demand. Hence, the regional distribution grid can supply power to the SH when its own energy generation is insufficient or receive excess energy from the SH when there is a surplus. The prices for energy transactions between the distribution grid and the SH are denoted as the down regulation price P t b and up regulation price P t s , set by the electricity supplier in the balancing market based on trading conditions. Both the regional distribution grid and the smart home share these prices P t b \u200b and P t s \u200b. To ensure economic efficiency for the SH, the SHEMS only procures energy E t grid from the grid when its energy storage cannot meet the demand. Conversely, it only sells surplus energy \u200b E t grid to the grid when the storage system cannot absorb it. Therefore, the SH's energy demand and supply can be expressed as: (20) E t ED = E t con + E t hvac + E t ncon + E t ev (21) E t ER = E t pv + E t es - E t ED 3.6 Supply and demand balance function Considering the integration of the energy storage system, renewable energy sources, electric vehicles, household load model, and regional distribution grid, the comprehensive energy balance equation for the system is as follows: (22) E t pv + E t es + E t grid = E t con + E t hvac + E t ev + E t ncon The Eq. (22) describes the profit or cost generated from energy transactions between the user and the distribution grid: (23) r t home = P t s E t g r i d Δ t E t g r i d ⩾ 0 P t b E t g r i d Δ t E t g r i d ⩽ 0 In the Eq. (23), r t home is positive when it represents the revenue from selling energy to the distribution grid, and negative when it represents the cost of purchasing energy from the distribution grid. 4 MDP formulation In this section, we will describe the scheduling decision process of the SHEMS using a Markov decision process (MDP). A MDP is a mathematical framework used to model sequential decision-making problems involving uncertainty. A MDP is typically characterized by five parameters ( S , A , P , R , γ ) : State space S : The set of all possible states. Action space A : The set of all possible actions the agent can take. The agent selects an action based on its policy to influence the environment. Transition probability P : Describes the probability distribution of transitioning to a new state after taking an action in a given state. It is usually represented as P ( s \u2032 | s , a ) , where s is the current state, a is the action taken, and s \u2032 is the new state. Reward function R : Defines the immediate reward the agent receives when it transitions to a new state after taking a specific action in a given state. It is represented as R ( s , a , s \u2032 ) . Discount factor γ ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] : A value indicates how much the agent values future rewards. 4.1 Context I: Detected energy consumption related to human activities In this context, the activity recognition module plays a crucial role in identifying human activities that impact energy consumption. Therefore, the SHEMS intelligently plans and controls various smart home appliances and adjusts the charging process of EV. This aims to enhance the economic efficiency of the system while ensuring user satisfaction. The specific process involves SHEMS sensing distribution network prices, integrating system constraints, considering current renewable energy generation, energy storage levels, user comfort feedback, and electric vehicle battery levels. It dynamically adjusts the power consumption of controllable loads, HVAC systems, and electric vehicle charging. Priority is given to meeting users' electricity demands while assisting them in effectively managing energy costs. Consequently, under such circumstances, the ESS will not actively participate in selling or purchasing energy from the distribution network. Instead, it focuses on optimizing internal energy usage to maintain system stability and efficiency. 4.1.1 State space The state space in context I of SHEMS consists of information used by the agent in each time step of the decision-making process. Therefore, the state information in SHEMS is composed of internal state variables S X and external state variables S Y . Internal state variables include the maximum loads of controllable power e m a x con \u200b, HVAC load E t hvac \u200b, EV charging power E t ev \u200b, state of charge of electric vehicles SoC t ev \u200b, SoC of ESS SoC t es \u200b, and indoor temperature T t i n \u200b, which are directly or indirectly affected by the agent's outputs. External state variables include uncontrollable variables that the agent cannot control, such as current time t , renewable energy generation power E t pv \u200b, non-controllable loads E t ncon \u200b, a Boolean variable B t ev indicating whether the user is driving an electric vehicle home for charging, outdoor temperature T t o u t \u200b, up regulation price P t b \u200b, and down regulation price P t s \u200b. Therefore, the state space for context I can be represented as: (27) S t I = t , E t pv , e max con , E t hvac , E t ncon , E t ev , B t ev , S o C t ev So C t es , T t in , T t out , P t b , P t s 4.1.2 Action space The action space consists of three components based on the model mechanism proposed in Section 3, applied to the environment. These components are: Control coefficient a con \u200b for controllable power loads. Control coefficient a hvac \u200b for HVAC. Control coefficient a ev for EV charging. Therefore, the action space is: (28) a t I = a con , a hvac , a ev 4.1.3 Reward function The setup of the reward function impacts the learning effectiveness of the agent. Aligned with our objectives, we have designed the reward function to ensure that the SHEMS enhances the economic efficiency of the microgrid, adheres to operational constraints, ensures user satisfaction, and improves the economic performance of the SH. The reward function consists of four components. The first component addresses the electrical cost, as described in Eq. (23), reflecting the economic aspect of the system. The reward coefficient k 1 defines the balance we aim to achieve between maximizing system economic efficiency and ensuring user comfort. (29) r t pft = k 1 r t home The second part of the reward function describes the impact of reducing controllable power loads on user experience. The reward coefficient k 2 \u200b governs whether SHEMS prioritizes consuming more energy to enhance user satisfaction. (30) r t dissat = k 2 E t con - e max con The third part of the reward function assesses the comfort level of indoor temperature, where user satisfaction peaks when the indoor temperature remains within a comfortable range. Within this range, the reward remains at 0. However, penalties are applied if the temperature deviates too low or too high. The reward coefficient k 3 determines whether SHEMS prioritizes consuming more energy through HVAC to sustain the indoor temperature within this comfortable range [25]. (31) r t temp = k 3 ( [ T t in - T max ] + + [ T min - T t in ] + ) The fourth part of the reward function addresses the user's requirements for EV charging. Upon arriving home, users prefer the EV to charge quickly to achieve a baseline charge level for immediate use. Additionally, users prefer the EV to have as much charge as possible. The reward coefficient k 4 governs whether SHEMS prioritizes increasing the EV charging power to promptly meet user demands and alleviate user anxiety. (32) r t anx = k 4 [ ( S o C t ev - S o C base ev ) 2 + ( 1 - S o C t ev ) ] In the Eq. (32), SoC base ev \u200b represents the baseline SoC necessary for the normal operation of the EV. Therefore, the total reward that the agent in context I can obtain each time it interacts with the environment is: (33) R t I = r t pft - r t dissat - r t temp - r t anx 4.2 Context II: No energy consumption related to human activities detected In this context, where the activity recognition module detects no human activities impacting energy consumption, SHEMS will utilize DER within the smart home for peak shaving and valley filling activities. It will engage in system ancillary services based on regulation prices provided by the distribution network, aiming to capitalize on arbitrage opportunities. Specifically, SHEMS will monitor distribution network prices and integrate system constraints to optimize the use of DER such as ESS, TCL, and EV to exploit differences between peak and off-peak electricity prices and subsidies for ancillary services [26,27]. Meanwhile, all controllable power loads will operate at minimum power levels to minimize potential energy waste. During peak electricity pricing periods, energy storage will be encouraged to discharge, HVAC systems will flexibly adjust output power or shut down, enabling EV to reduce charging power or delay charging. During off-peak pricing periods, energy storage will be encouraged to charge, HVAC systems will be turned off to save energy or initiate pre-cooling, and EVs will increase charging power. 4.2.1 State space Similar to context I, the state information in context II consists of internal state variables S X and external state variables S Y . Internal state variables include HVAC power E t hvac \u200b considered as TCL, electric vehicle charging power E t ev \u200b, SoC of the EV SoC t ev \u200b, ESS power E t es \u200b and SoC SoC t es \u200b. External state variables include current time t , renewable energy generation power E t pv \u200b, total of non-controllable loads E t ncon \u200b and minimum operating power of controllable loads E t con \u200b E t tp \u200b, a Boolean variable B t ev indicating whether the user is driving an electric vehicle home for charging, up regulation price P t b \u200b, and down regulation price P t s \u200b, the current moment P t b \u200b minus the average price of the day ahead, denoted as P t diff . Therefore, the state space of context II can be represented as: (34) S t II = t , E t pv , E t tp , E t hvac , E t ev , E t es , B t ev , S o C t ev , S o C t es , T t in , T t out , P t b , P t s , P t diff 4.2.2 Action space The agent utilizes the model mechanism proposed in the section 3 to interact with the environment. The action space consists of three parts: the power control coefficient a hvac \u200b for HVAC, the power coefficient a ev \u200b for EV, and the charge/discharge control coefficient a es \u200b for ESS. Therefore, the action space is defined as: (35) a t II = a hvac , a ev , a es 4.2.3 Reward function In context II, the reward will consist of three parts. The first part is the profit obtained from selling electricity by DER based on peak-to-valley price differentials: (36) r t pft = b 1 r t home The second part describes the subsidies obtained by DER from electricity suppliers through providing ancillary services [28,29]. In order to incentivize distributed energy resources to release more electricity periods, the difference between the current moment price and the price P t diff is used as a criterion for evaluating their participation in peak shaving and valley filling [30]. They release more electricity during high-price periods and absorb more during low-price periods. (37) P t diff = P t b - ∑ t = 1 24 P t dap / 24 (38) r t sub = b 2 E t g r i d P t d i f f E t g r i d P t d i f f > 0 0 e l s e In the Eq. (38), E t grid P t diff \u200b, when P t diff > 0 , distributed energy resources release more energy, which qualifies for higher subsidies. Conversely, during off-peak times P t diff < 0 , more energy is absorbed. The third part is similar to the formula, describing the user's requirement for the current charge during the electric vehicle charging process, but with a smaller reward coefficient b 3 \u200b in this case. (39) r t anx = b 3 [ ( S o C t ev - S o C base ev ) 2 + ( 1 - S o C t ev ) ] Therefore, the total reward that the agent can obtain each time it interacts with the environment in context II is: (40) R t II = r t pft + r t sub - r t anx 5 Har-based SAC algorithm In this section, we propose a SAC algorithm based on HAR for household energy management. Firstly, we introduce a household activity recognition method based on ILM, which links household energy consumption with human activities, identifying eleven types of household activities and categorizing them into two contexts. Then, we establish actor and critic networks to learn the approximate values of the value function and policy function for each context. The complete algorithmic process is illustrated in Fig. 3 . 5.1 ILM based HAR algorithm The proposed method utilizes ILM installed on household appliances and outlets to infer human activities related to energy consumption in the home. It consists of four core steps [31]: 1. Identifying household activities: Based on existing research findings and the known relationship between energy consumption and household activities, select key activities that represent typical household routines. 2. Data collection: Utilize sensors to collect load data from appliances and smart sockets. This data is then transferred through communication channels to a data processing centre for analysis. 3. Activity mapping: Establish the relationship between energy consumption and specific household activities. 4. Activity inference: Combine the collected load data with sensor data to determine which human activities are currently taking place in the household. 5.1.1 Identify household activity Firstly, we define the activities involved in HAR The European Statistical Office (Eurostat) provides a comprehensive list of activities that may occur within households [32]. Based on the scope of this study, we establish the following criteria: 1. We select only activities that take place inside the home, as the focus of our research is home energy management. Therefore, activities occurring outside the home, such as attending school or traveling, are excluded. 2. We select only activities with a clear relationship to household energy consumption. Since our goal is to implement the proposed energy management strategy in two scenarios based on activity recognition results, activities like sleeping or eating, which do not directly influence energy consumption, are excluded. 3. We do not consider activities powered by mobile sources, such as using a smartphone or cleaning with a rechargeable vacuum cleaner, as our proposed energy management strategy does not affect these activities during its execution. 5.1.2 Data collection In the home, ILM sensors collect power data for most appliances and outlets, while some temperature and water flow sensors are also deployed. We categorize the sensors as follows [33]: 1. Type I sensors: Deployed on fully manual appliances, their state changes only with user interaction. 2. Type II sensors: Deployed on partially automatic appliances, their state can be altered by user interaction but also includes some autonomous functions. 3. Type III sensors: Operate fully automatically without user interaction. For this study, we consider only type I and type II sensors for activity recognition. The appliance loads monitored by these sensors, along with temperature and water flow measurements from environmental sensors, are aggregated to a data processing centre via a communication channel and stored in.csv format. 5.1.3 Activity mapping To establish relationships between appliances and household activities, we introduce the concepts of main appliances, subsidiary appliances, and environmental feedback. The main appliance is the primary indicator of a specific activity, typically used exclusively for that activity or always involved in it. Subsidiary appliances assist in confirming the occurrence of an activity and may be selected for specific tasks. Environmental feedback refers to information from temperature and flow sensors; when a household activity causes significant environmental changes, this feedback helps in identifying the activity. For instance, when a resident is cooking, appliances like the oven and range hood may be in use. Using the stove or oven often results in notable changes in the kitchen's temperature, while cooking with a microwave may not. In this example, since multiple appliances can be used for cooking, there is no clear main appliance. The subsidiary appliances include the oven and microwave, while environmental feedback comes from the change in kitchen temperature. Activities often involve multiple appliances [34], and one appliance may be associated with several activities. For instance, cooking may involve several appliances simultaneously, while a sound system in the living room could be used for watching TV or listening to music. 5.1.4 Activity inference Activity inference will be performed by combining data from main appliances, subsidiary appliances, and environmental feedback. To integrate information from various sensors while accounting for uncertainty, we employ the layered-based structure [35]. As shown in the HAR module in Fig. 3, each black circle represents the power consumption of an appliance, obtained through intrusive load monitoring, while each blue circle represents a measurement from an environmental sensor. Main appliances, which correspond exclusively to specific activities, are indicated by solid lines, whereas subsidiary appliances or potential environmental changes related to certain activities are represented by dashed lines. The arrows indicate the inference process from sensors to activities. Table 1 outlines the correspondence between sensors and activities, and the detailed steps of the algorithm are provided in Table Table 2 . By following these steps, the HAR module can perform real-time detection based on feedback from both ILM and environmental sensors. 5.2 Soft actor-critic algorithm The SAC algorithm is an extension of the actor-critic algorithm, designed to address reinforcement learning problems discontinuous action spaces. It introduces entropy regularization to encourage exploratory behavior in the policy. This regularization helps maintain diversity in action selection, striking a balance between exploiting known effective policies and exploring new actions that could potentially lead to improved outcomes. Firstly, the agent initializes the SAC algorithm's policy network, critic network, target Q-network and replay buffer. The agent uses the current policy π ϕ \u200b to select an action a t . By interacting with the environment, the agent receives feedback, including the next state s t + 1 \u200b, reward r t \u200b, and termination signal d t \u200b. This experience ( s t , a t , r t , s t + 1 , d t ) is stored in the replay buffer. Subsequently, the agent samples a batch of data from the replay buffer. From the policy network π ϕ ( a | s ) , the agent samples the next action a t + 1 \u200b, computes its log-probability log π ϕ ( a t + 1 | s t + 1 ) , and calculates the target Q-value: (41) y = r t + γ 1 - d t min i = 1 , 2 Q θ i \u2032 s t + 1 , a t + 1 - α log π ϕ a t + 1 | s t + 1 Then, the agent updates the parameters of the critic Q-networks Q θ 1 \u200b\u200b and Q θ 2 using the mean squared error. The update process can be described as follows: (42) L θ i = E s t , a t , r t , s t + 1 , d t Q θ i s t , a t - y 2 The agent updates the parameters of the policy network π ϕ ( a | s ) by optimizing the policy to maximize the expected Q-values while considering entropy regularization. The update process targets the minimum of the two Q-networks, Q θ 1 and Q θ 2 \u200b\u200b, to ensure stability and avoid overestimation: (43) J ( ϕ ) = E s t ∼ D min i = 1 , 2 Q θ i s t , π ϕ s t - α log π ϕ π ϕ s t | s t The parameters of the target Q-network in the SAC algorithm are updated using a soft update approach: (44) θ i \u2032 ← τ θ i + ( 1 - τ ) θ i \u2032 In the Eq. (44), τ is the soft update coefficient. Finally, the agent uses a gradient descent method to automatically adjust the entropy coefficient α . The target entropy value is denoted by H , and α is updated using the following loss function: (45) L ( α ) = - E a t ∼ π ϕ α log π ϕ a t | s t + H 5.3 Proposed method Based on the analysis above, we propose an HAR-based SAC algorithm for intelligent home energy management. Initially, we recognize the close relationship between home energy consumption and human activities. Therefore, the HAR module utilizes ILM to gather appliance load data from the environment for activity recognition. Employing the activity recognition method outlined earlier, we identify common human activities. Temporally, we segment the environment into two contexts: context I, where energy consumption relates to human activities detected, and context II, where no human-related energy consumption is detected. For these contexts, corresponding MDP are established. During the training phase, data is collected through agent-environment interactions. Specifically, assuming a household fully adopting context I and context II, we set up environments for agent I and agent II based on the previously presented MDP. Subsequently, agent I and agent II utilize the SAC algorithm to maximize cumulative rewards by optimizing policy and value functions, while policy entropy automatically adjust to foster exploration. Throughout training, agents interact with the environment, accumulate experiences, and update their policies and values via experience replay. This iterative process enables agents to learn decision-making progressively. During execution, at each time step t , the HAR module determines whether to activate agent I or agent II based on the detected result. The agent observe current state of the environment s t \u200b, and an action a t is chosen, which is executed in the environment, leading to state transition to s t + 1 \u200b. The trained agents can be used for real-time scheduling. Table 3 pseudo code for this algorithm is outlined below: 6 Simulation and results In this section, we analyse the relationship between household energy consumption and human activities, simultaneously, we evaluate the HAR-based SHEMS management method proposed in this study. The software components are implemented using Python 3.19 and PyTorch 1.13 platforms, we utilize a computer with an AMD R9-5950X CPU and a NVIDIA RTX3060 GPU. The training parameters for the SAC agent using DRL are provided in Table 4 . 6.1 Performance in Honda smart home dataset 6.1.1 Simulation setup The dataset used is a real smart home dataset provided by Honda, involving a household of five members engaging in daily activities [36]. The data resolution is set at 1 min intervals, dividing each day into 1440 steps HAR based on sensor data in the environment and manages energy accordingly based on human recognition results. The overview of the smart home is provided in Table 5 . Training is conducted using data from July 2018, with model parameters specified in Table 6 . 6.1.2 Home energy consumption and human activity recognition Based on power measurement data from sensors deployed on home appliances and smart sockets, we studied the composition of household energy consumption and its correlation with human activities. Fig. 4 (a) shows the analysis of household energy consumption broken down by different load types, while Fig. 4(b) displays the energy consumption attributed to different human activities. It can be observed that the use of HVAC systems exhibits significant seasonality, typically occurring during summer and winter, whereas the use of electric vehicles mainly happens during climatically suitable times. Human activities are undoubtedly the primary factor leading to household energy consumption. Additionally, potential energy consumption caused by automated home appliances and standby devices which means non-human activities occupy a considerable proportion of household energy usage. Fig. 5 illustrates partial results identified using the HAR algorithm proposed in this paper on July 2nd. It can be observed that, due to user habits, energy consumption is relatively lower during the early morning hours. Cooking typically occurs around meal times and has a significant impact on ambient temperature. In the figure, the kitchen temperature variations and the average temperature of the ground floor have been smoothed using local weighted regression to better observe trends. Moreover, users may have multiple instances of doing laundry throughout the day, which usually includes washing followed by drying with a dryer. During the daytime, when temperatures are higher, users typically use HVAC systems to regulate indoor temperatures. These results demonstrate the necessity of employing home energy management methods to optimize the operation of different load types and reduce potential energy waste, while also illustrating the potential for distributed energy resources in smart homes to participate in distribution grid dispatching. 6.1.3 Algorithm learning performance From the Fig. 6 , it can be seen that the rewards obtained by the two agents gradually increase during the test. The rewards for agent I stabilize around 1200 episodes, while those for agent II stabilize around 4000 episodes. This indicates that the agents have learned effective control strategies and have reached the desired performance level. 6.1.4 Performance analysis of the algorithm We applied the trained agents I&II to the test environment, and the home energy management results for a day in the test set are shown in Fig. 7 . On the timeline, periods marked in light red represent context I, and those in light blue represent context II. Fig. 7(a) illustrates the buy price, sell price, and their average price per unit of electricity for the day, and Fig. 7(b) shows the rooftop renewable energy generation. As shown in Fig. 7(c), controllable loads operate at their lowest power level during context II, such as from 0:00 to 6:00, reducing potential energy waste. In context I, due to the decrease in ESS SoC and relatively high energy prices, controllable loads are slightly reduced after 19:30. The change of indoor temperature and outdoor temperature is shown in Fig. 7(d). As Fig. 7(e) shows, the air conditioner is turned off in context II to save energy. However, once human activity is detected, such as at 14:30, it immediately operates at maximum power for cooling, causing the indoor temperature to slightly deviate from the comfort zone. In Fig. 7(f), electric vehicle charging is influenced by electricity prices and SoC levels, usually taking place during periods of lower electricity costs. Fig. 7(g) also shows that in context I, storage absorbs excess renewable energy and acts as backup for household loads, whereas in context II, storage responds to price signals for system dispatch. For example, from 00:00 to 6:00, storage actively absorbs excess energy from the grid, and from 12:00 to 14:00, it supplies energy to the grid. Fig. 7(h) demonstrates how all DERs in the smart home are dispatched based on electricity price signals. 6.1.5 Comparison In the comparative simulations, we compared the proposed HAR-based SAC algorithm with home energy management under different conditions: Baseline 1: In this scenario, there is no home energy management. The controllable loads follow the actual usage data from the dataset. For HVAC, cooling operates at maximum power when the indoor temperature exceeds the upper comfort limit, and heating operates at maximum power when the indoor temperature falls below the lower comfort limit. The electric vehicle charging process uses the user's charging records from the dataset. Baseline 2: In this scenario, there is no human activity recognition. The smart home always uses the home energy management strategy from context I to control controllable loads, HVAC, and the electric vehicle. Distributed energy resources on the user side do not participate in peak shaving and valley filling for the power grid. Through comparison, it can be found in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 that over a period of one month, the proposed method saved 23.9 % of energy consumption compared to Baseline 1 and increased the cumulative operational profit of the smart home from \u20ac25.54 to \u20ac53.8. It should be noted that in the proposed method, the smart home's profit is composed of revenue from selling energy to the grid and subsidies from participating in ancillary services. These two parts are influenced by factors such as the season, the subsidies provided by the electricity supplier, peak-valley price differences, and human activities in the home. Therefore, the energy management strategy executed in different environments may vary significantly. While the proposed method consumes considerable time during the training process, the trained agents can be used for real-time decision-making. 6.2 Performance in NIST engineering laboratory dataset The data used was provided by the Net-Zero energy residential test facility of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), simulating the daily lives of two children and two adults. The data spans from February 2015 to January 2016, with a resolution of one minute, dividing each day into 1440 steps based on sensor data from the environment. The smart home overview and model parameters are provided in Table 7 and Table 8 . The different baseline conditions we used are the same as those in 6.1.5. We conducted a comparative analysis of home energy management under different seasons. Fig. 10 shows the temperature distribution and the average temperature for four months belonging to different seasons, as well as the percentage of time human activity was detected within the home during each month, calculated using our proposed human activity recognition algorithm. It can be observed that there is a relationship between human activity and outdoor temperatures; residents tend to stay indoors more when the outdoor temperature is not suitable for outdoor activities. Fig. 11 and Fig. 12 demonstrate the household energy consumption and energy expenditure after implementing energy management strategies under different baselines. It can be seen that our proposed energy management strategy performs well in different seasons, reducing energy consumption by more than 10 % compared to not using an energy management strategy. Moreover, for months with higher average temperatures and less human activity time, the energy management strategy achieved even more significant results, reducing household energy consumption by approximately 25 %. The simulation results show that our proposed strategy can still improve operational economy even when smart homes are not equipped with distributed energy resources such as storage systems or electric vehicles and do not participate in grid dispatching. 7 Discussion and conclusion In this study, we propose a HAR-based SAC algorithm for home energy management. Considering that household energy consumption is closely related to human activities within the home, we use ILM and sensors to monitor loads in the house to identify typical human activities associated with energy usage. Then, we categorize the environment into context I and context II. Under the premise of satisfying constraints, in context I, we focus on user satisfaction, aiming to reduce users' energy expenditures by scheduling household loads through the agents' perception of environmental changes. In context II, we emphasize the economic efficiency of the system, aiming to reduce potential energy waste and leverage the potential of DERs in smart homes for more economical grid dispatching. Simulation results from two case studies indicate that this method can ensure user satisfaction while effectively reducing energy consumption in smart homes and improving operational economy. For future research, we will further investigate energy management issues in clusters of smart homes and communities, as well as incorporate predictive elements into energy management.

        "dc:description": "Smart home energy management systems (SHEMS) can help users save on energy costs by controlling various household loads in response to environmental changes. However, human activity is closely related to household energy consumption, which can lead to potential energy waste. Additionally, smart homes often feature multiple types of distributed energy resources (DER), and how to leverage their potential for participating in grid scheduling without significantly impacting users remains an unresolved issue. This paper proposes an intelligent home energy management method based on human activity recognition (HAR) and deep reinforcement learning. By using activity recognition results derived from intrusive load monitoring (ILM), we categorize contexts into two groups. The agent employs the soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm for real-time control. In the first context, the goal is to ensure user satisfaction while reducing energy costs. In the second context, the focus is on controlling DER to participate in grid ancillary services to generate revenue. The proposed agent is trained using a real dataset, and simulations validate the effectiveness of the algorithm in home energy management.",
