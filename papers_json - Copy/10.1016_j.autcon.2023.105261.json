Department of Global Smart City Sungkyunkwan University Suwon 16419 Republic of Korea The digital twin (DT) model is the key to enabling DT-enabled applications and services by mathematically expressing the physics, dynamics, and indoor environment of a target building. However, the DT model may provide substandard performance owing to various operational uncertainties; as such, in-situ calibration is essential in building operations. This study proposed a neural network-based nonintrusive calibration (NNNC) method for a DT prediction model. A field application study was conducted on a prediction model developed for a district heating substation serving real residential buildings in Korea. The case study demonstrated (1) the operational uncertainty of the prediction model and (2) the dependence of the calibration accuracies on different indirect calibration approaches. The NNNC method showed a better calibration accuracy for the target prediction model than existing Bayesian inference-based nonintrusive calibration. Specifically, NNNC, using a correction function with a multi-layer perceptron, reduced the prediction model errors by 38.6% and 34.7% for bias and random errors, respectively. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of NNNC in DT-enabled building operations. Therefore, the NNNC ensured the applicability and reliability of the prediction model.

Providing building energy efficiency and savings throughout the building lifecycle is crucial to ensuring a global carbon-neutral scenario [2]. The International Energy Agency has emphasized building digitalization as the technological means for building energy systems more efficiently [3]. Building digitalization may be realized with concepts such as building information modeling (BIM), cyber-physical systems, and digital twins (DTs) [4,5]. Building digitalization implements building-level monitoring, management, and automation by serving as a holistic, synthetic, and supervised controller for a real physical system [6]. Furthermore, these contribute to improving energy systems' performance and intelligence more proactively [7]. In these contexts, building digitalization is considered as a key to achieving building-sector carbon neutrality through its synergistic potential with building operations. The digital twin (DT) can be considered a concrete concept for building operations and digitalization [4]. According to the original DT concept [8], it is defined as \u201ca set of a set of virtual information constructs that fully describes a potential or actual physical manufactured product from the micro atomic level to the macro geometrical level.\u201d The DT consists of a physical entity, a virtual model, and their automated bidirectional flow of data and information. To achieve the full or holistic digital twin environment, a virtual model should be integrated with behavioral, physical, dynamic, functional, and mathematical models, as well as geometrical models, in digital twins [4,9,10]. Virtual models are defined mathematically or physically based on the mathematical relationships between the DT elements, including operational data, information, and mathematical models, throughout the physical system's lifecycle [10]. Comprehensive virtual models are key for DT-enabled applications [11] and services including observation [12,13], simulation [14], diagnosis [15], prediction [16], and optimization [17,18]. Virtual models can be classified into observed and unobserved models depending on whether the model outputs are observed by the sensors in operation or not [19]. A prediction model is an unobserved model that calculates a target unobserved variable by using observed variables. The prediction model observes physical variables [20] such as the indoor environmental quality [21], occupant behaviors [22], and energy consumption [23] in unobserved environments. It also expands the sensing range by fusing with other models [24]. The benchmark model is an observed model providing reference values for unobserved and observed variables. It improves the applicability and reliability of the target sensors and models for tasks such as sensor virtualization [24], fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) [25], and model calibration [26] based on residuals calculated in the observed environments. Based on these functions, the virtual models provide continuous observation, verification, extension, and calibration for the actual building operating environment to create a complete DT environment [27]. To do so, it is important to leverage sufficient sensors, datasets, and building domain knowledge to build a virtual model able to reflect the complete physics of real buildings. However, the building modeling environments for establishing DT models are inherently insufficient. Buildings typically are large, complex, and heterogeneous, and install low-cost sensors with low redundancy. As such, certain model input variables are not regularly measured owing to sensor absences or failures during building operations, which may make precise modeling impossible. Even if accurate models are built using sufficient sensors and datasets, the DT models may be limited only to certain building operating patterns and conditions as the physical building environment naturally changes and ages. In fact, the model outputs may differ significantly from the ground truths owing to system aging, gaps between the design and operation, and various operational uncertainties [13]. As such, it is more difficult to construct DT models in building operations than in the existing DT environments of laboratories and facilities in other industries (e.g., manufacturing). Therefore, in-situ digital twinning is essential in building operations for constructing full DT environments. In-situ digital twinning is a modeling process employed to continuously construct, expand, verify, and calibrate DT models through building operations in the field [10]. The ultimate goal is to provide comprehensive DT environments that accurately represent building operations. However, the accuracy of in-situ digital twinning may deteriorate in DT environments owing to the practical issues mentioned above. Accordingly, in-situ calibration is essential to continuously build a reliable DT model in the in-situ digital twinning context. Many previous in-situ calibration studies have been conducted on virtual calibration (VC) [28,29], sensor fault detection, diagnosis, and estimation (SFDD&E) [30\u201332], and virtual in-situ calibration (VIC) [24,33\u201336] for operational models, virtual sensors, and/or physical sensors in various operational building systems. These studies were intended to detect, diagnose, and estimate the faults of the various sensor or model errors, such as the random and systematic errors in building operating systems. In-situ calibration is generally categorized into two approaches depending on the benchmark observation ( Y ) environment of the target sensor and model: intrusive and nonintrusive calibration. \u2022 An intrusive calibration is an approach to directly calibrating a target using benchmarks obtained from additional intrusive measurements of the target sensor or model. \u2022 A nonintrusive calibration is an approach to indirectly calibrating a target by utilizing available variables related to the target variable without additional intrusive efforts regarding the unobserved target sensor or model. Intrusive calibration is generally more accurate but more expensive, whereas nonintrusive calibration is more cost-effective but may be less accurate. Nonintrusive calibration is usually performed to overcome physical restrictions to in-situ digital twinning. Thus, nonintrusive calibration shows considerable potential under practical limitations such as restricted operational datasets and information, aging equipment and systems, and absences of target outputs during the long-term building life cycle [24,37]. The VIC framework has recently been expanded to enhance nonintrusive calibration for higher performance in DT environments with operational uncertainties. For instance, Koo and Yoon [24] proposed a nonintrusive calibration method based on model fusion to correct a virtual heating return water temperature sensor without a direct benchmark. Choi and Yoon [37] proposed a nonintrusive calibration method for a virtual heating return water temperature sensor based on a physical relationship and valve-opening rates related to the target. In the VIC research directions for operational models and/or working sensors, a correction function was defined to predict model and/or sensor errors that change according to various factors, including the aging of equipment, energy-saving efforts, and demand changes in the operating environment. For example, Yu et al. [28] calibrated a supply air temperature sensor through a quadratic polynomial correction function with two variables in a rooftop air-conditioning unit (RTU). Yoon and Yu [34] used correction constants to calibrate systematic errors in several physical sensors in a building energy system. Koo and Yoon [36] calibrated a backup virtual sensor through a quadratic polynomial correction function with one variable in a mixed heating system. Table 1 summarizes a literature review of sensor calibration applications in building operation systems. These previous studies have made progress in correcting various errors, including constant, systematic, and random errors in target sensors and models. Nevertheless, the following challenges have been encountered in the correction function modeling for nonintrusive calibration. Impossible feature extraction: In previous sensor calibration processes, correction functions were defined using system variables and residual information related to the target residuals before calibration. The unobserved model calibration process cannot extract input features representing strong correlations. Thus, correction function modeling is required without extracting the input features of unobserved models in a nonintrusive calibration process. Limited correction formulation: The correction functions in previous studies were defined as a constant or polynomial types with correction parameters. These correction functions have limitations in predicting various sensor and model errors robustly and accurately, including random, offset, and drift errors. A novel correction formulation is needed to continuously represent the various errors and improve the calibration performance and applicability of the unobserved models. A previous study [42] mentioned the necessity for an advanced correction formulation to extend the mathematical representation. Therefore, this study aims to propose a neural network-based nonintrusive calibration (named NNNC) method to overcome the aforementioned challenges in nonintrusive in-situ modeling for unobserved models in building operations. The NNNC can provide a high-performance prediction model based on the mathematical characteristics of neural network structures. This method allows for a broader, more diverse, and accurate representation of target model errors. It offers a higher degree of freedom for selecting the input features of a correction function, compared to a traditional polynomial function. The NNNC-driven correction function for the prediction model improvement can be defined as a nonlinear structure with multiple available input variables, which is capable of identifying various errors through a neural network. A field application study showed how the calibration accuracy depends on the correction formulation of the neural network structure in building operations. This case study demonstrated the capabilities of NNNC. This is the first study on nonintrusive calibration based on using a neural network in building operating systems. The proposed method can contribute to providing reliable DT models, applications, and services in building operations. Therefore, it can be effectively utilized to provide continuously reliable virtual sensing environments in DT-enabled building operations. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the nonintrusive calibration and correction formulation for the DT model. Section 3 describes the application of the proposed method to operational district substation systems. Section 4 shows the DT model accuracy in building operations and NNNC capabilities of the prediction model in the operational system. Finally, the conclusion summarizes the research findings and presents future research directions. 2 Methods 2.1 Definition of nonintrusive calibration Nonintrusive indirect calibration is a method aimed at indirectly correcting an unobserved prediction model in the unobserved operational environment. This method is formulated based on a distance function proposed in the previous VIC studies [24,27]. The distance function is formulated based on a benchmark residual related to the target model, as shown in Eq. (1). To do so, the in-situ model coupling technique [19] is used to connect the target unobserved prediction model output to one of the inputs of the related benchmark model as observed by a reliable sensor, as shown in Fig. 1 . Specifically, the target model is constructed as shown in Eq. (2) based on white-box modeling approach with the available physics, design information, and equipment specifications, as the model output dataset is not available in the modeling process. Prebuilt data-driven models can also be considered in the proposed nonintrusive calibration if the counterpart sensor is not available at all owing to sensor faults in operations. The benchmark model is constructed as shown in Eq. (3) based on a data-driven modeling approach using the related system variables and target model output, even though the prediction model has uncertainties before the calibration in this step. The hypothesis for the in-situ model coupling approach is that the indirect benchmark residual is minimized when the target model output is close to the true value. Thus, a correction function (g) is defined as shown in Eq. (4) by the correction parameters ( x c ) and input features (X); under the hypothesis, it must be added into the target model output, as shown in Eq. (4). (1) D x c = Y m , c B − Y o B 2 (2) Y m , c P = f P X + C , ∄ Y o P (3) Y m , c B = f B X Y m , c P , ∃ Y o B (4) C = g X x c where, D x c is the distance function, Y m , c B is the corrected benchmark model value, Y o B is the observed benchmark model value, Y m , c P is the corrected prediction model value, f P is the mathematical function for the prediction model, X is input of function, C is the correction variable, Y o P is the observed benchmark model value, f B is the mathematical function for the benchmark model, g is the correction function, and x c is the correction parameter. 2.2 Neural network-based machine learning algorithm for nonintrusive calibration 2.2.1 Concept and framework In this study, a neural network is used for the correction function to conduct the nonintrusive calibration for the prediction model. The NNNC is defined as follows: \u2022 The NNNC refers to a nonintrusive calibration approach that uses neural networks to provide a more extensive, diverse, and accurate representation of errors in the target model compared to conventional polynomial representations. A neural network is a mathematical model consisting of several simple neurons and is used to imitate the human brain. The neural network comprises node layers including an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each node is connected to another node and has associated weights and biases. The neural network uses learning algorithms to derive the optimal weights and biases to minimize a loss function. Fig. 2 shows the integration of the NNNC and the digital twin model. In this integrated system, physical sensor data collected from target buildings are employed to construct in-situ virtual models (benchmark and prediction models). These virtual models provide the NNNC with distance function models for nonintrusive calibration. Subsequently, the NNNC generates correction models to enhance the accuracy of unobserved prediction models within the virtual models. This improved prediction model environment, facilitated by the NNNC, can expand the limited coverage of the virtual model, which is initially constructed using benchmark models only, towards a more comprehensive digital twin environment. The extended virtual model, which includes benchmark and prediction models with the NNNC, can offer various applications and services (e.g., in situ virtual sensors in digital twins [43]) in real building operations. Fig. 3 shows the structure for estimating the correction parameters in the proposed NNNC. In the structure of the NNNC, the benchmark model is developed by using relational variables and the target prediction model as the input variables. Next, a correction variable is defined for the prediction model using the neural network. The input layers of the neural network should be defined as system variables or residual information related to the target residuals. The neural network-based correction function is defined as a nonlinear correction function with weights and biases through an activation function, as shown in Eq. (5). Based on this neural network structure with multiple available inputs variables, the correction function in the NNNC can be defined as a mathematical expression able to effectively identify varying and hidden model errors by adjusting the weights and biases between nodes, eliminating the need for an additional feature extraction process required in conventional polynomial correction functions. In situations where numerous input variables are present, it can be advantageous to prioritize input variables by identifying those with a strong correlation to the outputs of the uncorrected prediction model before the NNNC process.

Accordingly, the loss function defines the benchmark model residuals based on an in-situ model coupling technique, as shown in Fig. 3(B). Then, the weights and biases are derived through learning algorithms, including forward propagation and backpropagation that indirectly minimize the formulated loss function. At this time, the weights and biases in the benchmark model are fixed. Finally, the prediction model is corrected based on the correction variable calculated by the neural network. Table 2 shows the pseudocode for the proposed NNNC method. 3 Field application 3.1 Target district heating substation system A target system is a district heating substation system serving the upper heating zones of high-rise residential buildings in Korea (Fig. 4 ). The target district heating substation system transferred the supplied district heating heat source to the residential unit through a heat exchanger. The target system was divided into a primary-side that receives district heating heat sources and a secondary-side that supplied the heat sources to the residential unit, centered on the heat exchanger. The target system was supplied with a temperature of 115 to 100 ° C from a cogeneration plant. The secondary-side supply water temperature was controlled through an outdoor reset control method. The primary-side mass flow rate was controlled by a temperature control valve (TCV). The secondary mass flow rate was adjusted according to the interactions of the supply and return pressure sensors, differential pressure valve (DPV), and two parallel pumps. The two pumps were controlled using a variable frequency drive (VFD) method. A digital twin environment for the target system was established using the building automation system (BAS) implemented for the real building operations, as shown in Fig. 4. The RS485 interface was employed for the construction of the DT system, which includes wireless communications and sensor networks. It operates in real-time, allowing for the continuous monitoring of physical sensor measurements, virtual model calculations, and control of the district heating substation. The heating energy and operational datasets, which include sensor measurements and control signals for the target system, were collected at 1-minute intervals over 110winter days using the DT environment in operation for real buildings. Table 3 provides information on the equipment and sensor design of the target system. The proposed nonintrusive calibration method was applied to the prediction model for the secondary-side return water temperature, while a benchmark model was constructed for the secondary-side supply water temperature. It is important to note that sensor measurements for the secondary-side return water temperature were not utilized in prediction modeling and the NNNC calibration but were solely used for demonstration purposes after the implementation of the NNNC. 3.2 Prediction and benchmark model development The prediction model considered the secondary-side return water temperature in the target system. This model was formulated using system- and equipment-level functions, as shown in Eq. (6). The system-level function was established according to a governing equation representing the mathematical/physical relationship between the system-level variable ( X ) and target value ( Y ) in the operating system. The equipment-level function was established to overcome the difficulties in calculating the system-level function in the operating system owing to the limited sensing environment. The system-level function was formulated based on an energy balance equation, as shown in Eq. (7). It was assumed that the secondary-side energy and residential-side energy were the same by ignoring the heat loss through the pipeline. Accordingly, the residential-side energy was used in the system-level function and the unmeasured secondary-side mass flow in the building sensor network was calculated using the equipment-level function, as shown in Eq. (8). The equipment-level function was formulated using a pump curve ( h pump ) and system curve ( h sys ). The two curves were defined based on the pump specifications, heat exchanger test performance, and pipe structure information. The secondary-side mass flow rate was calculated from the operating point of the pump, that is, the intersection of the two curves. The specific modeling processes for the prediction model can be found in a previous study [13].

In this study, the secondary-side supply water temperature was adjusted according to the control feedback variables observed as the true values. Thus, the benchmark model was developed based on a data-driven approach by using a multi-layer neural network for the secondary-side supply water temperature. The benchmark model was trained using multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with the operational datasets measured during the 40 days. The benchmark model was structured with three hidden layers, each consisting of 32\u201316\u20138 neurons. The activation functions were defined by a ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) function, while the last hidden layer used a linear activation function. To prevent overfitting, random shuffle for training datasets and early stopping rules were employed. The operational dataset was normalized using min-max normalization in the model training [44]. The input variables of the benchmark model were defined according to the relative operating system variables available in the BAS (building automation systems) and outputs of the prediction model. The settings for MLP hyperparameters were defined, as presented in Table 4 , to ensure that the benchmark model have good performance. The developed benchmark model was operated for the remaining 70 days in winter. The real application scenarios and their periods for modeling, calibration, and operations were presented in Table 5 . 3.3 Nonintrusive calibration cases according to calibration approaches Cases were constructed to demonstrate the NNNC effectiveness by comparing previous widely used Bayesian inference (BI)-based nonintrusive calibration models [34,36,45]. Furthermore, to discuss the NNNC strategies, four cases were defined according to the correction function types and structures (Table 6 ). In this study, Cases 1 and 2 conducted the BI-based nonintrusive calibration and Cases 3 and 4 used the NNNC to estimate the correction parameters. The input features of the correction function were defined based on the system operating variables and residuals related to the prediction model. Case 1 defined a correction function as a quadratic equation with one input variable and three correction parameters. Case 2 defined a correction function using a polynomial with four input variables and ten correction parameters. Case 3 defined a correction function with two input nodes and one hidden layer. Case 4 defined a correction function with four input nodes and three hidden layers. To prevent overfitting, the neural networks for the correction function were designed with relatively simple architectures and appropriate hyperparameters in this case study. The calibration was conducted over a span of 11 days, encompassing various operational patterns and error conditions. The distance function in all cases was formulated as a residual of the benchmark model and physical counterpart for the secondary-side supply water temperature over 11 days (January 21 to 31, 2020). The correction parameters estimated during the calibration period were applied for the remaining 60 days in winter (February 1, 2020 to March 31, 2020). The BI was calculated as the posterior distribution of correction parameters that minimized the distance function using the prior distribution and likelihood function [46], as shown in Eqs. (9\u201311). In the BI-based nonintrusive calibration, the priors were defined as a Gaussian distribution with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 0.5, because the residual information for the prediction model was unknown before calibration [24,36]. The likelihood function was defined as a conditional probability distribution using a Gaussian distribution with a zero mean. The BI-based nonintrusive calibration cases were solved using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, which is difficult to overcome the issue calculation of the normalization constant ( P Y ). Bayesian MCMC sampling was conducted using the widely used Metropolis-Hastings algorithm [47,48]. In the NNNC, the loss function was defined as the mean squared error (MSE). The initial learning rate was set to 0.01 and the batch size was 32. The neural network was trained using the adaptive Gradient optimizer. Table 7 summarizes the hyperparameters used in the training to conduct NNNC. The problem-solving for all cases defined in this study was implemented using Python 3.9.

(6\u20138). The prediction model accuracy was evaluated using the root mean square error (RMSE) calculated from measurements of the outputs of the prediction model and ground truths, as shown in Eq. (12). The ground truths were measured and used only for the evaluation and validation of the target model accuracy. The white-box prediction model shows a significantly large RMSE of 0.806 ° C during the entire building operation period. In particular, the prediction model intermittently shows a daily RMSE higher than 1.0 ° C during certain periods (Fig. 5(c)). This is owing to the uncertainty in the physical formulation while ignoring the heat loss through the pipeline and the difference between the building design information and actual building operation. This result indicates the need for calibration of the prediction models in building operating systems. (12) RMSE = ∑ t = 1 T Y m , t − Y o , t 2 T Fig. 6 shows the accuracy of the benchmark model development based on the data-driven approach. The benchmark model shows an RMSE of 0.436 ° C during the development period and 0.520 ° C during the operation period. The benchmark model uses an uncertain prediction model output as one of the inputs, but has a rather small RMSE. This indicates that the benchmark model can be built considerably well even though the white-box model ( T 2 , ret P ) is not calibrated. 4.2 Nonintrusive calibration results according to different calibration approaches Table 8 shows the given prior distribution and estimated posterior distribution from using the Bayesian MCMC approach for two cases (Cases 1\u20132). The correction parameter is defined based on the mean value of the posterior distribution. Fig. 7 shows the curve distribution based on the loss values calculated during the neural network learning process. The loss values gradually decrease with the training stage, indicating that the neural network is not overfitted. In particular, Case 4 with a multi-layer neural network structure converges to a lower loss value than Case 3 with a single-layer neural network structure. During and after the NNNC method, the benchmark model in Case 4 exhibited an RMSE of 0.291 ° C and 0.351 ° C , respectively, because the prediction model outputs were improved. Fig. 8 shows the RMSE and standard deviation (SD) of the errors for the prediction model before and after nonintrusive calibration during the building operation period. The SD represents the bias and random error size of the prediction model. For the case before calibration and Cases 1\u20134, the prediction model shows RMSE values of 0.851 ° C , 0.746 ° C , 0.695 ° C , 0.581 ° C , and 0.484 ° C and SDs of 0.513 ° C , 0.467 ° C , 0.429 ° C , 0.352 ° C , and 0.297 ° C , respectively (Fig. 8(A)). In the two cases using the Bayesian MCMC approach, Case 2 shows a better calibration performance than Case 1. Considering the difference in the correction functions, the polynomial correction functions with multiple input features provide the potential to correct the different model errors. However, BI-based indirect calibration does not provide an RMSE lower than 0.60 ° C for the prediction model. This is because the polynomial correction function is insufficient to compensate for the prediction model uncertainty without the dataset of model observations ( Y ). In this situation, the two cases using the NNNC show better calibration performances than the BI-based indirect calibration. Case 4 improves the accuracies of the prediction model by 30.4% and 30.8%, respectively, compared to those of Case 2. The correction function with the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) structure provides excellent calibration accuracy, with an RMSE under 0.50 ° C for the prediction model. In addition, the residual distribution for the prediction model approaches zero in contrast to the case before calibration (Fig. 8(A)(b)). For the validation period, the prediction model shows RMSEs of 0.775 ° C , 0.652 ° C , 0.587 ° C , 0.559 ° C , and 0.476 ° C and SD values of 0.432 ° C , 0.399 ° C , 0.354 ° C , 0.327 ° C , and 0.282 ° C , respectively (Fig. 8(B)). The prediction model improves the accuracy after calibration in all cases. The NNNC provides better performance than BI-based indirect calibration, similar to the case with the calibration period. In particular, Case 4 reduces the prediction model errors in terms of the bias and random error by 38.6% and 34.7%, respectively. The validation improvements were slightly lower than the calibration improvements (43.2% and 42.2%) during the calibration period. This case study demonstrates the effectiveness of using nonintrusive calibration to improve a prediction model in an unobserved environment using in-situ model coupling techniques. It also shows the advancement of NNNC for the prediction model. 4.3 Discussions regarding the NNNC approach Fig. 9 shows the calibration results of the prediction model during the whole validation period for all cases. From comparing the overall calibration accuracy for the NNNC approaches, Case 4 shows a relatively lower daily RMSE distribution than that of Case 3 (Fig. 9(A)). This improvement indicates that the correction function with the MLP structure provides a better calibration performance than a correction function with a single-layer perceptron (SLP) structure. In the two neural network-based correction formulations, the correction function with the MLP structure is defined with a greater number of weights and biases than the SLP structure. Accordingly, the correction function with the MLP structure can identify various error characteristics in the prediction model. Using this correction formulation, Case 4 can successfully calibrate the various errors (including the offset, drift, and random errors) of the prediction model. Therefore, the correction function should use the MLP structure to provide a good calibration performance for the prediction model in the NNNC. However, in Case 4, the prediction model shows an accuracy lower than 0.48 ° C for 12 days in March (March 20 to March 31) (Fig. 9(A)(b)). Furthermore, after March 20, the NNNC shows a lower calibration accuracy than that of the BI-based nonintrusive calibration (Fig. 9(B)(b)). This is because correction parameters estimated based on previous calibration datasets may not be able to respond to extensive errors. Therefore, the NNNC strategies are needed to successfully compensate for the changing model errors owing to the different energy demands, system aging, and occupant behaviors during long-term building operations. Future studies should aim to continuously conduct the NNNC by updating the correction function during long-term building operations. 5 Conclusion This study proposed an NNNC method for a prediction model in a DT-enabled building operation. The nonintrusive calibration is an essential process for improving the accuracy of the prediction model without physical counterparts in the DT-enabled building operation. The neural network was used to determine unknown correction parameters using learning algorithms. In the NNNC, the correction function was defined as a nonlinear representation able to identify various model errors through a neural network structure. Case studies conducted on the actual district heating substation demonstrated the capabilities of the proposed NNNC method. In addition, we provided insights on neural network-based correction formulations to provide better calibration accuracy for the prediction model. A digital twin environment for the target system was established by utilizing a building automation system equipped with wireless communication and sensor networks, employing the RS485 interface for real-time building operations. The operational data measured by sensors were delivered to the NNNC-assisted virtual model, and the virtual model provided the accurate physical behavior of a secondary return temperature that was not observed by a sensor through the NNNC method. The virtual model could offer operational information regarding the temperature differences between supply and return paths, heating demand levels, partial loads, and system aging and faults for real system operations within the digital twin environment and graphical user interface. However, this study has limitations in demonstrating (1) diverse applications for various building systems, (2) strategies for optimizing the calibration performance of the NNNC, and (3) long-term cases involving continuous calibration. Future works will discuss providing a better NNNC performance with appropriate input variables and hyperparameters tuned through a commissioning process. A continuous and autonomous nonintrusive calibration of the NNNC is also planned, so as to provide a reliable DT sensing environment during long-term building operations.

        "dc:description": "The digital twin (DT) model is the key to enabling DT-enabled applications and services by mathematically expressing the physics, dynamics, and indoor environment of a target building. However, the DT model may provide substandard performance owing to various operational uncertainties; as such, in-situ calibration is essential in building operations. This study proposed a neural network-based nonintrusive calibration (NNNC) method for a DT prediction model. A field application study was conducted on a prediction model developed for a district heating substation serving real residential buildings in Korea. The case study demonstrated (1) the operational uncertainty of the prediction model and (2) the dependence of the calibration accuracies on different indirect calibration approaches. The NNNC method showed a better calibration accuracy for the target prediction model than existing Bayesian inference-based nonintrusive calibration. Specifically, NNNC, using a correction function with a multi-layer perceptron, reduced the prediction model errors by 38.6% and 34.7% for bias and random errors, respectively. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of NNNC in DT-enabled building operations. Therefore, the NNNC ensured the applicability and reliability of the prediction model.",
