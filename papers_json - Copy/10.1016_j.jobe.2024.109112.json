During the design phase, the annual energy consumption of heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems is frequently simplified or fixed under certain assumptions due to uncertain parameters within the control sequence, resulting in a performance gap between the intended and actual performances. This study assessed the impact of six uncertain parameters on system energy consumption and indoor temperature control under various updating scenarios. First, sensitivity analysis was conducted using the one-at-a-time method to identify the influential impact of the single uncertain parameter. Then, mutual impact analysis was conducted to showcase how different parameters affect each other, and mixed impact analysis was applied to evaluate how intended design performance converges to actual operating outcomes. A detailed physical model of a single-zone variable air volume system was developed to enable a comprehensive evaluation across different operational conditions. The results indicate that a 10% change in some parameters can lead to a 20 ∼ 30% increase in energy consumption, especially during low-load winter months. Properly evaluating the influence of one parameter is difficult without taking the effects of additional parameters into account, and some combinations of parameters can significantly decrease the system performance. These results underscore the necessity of considering the updating and combination scenarios of different parameters within the control sequences during the design phase.

Within the building sector, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems stand out as the primary contributors to energy consumption and carbon emissions [2,3]. Thus, improving the efficiency of HVAC systems is crucial to achieving energy savings and reducing the carbon footprint of the building sector [4,5]. The effective operation and control of HVAC systems play a crucial role in optimizing their performance. Dynamic factors like ambient temperature, solar heat gain, and occupancy levels continually influence the system\u2019s operational conditions. Inadequate control strategies can cause deviations from the intended design performance, potentially leading to system instability and excessive energy consumption [6]. Therefore, implementing a robust system control strategy is paramount. Modifying control sequences, for instance, can result in annual site energy savings of up to 30%, prompting a critical inquiry into the optimality of commonly practiced control sequences [7]. A primary reason for suboptimal performance lies in the conventional control design process, where mechanical designers typically specify building control sequences using a specific language. These sequences are then often implemented by control contractors, who might adapt control strategies from similar projects with presumed equivalent control objectives [8]. A comparable scenario exists in Japan, where instrumentation contractors largely dictate the work from design to construction phases, often with limited involvement from the original designer (see Fig. 1). This approach can lead to ambiguous control specifications and significant uncertainties, resulting in divergent implementation and creating a performance gap between the intended design and actual operation. To address this performance gap, it is crucial to identify and quantitatively assess the impact of control sequence uncertainties on both energy consumption and indoor air temperature controllability. 1.2 Uncertainty analysis on HVAC systems Uncertainty analysis (UA) focuses on quantifying the uncertainty in the output of a simulation model due to variations in input factors [9]. UA has gained considerable importance in evaluating building energy performance as it provides an important framework to address and integrate the inherent uncertainties related to various factors such as occupant behavior, building thermal properties, weather conditions, and HVAC systems [10]. These uncertainty parameters typically fall into three categories: physical, design, and scenario [11]. Physical uncertainty parameters involve intrinsic properties of building materials, including attributes such as thickness, density, and thermal conductivity of walls, roofs, and floor layers. Design parameters\u2019 uncertainties relate to variations arising during the planning phase, covering aspects such as building mass and orientation. In contrast, scenario uncertainty parameters are dynamic and may evolve during a building\u2019s lifespan. These uncertainties are influenced by factors such as fluctuations in weather data, climate change, occupant behavior, and HVAC systems. Accounting for scenario uncertainties becomes crucial when assessing the design robustness and adaptability of buildings under present and future conditions [11]. For example, Delgarm et al. [12] investigated the effects of design variables, such as building orientation and window size, on building energy demands using an EnergyPlus model. Belazi et al. [13] explored the influence of occupant behavior and building envelope materials on energy performance across diverse weather conditions. Examining uncertainty in cooling and heating loads, Zhu et al. [14] investigated the quantification of uncertainty, considering eleven architectural parameters, including building aspect ratio, window-to-wall ratio, the u-value of the envelope, and solar heat gain coefficient. While HVAC systems significantly impact overall building energy performance, research efforts addressing uncertainties in this domain have been relatively limited compared to other uncertainties within the building sector [10]. To overcome traditional limitations in HVAC system design, certain studies have explored the impact of uncertainty on their component configurations [15]. For instance, Huang et al. [16] introduced a prototype for HVAC system design aimed at mitigating reliance on conventional \u201crules of thumb\u201d. Wang et al. [17] conducted optimization of air-side system sizing using the UA approach. In the waterside HVAC systems domain, several studies have pioneered novel techniques to address uncertainties in system design. Cheng et al. [18] introduced a robust design method based on sequential Monte Carlo simulations, transcending traditional component-focused methods. Similarly, Li and Wang [19] proposed a probabilistic method for sizing air-conditioning water pump systems. UA has proven effective in optimizing the configuration of multiple-chiller systems as well [20,21]. These approaches collectively advance HVAC system design, aligning it more closely with actual operating conditions and energy-saving objectives. Additionally, several studies have analyzed the influence of uncertainty in annual hourly load profiles on system energy efficiency. Huang et al. [22] assessed the uncertainty associated with annual hourly load profiles for various commercial buildings, focusing on the relationship between load profile variability and energy efficiency. Ding et al. [23] investigated the effects of load uncertainty on the annual energy efficiency of office buildings. Recently, UA of HVAC systems has found diverse applications, demonstrating its versatility and importance. It has been utilized to assess the impact of model parameter uncertainty on HVAC system evaluations, especially concerning indoor virus mitigation [24,25]. Furthermore, uncertainty quantification techniques have been applied to estimate the impact of model accuracy on the model-based optimal control [26] and refine flow measurements for chiller systems [27,28]. These applications highlight the broad significance of UA in the HVAC systems field, contributing to enhanced system performance, safety, and energy efficiency across various domains. Although UA has been widely applied to evaluate building energy performance, much of the study in this area has been on quantifying variations in diverse distributions for decision-making and system design. Detailed control sequences have often been simplified due to the computational intensity linked to high-fidelity building models and detailed control models [29]. Some studies, however, have specifically investigated UA related to HVAC system control strategies. Wang et al. [30] investigated uncertainties in building energy consumption arising from HVAC operation schedules and actual weather data. Their findings highlighted that uncertainties in HVAC operation significantly influenced annual energy consumption, ranging from −15.3 to 70.3%. Yan et al. [31] conducted research focusing on quantifying the uncertainty associated with the actual operation of a system, particularly emphasizing outdoor airflow control parameters in an air handling unit (AHU) system. Liao et al. [32] utilized UA to analyze the impact of uncertainty in four different chiller staging sequences based on a building cooling load indicator. This analysis extended to evaluating the selection and robustness of the control strategy [33]. Shan et al. [34] incorporated measurement errors linked to HVAC sensors into near-optimal and optimal control strategies, quantifying the dispersion of plant power and annual energy consumption. They applied Monte Carlo sensitivity and uncertainty analyses to assess the impact of CO 2 and airflow measurement errors on outdoor airflow setpoints and return air CO 2 concentrations for demand-controlled ventilation strategies [35]. Additionally, Wang et al. [36] assessed the impact of uncertainty in sensors and actuators on energy consumption in a cooling plant integrated with lake water, particularly in the context of a data center. Abdel Haleem et al. [29,37] investigated and quantified performance in terms of energy consumption and indoor environmental quality, managing uncertainty arising from sensors and actuators. Their research underscored the significant impact of temperature sensors on system performance within a specific control sequence. Table 1 presents a succinct summary of recent studies examining uncertainties related to HVAC control. These studies collectively illustrate that by systematically analyzing and quantifying uncertainties\u2019 influence on system control, informed decisions can be made to enhance the overall performance and efficiency of HVAC systems. As automation systems integrate progressively sophisticated control strategies [38], further research is essential to deepen our comprehension of this intricate domain and explore additional opportunities for enhancement. 1.3 Objective of this study Following a thorough review and discussion, two main limitations of the existing studies related to UA in HVAC system control were identified. \u2022 In HVAC systems, variable air volume (VAV) systems maintain consistent indoor temperatures by adjusting supply air in response to varying heat loads. They are widely adopted for their potential to improve energy efficiency and indoor environments [39]. However, there has been limited attention given to investigating the impact of uncertainties in control sequences for these systems. To the best of the authors\u2019 knowledge, there is a scarcity of studies analyzing uncertainty in both the air and water sides of VAV systems. While a few studies have concentrated on the control of the air side of VAV systems, it is essential to recognize that both air and water side controls can significantly influence system performance. Therefore, a holistic approach that encompasses both aspects is crucial for obtaining a comprehensive understanding of VAV system performance. \u2022 Most current studies exclusively consider HVAC control-related uncertainties within the operational phase of HVAC systems. This focus restricts their applicability to the design phase of HVAC systems. Different uncertainties might appear in different phases of HVAC systems, and they may change over time, in a manner similar to how uncertainties introduced throughout the life cycle of buildings can generate deviations in the building energy performance [40,41]. For instance, certain unknown parameters from the design phase may become known during the construction phase. Studying how uncertain parameters vary across different phases ensures a more comprehensive and robust approach for HVAC system design. In light of these limitations, this study focuses on exploring the impact of uncertain parameters within the control sequence of VAV systems, encompassing the design, construction, installation, and operation phases. The study identifies parameters prone to post-design revisions or frequently overlooked during the design process. Analyzing the variability of these parameters within the VAV system\u2019s control sequence enables a comprehensive assessment of performance deviations. Moreover, this research elucidates the convergence of system performance as uncertain parameters are updated from the design to operation phases. The presented work involves the development of a detailed physics model for the entire VAV system, capable of simulating how indoor air temperature and energy consumption respond to variations in control parameters. Through the identification of specific uncertain parameters or combinations significantly impacting system performance adversely, this study facilitates proactive measures during the design phase to mitigate potential issues and enhance overall system efficiency. By addressing the uncertainties in HVAC systems from design to operation, this study provides an evaluation framework for developing HVAC system control strategies under various operational conditions and scenarios. 2 Model development of VAV system To evaluate the impact of uncertainty control parameters on system performance, it is imperative to develop a comprehensive physical model of the entire VAV system. This model should simulate how indoor air temperature and energy consumption respond to variations in the control parameters. This section outlines the development of the system model. 2.1 Target system Fig. 2 illustrates a representation of the hypothetical target system under examination, formulated based on Case AE200, as outlined in the ASHRAE Standard [42]. This system comprises an AHU with a supply air (SA) fan and coil, return air (RA) fan, exhaust air (EA) fan, air source heat pump (ASHP), water pump, recirculated air damper, and bypass valve (BV). Heat load calculation and component sizing adhere to the Building Equipment Design Standards [43], a widely used framework for designing HVAC systems in Japan. The virtual single-zone VAV system has a zone area of 217.8 m 2 and height of 2.6 m , and the roof and floor are assumed to be adiabatic. 2.2 Overview of the simulation program To assess the impact of uncertain operating parameters on overall VAV system performance and underscore the importance of comprehensive studies during the design phase, the simulation program needs to possess four key functionalities: (1) The program should theoretically calculate the power requirements of pumps and fans, considering the pressure distribution within the system. (2) Equipment\u2019s physical state should correspond accurately to the control state to simulate operational behavior and feedback control, such as proportional\u2013integral (PI) control. (3) It should facilitate easy adjustment of different control variables within the control sequence. (4) The program should replicate the impacts of uncertainty parameters across the entire VAV system. Therefore, we developed a simulation program leveraging the object-oriented features of Python. The simulation process is depicted in Fig. 3. This program computes control setpoints, flow rates, pressures, temperatures, and power consumption at discrete time intervals. The selected time step was adaptable; for this study, it was configured to five seconds to accurately capture transient system component states. The analyzed data were then presented as 1-minute average values derived from the 5-second results. 2.3 Equipment component models 2.3.1 ASHP The ASHP model employed in this study is based on the BEST program [44]. This model determines the operating coefficient of performance (COP) ratio r COP through Eq. (1): (1) r COP = f 1 ( r load , T o ) , where f 1 ( ⋅ ) represents the characteristic curves (Fig. 4) dependent on the load ratio r load , obtained from Eq. (2), and outdoor air temperature T o . (2) r load = L L rated Here, L denotes the processed heat load, calculated using Eq. (3) for cooling and Eq. (4) for heating. (3) L c = ( T w,in,c − T w,out,c,set ) ⋅ c w ⋅ ρ w ⋅ Q w,c (4) L h = ( T w,out,h,set − T w,in,h ) ⋅ c w ⋅ ρ w ⋅ Q w,h Here, T w,in,c and T w,in,h represent the inlet water temperature under cooling and heating modes, respectively. T w,out,c,set and T w,out,h,set represent the outlet water temperature under cooling (7 °C) and heating (45 °C) conditions. Q w,c and Q w,h denote the water flow rates for cooling and heating, respectively. In instances where the processed heat load is less than the maximum capacity, the outlet water temperature will coincide with the predetermined set point. Alternatively, when the processed heat load exceeds the maximum capacity, the outlet water temperature can be determined using the following equations: (5) T w,out,c = T w,in,c − L c,max c w ⋅ ρ w ⋅ Q w,c , (6) T w,out,h = T w,in,h + L h,max c w ⋅ ρ w ⋅ Q w,h , where L c,max and L h,max represent the maximum cooling and heating capacities of the ASHP, respectively. With the rated COP given, the energy consumption of the ASHP can be calculated using Eq. (7): (7) E ASHP = L COP ⋅ r COP 2.3.2 Pump and fan The pump and fan models compute pressure and power consumption based on the flow rate and frequency speed. This was achieved using flow\u2013pressure characteristic curves and flow\u2013efficiency curves, as shown in Fig. 5. Conversely, the flow rate could be estimated from the pressure. In the context of the flow\u2013pressure characteristic curve, the inverter frequency, ranging from 0 to 50 Hz, transformed into a normalized value between 0 and 1, denoted as i n v . The rated flow rate Q in m 3 / min and the rated total pressure P in kPa for pumps and Pa for fans were represented. The flow rate Q i n v and total pressure P i n v were calculated using Eqs. (8) and (9) as the i n v value changed. The relationship between the rated flow rate and total pressure, f 2 ( ⋅ ) , was obtained from an approximate equation derived from the characteristic curves, expressed in Eq. (10). This equation facilitated expressing the relationship between the flow rate Q i n v and pressure P i n v as the inverter frequency ( i n v ) changed, as shown in Eq. (11). The electrical power consumed was calculated using Eq. (12). (8) Q i n v = Q ⋅ i n v (9) P i n v = P ⋅ i n v 2 (10) P = f 2 ( Q ) (11) P i n v = f 2 ( Q i n v i n v ) ⋅ i n v 2 (12) E = g ρ Q i n v P i n v η 2.3.3 Valve and damper For both the valve and damper, the relationship between flow rate and pressure loss concerning the degree of opening was modeled. The degree of opening is represented as a percentage, with 0% indicating complete closure and 100% representing full openness. The valve model considers equal percentage characteristics. The inherent rangeability, denoted as R , defines the ratio between the minimum and maximum controllable flow rates while maintaining constant pressure losses before and after the valve. Additionally, the model incorporates flow coefficients, represented by C v and C v , max , indicating the flow coefficient when the valve is fully open. In the context of equal percentage characteristics, the flow coefficient C v for a given valve opening degree V is expressed in Eq. (13), where V max represents the largest degree of valve opening (equivalent to 100%). Rearranging the equation gives Eq. (14), describing the valve pressure loss ( Δ P v ). In this model, C v , max and R are set to 800 and 100, respectively. (13) C v = C v , max ⋅ R ( V V max − 1 ) (14) Δ P v = 1743 ρ w ρ Q 2 C v 2 The characteristic curves, as shown in Fig. 6, are used to calculate the pressure drops across the damper. Denoting the pressure loss coefficient as K d , these curves were fitted to the quadratic equations (Eq. (15)). (15) Δ P d = K d ⋅ Q 2 2.3.4 Coil The coil within the VAV system operates as a water\u2013air heat exchanger. This coil model was developed based on [45]. Key parameters for the model, such as flow rate, airflow rate, and capacity at rating, were acquired from the design documentation. A hot-water coil model was utilized for heating, whereas the cold-water coil model was employed for air-cooling purposes. 2.4 Flow\u2013pressure balance model To calculate the flow rate and pressure distribution inside the duct and pipe network system, the simulation program utilizes a flow-pressure balance model. This model solves the relationship between adjacent nodes, where the nodes are the branching and merging points of a duct or pipe network system. The balance point is determined by equating the pressure losses attributed to the piping or ducting and equipment with the pressure boost provided by the pump or fan, assuming a steady state at each time step. This flow balance calculation is analogous to Kirchhoff\u2019s circuit laws in electrical circuits and follows two rules: \u2022 At any node within the system, the sum of inflow and outflow quantities should remain constant; \u2022 In any closed loop within the system, considering the pressure direction in one direction, the sum of those pressure values equals zero. The pressure loss, denoted as Δ P , within the duct and pipe network, was calculated using the Darcy\u2013Weisbach Equation as expressed in Eq. (16): (16) Δ P = λ l ρ v 2 2 d . Here, λ denotes the friction factor, l denotes the length of the pipe, d denotes the hydraulic diameter of the pipe, ρ denotes the fluid density, and v denotes the flow velocity. Eq. (16) can be rearranged to obtain Eq. (17), which describes the relation between the pressure loss ( Δ P ), the flow rate ( Q ), and the pressure loss coefficient ( K ): (17) Δ P = K ⋅ Q 2 . The pressure loss coefficients for each branch of the piping or duct network are adjusted according to the actual flow rate and the inverter frequency of the pump or fan. All flow rate balance calculations are resolved using the bisection method. 2.5 Room heat balance model A room heat balance model is utilized to compute the thermal equilibrium within the room, considering heat acquisition from diverse sources and heat removal by air conditioning. This model is represented by Eq. (18) [46]: (18) C room d T room d t = ∑ n = 1 N s A n α (c) , n T s , n − T room + c a Q inf T o − T room + H (c) − H ac , where T room denotes indoor air temperature, C room is the heat capacity of the room encompassing the indoor air and furniture. N s denotes the total number of surface areas within the room, including walls, windows, floors, and roofs. A n represents the area of the corresponding surface, α (c) , n denotes the convective heat transfer coefficient associated with that surface, and T s , n represents the temperature of the respective surface. The backward difference method is used to determine the heat transfer within the walls [47]. c a Q inf T o − T room accounts for the heat gain resulting from air infiltration, involving the infiltration rate, Q inf , air specific heat capacity, c a , and outdoor air temperature, T o . Finally, H (c) comprises the total convection components of heat generated by the human body, lighting, and equipment. At the same time, H ac represents the heat removed from the room by the air conditioning, with heating considered as a negative value. To validate the thermal calculations and the reliability of the room temperature simulation, an evaluation test was conducted following ANSI/ASHRAE [42] and SHASE [48] guidelines. The free-float test case 600FF, designed for simulating natural room temperature calculations in a room with a small heat capacity, was adopted. The input values and parameters were set according to the specified conditions. The results, displayed in Fig. 7, demonstrate that the natural room temperature calculated in our simulation program closely aligns with the results from several other simulation programs, confirming the accuracy and reliability of our simulation program. 2.6 Control strategies The VAV system implements specific control strategies on both the air and water sides, which are based on a real experimental building [49]. 2.6.1 Water side control strategy The water side of the VAV system was set up as a two-pipe system with manual switching between cooling and heating operations. Fig. 8 depicts the variable water volume control of the water side, accomplished through the regulation of pump speed and BV opening. To prevent an excessive flow of cold or hot water into the AHU at the beginning of daily air-conditioning operations, the inverter frequency of the cold- and hot-water pumps was fixed at 10 Hz, the lower limit, and the BV was initially fully closed. The control sequence comprised the following steps: 1. With the BV opening set, the pump\u2019s inverter frequency is regulated by a PI controller to approach the predetermined supply water temperature. 2. If the pump\u2019s inverter frequency remains at the lower limit of 10 Hz for more than 15 min, it stays fixed at the lower limit, and the BV opening shifts to PI control. 3. If the BV opening degree stays at 25%, the lower limit opening, for 20 min or more, the BV opening degree remains at the lower limit, and control reverts to the pump\u2019s inverter frequency control. 4. When the BV stays fully open for 30 min, the ASHP is stopped, and the water temperature is controlled by default. 5. The ASHP restarts when the room temperature rises 1 °C higher than the set room temperature during cooling or falls 1 °C lower during heating. 2.6.2 Air side control strategy The flowchart of the supply air temperature control implemented on the air side is shown in Fig. 9. This strategy depends on acquiring the room temperature and setpoint to compute the demand airflow rate. The demand airflow rate is calculated at one-minute intervals, adhering to the concept of PI control. Adjustments to the damper opening and air supply fan speed were made based on the air demand and the supplied air volume in the room. The required airflow rate Q req was determined using Eq. (19) for cooling and Eq. (20) for heating. (19) Q req = K P T room − T set + ∫ K I T room − T set d t + Q min (20) Q req = K P T set − T room + ∫ K I T set − T room d t + Q min Here, T set denotes the set point of the room temperature (fixed at 26 °C for cooling and 22 °C for heating), whereas T room denotes the calculated room temperature. The proportional gain K P was calculated using Eq. (21), and the integral gain K I was determined using Eq. (22). Q min denotes the minimum supply airflow rate, which is set to 14 m 3 / min . (21) K P = Q max − Q min Δ T P , (22) K I = 1 T I , where Q max denotes the maximum supply airflow rate set tp 80 m 3 / min , Δ T P denotes the temperature variation range, which is 3 °C, and T I is the integral time, which is set to 15 min. Moreover, the design considered 22 occupants with a ventilation rate of 30 m 3 / ( h ⋅ person ) , resulting in the introduction of outside air at 11 m 3 / min . During the cooling process, a \u201clow air volume setting\u201d was employed to decrease the supply air temperature, and reduce fan power consumption. Conversely, during heating, a \u201chigh air volume setting\u201d was implemented to increase the supply air volume and lower the supply air temperature, ensuring an even distribution of temperature within the room. The boundary airflow rate, approximately half of the maximum airflow rate, acts as the threshold to determine the lower limit for adjusting the set temperature of the supply air. The room temperature was predominantly controlled by regulating the circulation air damper opening and fan inverter frequency control. This control involved dividing the circulation air damper opening and fan inverter frequency control into 5-second intervals, conducting demand air volume calculations every 1 min, and adjusting the supply air temperature every 5 min. 3 Analysis of the impact of uncertainty on system performance 3.1 Uncertainty parameter selection As there are over 1000 parameters potentially subject to study in building energy simulations [50], we initially delimited the scope of uncertainty analysis in this study for feasibility. In this context, \u201cuncertainty parameters\u201d specifically denote parameters offering multiple value options not accounted for during the design phase or determined only after that phase. Such parameters contribute to a potential discrepancy between the actual system performance during operation and the anticipated system design performance. The selection of uncertainty parameters was based on three criteria. 1. Large impact on system performance: Within this context, system performance pertains to both the potential for energy savings and room temperature controllability. The extent of the impact is contingent upon the range of deviation from the initial design phase when these parameters undergo updates. For parameters with known reasonable settings based on actual conditions, those settings were replicated. In contrast, for parameters where actual conditions remained unknown, the effects were estimated by assuming a 5 ∼ 10% alteration in their values. 2. Likely to change or update after the design phase: Two main types of parameters fall into this category. The first type remains unknown because they are not measured post-design phase, such as airtightness class, thermal conductivity of concrete, and thermal capacity of furniture. The second type comprises parameters not determined during the design phase and considered in a simplified, fixed, or hypothetical manner, but can potentially be determined in later phases. Since the former cannot practically be determined or updated, our preference was to select parameters from the latter category. 3. High value for consideration with integrated HVAC and building simulation: The developed simulation program integrates physical models such as flow balance calculations, equipment models like pump performance curves, and control models including PI control. It replicates the effects at the whole building level, encompassing transient equipment and control conditions. Hence, we prioritized selecting parameters highly relevant to equipment load characteristics and control logic, which are challenging to account for in conventional simulations. These parameters also consider the influence of factors determined after the design phase and can impact both primary and secondary systems. According to the defined criteria, the following six parameters were selected for the uncertainty analysis: 1. Duct resistance coefficient: The data referenced during the design phase erred on the side of caution, leading to the assumption of a high-pressure drop coefficient for ducts. The precise pressure drop of ducts can be ascertained after the construction phase, and this parameter will be determined during that phase. 2. Minimum SA fan frequency: Despite its significance in low-load operations, this value often gets overlooked during the design phase. Frequently, the frequency is set between 20 ∼ 25 Hz, following suggestions in manufacturer\u2019s manuals. Determination of this parameter typically occurs in the installation phase. 3. Coefficients of load factor\u2013COP performance curves of ASHP: The characteristic curves will be adjusted using measured results obtained from an open-circuit test during the functional performance test after construction. These curves are contingent upon the water outlet temperature of the ASHP, a parameter to be determined in the installation phase. 4. Coil rated power: The rated power may be reconsidered due to inadequate capacity observed in an open-circuit test during the functional performance test or the value engineering process. This parameter will be determined in the construction phase. 5. ASHP outlet water temperature: Lowering the ASHP water outlet temperature during cooling reduces the required airflow rate, but it may negatively impact its COP. Conversely, in winter, increasing this temperature may be advantageous. This parameter will be determined in the operational phase. 6. Supply air outlet temperature range: This parameter can be readily adjusted based on environmental conditions and operational modes. Its determination will take place during the operational phase. The uncertainty parameters are examined for potential updates aiming to enhance the system\u2019s performance. The decision scenarios for these parameters and their respective variation ranges are detailed in Table 2. Notably, the \u201cs 1 \u201d and \u201cs 2 \u201d denote the designed values for duct resistance coefficient and COP performance curves of ASHP, respectively. In this study, we presumed that these parameters would undergo updates grounded on the outcomes of the base case, which emulated the design performance, striving toward an anticipated improvement in performance upon value updates. This simplification ensures consistent causal relationships within the analyses. Typically, uncertainty analysis involves utilizing statistical distributions of uncertain parameters as input [10]. However, in this study, spanning from design to operation stages, employing statistical distributions would result in a significantly heavy computational load. As an alternative, we chose to utilize the specific parameter update ranges for different stages rather than employing statistical distributions. 3.2 Identification of key uncertain parameters In this study, we utilize a sensitivity analysis [9] technique to discern the sources of uncertainty in the system\u2019s output linked to various uncertainties in its input factors. An method known as one-at-a-time (OAT) was used. This approach involves three primary steps: 1. Change only one input factor while keeping the others at their base values to calculate the output. 2. Return the changed input factor to its base value and repeat step 1 for each level and input factor. 3. Monitor changes in the output and plot them to visualize the sensitivity between each input factor and the output. By following these steps, we can achieve a direct and visual understanding of the system output\u2019s sensitivity to each input factor. This process assists in identifying the key parameters that exert the most significant impact on the system\u2019s performance. 3.3 Mutual and mixed impact analysis In addition to the sensitivity analysis, which focuses solely on the variation of individual parameters, a more comprehensive examination involves exploring the mutual effects of two parameters and the mixed impact of six parameters on system performance. The mutual impact analysis involves the random selection of two parameters, and their values are updated from the design to the operational phase. This approach makes it possible to investigate the interactions between these selected parameters in-depth and offers insights into how altering two parameters at once may impact system performance. In the mixed impact analysis, a total of 64 cases are considered, where each of the six specified parameters has two alternatives, both before and after the update. This extensive analysis allows for the assessment of the range and distribution of performance initially assumed during the design phase. Moreover, it provides insights into how these various scenarios converge to operational performance. By considering multiple parameters simultaneously, we aim to achieve a more holistic understanding of the system\u2019s behavior across different phases. 3.4 System performance evaluation To evaluate the impact on the system performance, the following four performance indices were used: \u2022 Total Energy Consumption of All Equipment: This metric is utilized to assess the overall energy efficiency of the entire VAV system by considering the total energy consumed by all equipment within it. \u2022 System Coefficient of Performance (SCOP): This metric is associated with energy efficiency and is computed by dividing the amount of heat processed by an air conditioner by the total electricity consumption of all equipment. A higher SCOP value signifies higher energy efficiency. \u2022 Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of Temperature: This metric offers a detailed assessment of temperature controllability. It measures the temperature error by determining the absolute difference between the room temperature at each time step and the target room temperature. The MAE is computed as follows: (23) M A E = 1 n ∑ i = 1 n | T room , i − T set | , where n is the number of operational time steps, T r o o m , i is the room temperature at time step i , and T s e t is the target room temperature. A smaller MAE value indicates better temperature control. \u2022 Control Rate of Target Temperature within ±1.0 °C: This metric offers a basic assessment of temperature controllability. It measures the proportion of time during which the room temperature remains within ±1.0 °C of the target room temperature, relative to the total operational time. The selection of ±1.0 °C as the threshold value aligns with the restart conditions following the shutdown of the ASHP. A higher control rate signifies greater temperature stability. 3.5 Case study setting To explore the impact of selected uncertain parameters on system performance, we conducted a comprehensive case study. Initially, design conditions for both indoor and outdoor environments were determined, as detailed in Tables 3 and 4. Based on these conditions, all equipment was selected, and its technical specifications are summarized in Table 5. Various scenarios involving updates to uncertain parameters were simulated over a week, spanning three distinct seasons: summer (August), intermediate (May), and winter (January). Weather data from Tokyo in the year 2000 [51] formed the basis for these simulations, and outdoor air temperature data are illustrated in Fig. 10. The calculation conditions for the base case were established in alignment with the design specifications outlined in Table 6. The results of these computations reflect the designed performance of the system. 4 Simulation results and discussion 4.1 Sensitivity analysis with one parameter To begin our analysis, we computed the system\u2019s design performance based on the settings detailed in Section 3.5, and the results are delineated in Table 7. Following this, we utilized the OAT approach, as described in Section 3.2, to conduct a sensitivity analysis. The results, depicted in Fig. 11, illustrate the x -axis labeled \u201cDesign\u201d, which signifies the outcomes for the base case where all six parameters are configured to their design values. The label \u201cOperation\u201d showcases the results when all six parameters are adjusted to their operational values. In cases ① to ⑥, only the parameter corresponding to the respective number is updated to its operational value, while the other parameters remain set at their design value. During the summer operation, the reduction of the ASHP outlet water temperature (parameter ⑤) yielded a 5.2% increase in system energy usage. Although this decrease in water temperature lowered the fan\u2019s power consumption by reducing the supply air volume, it concurrently raised the ASHP\u2019s energy consumption, ultimately outweighing the energy savings achieved by the fan. Conversely, elevating the coefficients of load factor\u2013COP performance curves of the ASHP (parameter ③) resulted in a 4.3% reduction in overall system energy consumption. This reduction was attributed to the heightened COP of the ASHP, a pivotal factor influencing the system\u2019s overall energy consumption. Regarding the MAE of temperature, diminishing the minimum SA fan frequency (parameter ②) led to a notable 14.0% reduction in MAE. This reduction was a consequence of the lower minimum SA fan frequency, which enhanced system controllability, particularly under low-load conditions. Conversely, reducing the minimum supply air temperature (parameter ⑥) increased the temperature offset by 9.5%. This increase was attributed to the broader supply air temperature range, resulting in a larger deviation between the setpoint and the calculated supply air temperature [49]. Consequently, the system took a longer time to reach the setpoint. Notably, changes in these parameters did not affect the ±1.0 °C control rate. When all parameters were modified during the operation phase, improvements in power consumption and COP characteristics were balanced by the enhancement in temperature controllability. During intermediate operation, similar to the trends observed in summer operation, augmenting the coefficients of load factor\u2013COP performance curves of the ASHP (parameter ③) resulted in a 3.5% reduction in system energy consumption. This reduction was attributed to the enhanced COP of the ASHP, contributing to a decrease in its electricity consumption. Similarly, elevating the ASHP outlet water temperature (parameter ⑤) also led to a decrease in system energy consumption. The reduction in the power consumption of the ASHP, owing to the higher water temperature, surpassed the increase in fan and pump conveying power, resulting in overall energy savings. This trend was consistently reflected in the SCOP. In terms of the MAE of temperature and ±1.0 °C control rate, both diminishing the minimum SA fan frequency (parameter ②) and increasing the ASHP outlet water temperature (parameter ⑤) had a positive impact. These adjustments facilitated improved temperature controllability by enabling faster and more effective adjustments, particularly under low-load conditions. Similar to the summer operation, when all parameters were adjusted during the operation phase in the intermediate season, improvements in power consumption, COP characteristics, and temperature controllability were well balanced. This suggests that these parameters collectively contribute to enhancing system performance during intermediate seasons. During winter operation, a variable change in system energy consumption, ranging from 2% to 34%, was observed, depending on the specific parameter adjustments. Notably, decreasing the minimum SA fan frequency (parameter ②) led to a significant reduction in power consumption as airflow could be effectively decreased during low-load hours. This reduction in flow rate contributed to decreased power consumption of both the ASHP and pumps on the heat source side. Conversely, reducing the coil rated power (parameter ④) increased energy consumption by extending the ASHP operation time and causing overheating. Furthermore, lowering the ASHP outlet water temperature (parameter ⑤) showed an increase in SCOP, but it also resulted in higher energy consumption as it reduced the shutdown time of the ASHP. It is worth noting that in on\u2013off control, the time required for the ASHP to stabilize its heating capacity is prolonged, resulting in a decrease in heating performance [52]. When accounting for the additional energy loss incurred by on\u2013off control, the influence of the parameters on energy consumption can become more pronounced. Conversely, reducing the minimum supply air temperature (parameter ⑥) significantly reduced ASHP power consumption on days requiring low-load heating. Diminishing the minimum SA fan frequency (parameter ②) led to reduced energy consumption, albeit with a decrease in SCOP due to the reduction in process heat. In terms of temperature controllability (MAE of temperature and ±1.0 °C control rate), diminishing the minimum SA fan frequency (parameter ②) enhanced temperature control by reducing over-heating time and enabling better temperature regulation. Likewise, reducing the minimum supply air temperature (parameter ⑥) improved temperature control on warmer days. When all parameters were adjusted in the operation phase during winter operation, energy consumption decreased, but so did the SCOP. Nonetheless, temperature controllability increased, suggesting a potential trade-off between energy efficiency and temperature control due to these parameter adjustments. The sensitivity analysis indicated that different parameters may have different impacts on the system performance under different operation seasons. While studies like Rasouli et al. [53] emphasize ventilation rate as a crucial factor for HVAC system energy consumption, the significance of uncertain parameters within control sequences can vary under different operational conditions. The dynamic nature of HVAC systems, especially in response to seasonal variations, necessitates a holistic approach to parameter optimization and system control. 4.2 Mutual impact analysis with two parameters The interaction between parameters concerning power consumption during winter, highlighting significant changes is shown in Fig. 12. The light yellow bar charts depict the change ratio in power consumption concerning the design performance when both labeled parameter numbers are updated. Meanwhile, the green bar charts demonstrate the cumulative effects of individual parameter updates. Notably, in certain instances, the light yellow bars exceed the corresponding green bars, indicating that the collective impact of multiple parameter updates on HVAC system performance can be more substantial than the simple sum of each parameter\u2019s impact. Specifically, parameters ② (Minimum SA fan frequency) and ⑤ (ASHP outlet water temperature), as well as ④ (Coil rated power) and ⑤ (ASHP outlet water temperature), exhibited changes in opposite directions. This indicates that parameter ⑤ (ASHP outlet water temperature) can act as both an energy-efficient and energy-inefficient parameter, contingent on its combination with other parameters. Therefore, accurately assessing the impact of parameter updates necessitates considering their interactions with other parameters. This underscores the necessity for a simulation platform that is capable of integrating the latest information and optimizing decisions throughout each phase of an HVAC system. 4.3 Mixed impact analysis with six parameters The influence of mixed parameters in 64 cases, each parameter having two options (before and after the update), on system performance across various operational seasons is shown in Fig. 13. Energy consumption displayed significant variation, particularly during winter operations, where three parameters exhibited an impact of over 20% on energy consumption. Within the 64 cases observed, the parameter ② (Minimum SA fan frequency) emerged as the dominant factor, exerting a substantial impact on the overall results. This dominance can be attributed to the increased demand for cooling during winter, propelled by enhanced building airtightness and the heightened prevalence of office automation equipment generating substantial heat. The SCOP also displayed significant variations during winter operations, impacted not only by changes in energy consumption but also by the variability in processed heat resulting from extended ASHP shutdown times. The results for the MAE of the temperature showed variations in temperature controllability during intermediate operation. The intermittent operation of the ASHP during low-temperature days contributed to unstable temperature control in these periods. Moreover, both the MAE of temperature and the control rate of the target temperature within ±1.0 °C exhibited significant variation in winter, particularly in four cases where temperature controllability was exceptionally poor (200 ∼ 225% of the design performance). In these instances, the limited heating capacity of the ASHP, influenced by changes in parameters ④ (Coil rated power) and ⑤ (ASHP outlet water temperature), resulted in brief periods when the room temperature exceeded the set temperature by 1 °C. Consequently, the ASHP operated almost continuously, and the air volume and temperature could not be adequately reduced during ASHP operation due to the settings of parameters ② (Minimum SA fan frequency) and ⑥ (Supply air outlet temperature range), leading to overheating. This underscores the importance of assessing parameter combinations that might potentially cause significant issues and implementing countermeasures during the design phase. Furthermore, Fig. 14 illustrates the convergence of system performance, focusing on system energy consumption and MAE of temperature (indicating energy efficiency and temperature controllability, respectively), transitioning from design to operational performance. Both performance metrics exhibit notable fluctuations during the design phase due to changes in parameters, with this variability diminishing as the system progresses through subsequent phases. This emphasizes the significance of utilizing comprehensive system simulations across the design-to-operational continuum. 5 Conclusion, limitations, and future work This study assessed the impact of uncertainty parameters on the performance of a single-zone VAV system through a comprehensive simulation-based approach. The developed physical model, covering the entire HVAC system and building, enabled the replication of system performance considering uncertain parameters associated with control strategies. Six uncertainty parameters were selected based on their potential impact on energy efficiency and temperature controllability. The study analyzed the system\u2019s response to modifications in these parameters across various operational scenarios. The principal findings are outlined below: \u2022 The results of sensitivity analysis, focusing on a single parameter, revealed that various parameters exhibit distinct impacts on system performance across different operational seasons. Specifically, during winter operations, where precise equipment control is crucial owing to low loads, a mere 10% alteration in certain parameters leads to a noteworthy escalation (up to 34%) in power consumption compared to the designed performance. \u2022 Further investigation into the mutual impacts of two parameters underscored that the effect introduced by adjusting two parameters may exceed the combined impact of individual changes. Notably, a specific parameter may contribute to either energy savings or increased energy consumption, contingent upon its interaction with other parameters. Consequently, it becomes evident that the impact of a single parameter cannot be accurately assessed unless other parameters are concurrently evaluated with the latest information. It emphasizes the importance of a holistic approach to parameter adjustments and system optimization, recognizing the intricate relationships between various factors. \u2022 In the assessment of the mixed impact of six parameters, the study identified specific parameter combinations leading to substantial deviations in temperature controllability during winter operations. This underscored the critical importance of evaluating individual parameters or their combinations that have the potential to significantly diminish HVAC system performance. Such insights are particularly crucial during the design phase, where preemptive measures can be taken to address vulnerabilities and enhance system robustness. This could involve implementing countermeasures such as refining the operating modes or adjusting parameters within the control logic. By doing so, it is possible to enhance system performance, especially during low-load winter and intermediate seasons, where precise control is paramount. \u2022 Through phased simulation analyses, beginning from the design phase and extending through the construction, installation, and operation phases, a discernible trend emerged. Initially, system performance exhibited large variations in response to parameter changes. However, as the project progressed through different phases, a convergence in system performance became evident. This emphasizes the value of continuous and detailed simulations, serving as an integrated platform for optimizing decisions in each phase and effectively communicating building performance to third parties. However, the studied system was relatively small-scale and straightforward. Real-world systems often encompass larger conveyance power, intricate circuitry, and nuanced interplays among control-related parameters. Furthermore, despite conducting simulations at 5-second intervals and analyzing data in 1-minute segments, the model assumed static system states at each time step, overlooking dynamic behaviors such as airflow diffusion, equipment startups, and sensor delays. Future work should expand the model to encompass more complex systems and develop dynamic models capable of accurately capturing these dynamic behaviors, thereby enhancing the system\u2019s response to uncertainty parameters.

        "dc:description": "During the design phase, the annual energy consumption of heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems is frequently simplified or fixed under certain assumptions due to uncertain parameters within the control sequence, resulting in a performance gap between the intended and actual performances. This study assessed the impact of six uncertain parameters on system energy consumption and indoor temperature control under various updating scenarios. First, sensitivity analysis was conducted using the one-at-a-time method to identify the influential impact of the single uncertain parameter. Then, mutual impact analysis was conducted to showcase how different parameters affect each other, and mixed impact analysis was applied to evaluate how intended design performance converges to actual operating outcomes. A detailed physical model of a single-zone variable air volume system was developed to enable a comprehensive evaluation across different operational conditions. The results indicate that a 10% change in some parameters can lead to a 20 ∼ 30% increase in energy consumption, especially during low-load winter months. Properly evaluating the influence of one parameter is difficult without taking the effects of additional parameters into account, and some combinations of parameters can significantly decrease the system performance. These results underscore the necessity of considering the updating and combination scenarios of different parameters within the control sequences during the design phase.",
