The reduced-order model (ROM) can highly reduce computation costs while maintaining high high-fidelity performance for model predictive control\u2019s application by applying the model order reduction method. However, the physical meaning of the building thermal model order reduction at the theoretical level was not been fully explored in this numerical process, although the model order reduction process and the results were unquestionable at the mathematical level. The interpretability of the building low-dimensional model at the physical level is a necessary aspect to improve the reliability of the model. The unclear numerical relationships between the key influential factors of the building's thermal property and the ROM performance identified by accuracy and computation cost implied the potential risk of ROM mismatch under certain dynamic conditions. In this research, the comprehensive research on impacts of potential key variables including the outdoor and indoor thermal frequency, radiant heating system & all-air system, building envelopes\u2019 thermal property, discretization timesteps, and model outputs on ROM\u2019s performance were investigated through detailed parametric simulations. In practical engineering, the best-performing ROM can be selected based on the frequency and amplitude of thermal disturbance fluctuations to ensure the accuracy of the ROM while minimizing the computational cost. At least one order was required to identify the indoor heat load which meant that small indoor heat load cannot be neglected in the model order reduction process and larger heat loads required ROM with more orders in consideration of model accuracy. ROMs of all-air systems with less thermal inertia were more robust to the heating power changes than that of radiant heating systems with large thermal inertia and significant time lag. Building envelope materials with the same or approximate thermal properties can be simply characterized with fewer nodes. The greater the difference in thermal properties of the envelope materials, the more orders were needed to fully identify the dynamic thermal properties of the entire structure while maintaining enough model accuracy. The ROM accuracy decreased with the increase of discretization timesteps and models with more outputs required more-order ROMs to maintain dynamic properties. Keywords Model order reduction Building thermal model High-fidelity Model computation cost Balanced truncation method Data availability The data that has been used is confidential. 1 Introduction In recent years, the model order reduction (MOR) approach has greatly promoted the application of simulation technology to real-time simulation studies, especially for the physics-based building models presented with state-space representatives where every-single envelope layer was identified with one node/state/order. The reduced-order model (ROM) can retain the dominant dynamic thermal characteristics of the building thermal model while greatly reducing the CPU (Central processing unit) computation time and storage space for complicated model simulations [1]. The MOR makes it unnecessary to choose between the computation cost and model accuracy, thus triggering a new change in simulation technology [2]. Therefore, the clarification of the interpretability mechanism of ROMs can strengthen the model reliability and ensure the great accuracy of ROMs under various working conditions, which means the numerical processing results of ROMs can be interpreted or explained at the physical level of the building. Among three typical building thermal models, the physics-based model has clearer physical interpretability and explainability without requiring a large amount of operational data of the target building in the model construction process compared to the grey-box model and black-box model [3]. The grey-box model and black-box model require a very large amount of reliable building operation data [4], for example, a 3R2C (3 thermal resistances and 2 capacitances) model with a 30-minute sampling interval required 56 days of building operation data [5], which was close to the amount of operation data for a whole heating or cooling period, and the lack of reliable data will inevitably lead to a reduction in model accuracy. Overly simplified models such as the 1R1C model [4,6], and overly complex models such as the 5R4C or 6R2C models [7,8] brought inaccurate characterization of the building dynamic properties and redundancy in the building thermal model construction and parameter identification process. Besides, it was not enough to identify the dynamic thermal performance of a radiant heating/cooling system only using the 3R2C model although the 3R2C model was applicable to general buildings, due to the complicated heat transfer process in a three-dimensional heat source embedded radiant structure [9]. The previous research found that the over-simplified 1R1C model was constructed by lumping the thermal dynamics of the zone air temperature and interior/exterior envelopes, which proved that the model\u2019s parameter identification required only 10 days of building operation data [6]. However, these 10-day operational data with 1 min or less sampling interval actually demanded more amount of data compared with relatively more complex 3R2C, which required 56-day operational data with a 30-minute sampling interval. Therefore, simpler RC (resistance\u2013capacitance) models will only require more operational data for buildings parameter identification with similar structural complexity, regardless of operational data duration and sampling interval, unless model accuracy can be sacrificed [10]. Moreover, ROMs worked mainly by integrating multiple temperature nodes with approximate dynamic thermal performance into one single temperature node, which meant that building models with multiple dynamic thermal performances need more orders or states to characterize the original model\u2019s thermal property. The over-simplified 1R1C model failed to capture the comprehensive dynamics of the interior/exterior envelopes and the zone air temperature when they were following highly different thermal dynamics [11\u201313]. That was why the radiant floor or ceiling models cannot be lumped with only several thermal resistance and heat capacity because of the large thermal inertia and delay for heat source-embeded building structurs [14,15]. Simpler models often require more operational data for model parameter estimation than complex models according to the statistical results demonstrating that different structural models such as 6R2C, 5R4C, 3R2C, and 1R1C demanded distinctive training data length with specific sampling intervals in previous studies [5]. More operational data amount used for model parameter estimation for model accuracy improvement [16]. A simplified model was often applied by the control system where a certainly sacrificed model accuracy can bring the robustness improvement of the control system [17]. All the thermal resistances and capacitances in 1R1C, 3R2C, or 6R2C models are obtained by training these models with building operational data [18], which means that these R/C parameters only characterize the thermodynamic property of the building models numerically and cannot be explained at the physical level [19]. Although the simplified RC model can provide reliable solutions for the building dynamics when sufficient and high-fidelity operational data is available, physical interpretability is necessary for a better understanding of the internal mechanism and the dynamic performance of simplified RC models [20]. This problem is similar to that of the common-used black box model, i.e., machine learning models. The lack of clarity in physical interpretability is also a major obstacle to the wider application of machine learning models [21] since accurate models with clear internal mechanisms tend to be more trustworthy in practical applications. The clear physical interpretability of the simplified RC models can help to reveal the essence of model order reduction and identify the key influential factors of building thermal dynamics [22]. The physical internal mechanism clarification is also beneficial to improve the high-fidelity property and validate whether some important factors are underestimated or some unimportant variables should be neglected in the model simplification process, which can be considered as the cross-validation for the accurate RC model construction [4,23]. To address the understanding and credibility problem of the black-box models and ROMs, the attention mechanism was introduced to improve the interpretability of the \u201cdarker model\u201d, where the internal mechanism of various inputs contributing to the model outputs can be tracked [24]. In the field of natural language processing, attention mechanisms have been widely used in various forms, offering the interpretability possibility for predictive models with clear internal mechanisms [25]. Experiments were conducted on several natural language processing tasks and found that completely different attention distributions could lead to the same predictions [26], and the research results showed that attention weights essentially cannot improve model interpretability [10,27]. However, some of the assumptions in that conclusion have also been challenged, arguing that its assertion relied on the model interpretation definition and whether the assertion correctly required a more rigorous experimental design [28,29], although the proposed four alternative tests demonstrated that the attention mechanism can provide meaningful explanations for the recurrent neural network model. The attention mechanism was also applied for the interpretability enhancement of the building cooling load prediction model in the previous research, where the color map of the attention matrix was developed to mark the key factors with a darker color and insignificant factors with a lighter color, which had an intensive and negligible correlation with the objective model, respectively [30]. However, the identified key or insignificant factors obtained by the attention mechanism can usually be forecasted based on common sense [25]. Therefore, the attention mechanism can only reveal the commonly-known significant or insignificant variables or reflect the existing simple phenomenon, which had limitations to explore the deeper and more complex physical meaning for building thermal models. In short, the existing model reduction technology failed to reveal the model simplification\u2019s essence at the physical level of building dynamics while reducing the building thermal model dimensions. Why some states in the building thermal model can be diminished and what kind of states can be deleted? These knowledge gaps have not been solved and have great significance for improving the credibility of dimensionality reduction of the building thermal model. In this research, the interpretability mechanism of model order reduction was revealed that explaining the underlying relationship of the key influential variables of building dynamic performance, while retaining ROM\u2019s accuracy and improving the computation efficiency. The interpretability mechanism clarification can help to predict ROMs\u2019 dynamic performance under different thermal disturbance frequencies and fluctuation amplitudes, building envelope configuration, thermal zone sizes, model discretization timesteps, various system forms, etc. For example, given a specific building thermal model with defined dimensional information, thermal property, and building enclosure configurations, the ROM accuracy and the computation cost can be estimated and explained for ROM with specific orders, which is beneficial to the trade-off between the ROM accuracy and computation costs considering the efficient and robust operation of the HVAC MPC (model predictive control) system. The comprehensive impact of these significant variables on ROM performance was investigated to reveal the model order reduction mechanism and improve the high fidelity of ROMs. 2 Methodology For MPC configuration simplification and computation efficiency improvement, ROMs obtained by model order reduction methods can guarantee model accuracy, while significantly reducing model dimensions and complexity compatible with the operational requirements of the control system [31]. However, the unclear numerical relationship between the thermal characteristics of the building model and ROMs\u2019 performance identified by model accuracy and computation cost [32], and the potential risk of the prediction model or ROMs mismatch can lead to a decrease in the model\u2019s reliability. The computation efficiency of ROMs is mainly influenced by the model dimensionality and discretization timestep, while the model accuracy is also related to various other factors such as the thermal properties of building envelopes, the frequency and fluctuation amplitude of thermal disturbances [33], and so on. For example, if the same first-order model is used to characterize a single thermal zone, multiple thermal zones, and radiant heating/cooling systems with heat source-embedded structures, respectively, the ROM accuracy will definitely decrease with the original model complexity. The larger the number of thermal zones and the more complex the thermodynamic properties of the original model, the higher the order number of ROMs is required. Besides, the same ROM exhibits different accuracies at different ranges of thermal disturbance frequencies. Selecting the optimal ROM perfect for MPC efficient operation is necessary at the dynamic frequency and fluctuation ranges of the thermal disturbances, of which the key issue is to identify the appropriate ROM with the smallest orders. Therefore, clarifying the influence mechanism of multiple factors such as building envelopes\u2019 thermal properties, thermal disturbances\u2019 dynamic characteristics, and model discretization timestep on ROM performance, can enhance the order reduction\u2019s reliability of building thermal models, and further provide the model basis for MPC control optimization of building air conditioning systems. Firstly, the variables affecting the ROM performance were initially determined, such as the thermal properties of building envelopes, the dynamic characteristics of thermal disturbances such as ambient temperature and solar radiation, the heat loads of occupants, lighting, and equipment, the input power of radiant heating/cooling system, the discretization timestep, the number of thermal zones, and other potential factors. Based on the dynamic ranges of the above variables, the parametric physics-based state-space models of buildings were established, respectively, and the specific modeling process can be referred to in the literature [34]. Then the original state-space models' library for building ROMs\u2019 performance studies was obtained. All the original state-space models were developed in commonly-used building simulation software (EnergyPlus) first and then were exported by the Building Resistance Capacitance Modelling (BRCM) toolbox [35]. Secondly, the balanced truncation method with great stability was selected among the commonly-used model reduction methods [36]. The original state-space model library of buildings with the above typical dynamic characteristics was analyzed for the controllability-observability performance evaluation, respectively. Then the Hankel matrices of the balanced model\u2019s observability and controllability were solved, and the parameterized ROM library based on the typical dynamic characteristics was obtained. The specific process and principle of the balanced truncation method can be referred to in the literature [37]. Finally, the time-domain and frequency-domain characteristics of the parameterized ROM library were simulated and analyzed to evaluate the potential effects of the above characteristic variables on the model accuracy and computation cost. The key influencing and negligible factors that can be ignored are screened out using the ROMs\u2019 performance as the determination indicators. Then the numerical relationships between key influencing factors and ROMs\u2019 performance were established. The inner mechanism of the building model order reduction can be further revealed for the optimal predictive model determination of MPC. The research flowchart was illustrated in Fig. 1 . 3 Performance metrics and simulation design In this research, the ROM performance of the building state-space models with different combinations of selected parameters is comprehensively evaluated by parametric simulations. The ROM performance influences the model predictive control operation in two aspects. On one hand, the lower-order model can reduce the computation cost largely while the sacrificial model accuracy can cause the predictive temperature trends to deviate from the practical conditions, leading to the degraded performance of the MPC system. On the other hand, the higher-order models can definitely capture the dynamic thermal performance of the original system, which can guarantee the MPC system\u2019s precise control commands in advance. But the redundant-order models will fail to maximize the computational efficiency improvement brought by model simplification. Therefore, the ROM performance will be evaluated in the two terms of model accuracy and computation cost, and the computation cost is completely negatively correlated with model order numbers excluding the simulation compiling time. Moreover, the obtained relationships between the ROM performance and selected variables should be explained from the physical aspect of the building heat transfer phenomenon. 3.1 Performance metrics When evaluating the accuracy performance of ROM, several indices should be considered, including the steady-state error and dynamic error of ROM, and whether there is local mutation and vibration with the change of input variables. The following typical performance metrics are used to quantify the performance of ROM accuracy. The two dimensionless error indicators of mean bias error (MBE) and the root mean square error (RMSE) [38,39] were calculated by formulae (1) and (2) in this research. (1) M B E = ∑ i = 1 N M i - S i ∑ i = 1 N M i (2) R M S E = ∑ i = 1 N ( M i - S i 2 / N ) ∑ i = 1 N M i N Where M i and S i were the simulated outputs of ROM and the original model at the instant i , which denoted the temperatures in this research, °C. N is the number count of the outputs. 3.2 Simulation design To study the effects of different characteristic parameters on the ROMs\u2019 performance, various simulation conditions under the typical dynamic range of characteristic parameters were designed, aiming at key variables determination for the order reduction of building thermal models through the simulation results. Outdoor thermal disturbances such as ambient temperature and solar radiation were first considered, of which the frequency and dynamic characteristics of these outdoor variables were close. They generally reached a maximum at noon and the ambient temperature was relatively lower. Solar radiation is distributed from 6:00 to 18:00 and no solar radiation at other times of the whole day in general. Both ambient temperatures and solar radiation varied in cycles of a day, a month, and a whole season. Ambient temperatures and solar radiation were used as input values in parametric simulations, derived from typical summer and winter design days. Secondly, indoor thermal disturbances were also considered to have a potential impact on ROMs\u2019 performance, mainly including indoor occupants, equipment, and lighting loads. All these heat loads were generally stable and there were no large fluctuations, and especially equipment and lighting loads were basically constant during fixed periods. The occupant loads followed specific dynamic characteristics at certain periods depending on the building type and function. Commercial buildings with more complex occupant flowrates were not considered in this study, and the main focus was on office buildings with the more fixed flowrates of indoor personnel. The occupant density was assigned as 0.10, 0.17, 0.25, 0.50 person / m 2 , and the corresponding occupant load were 12.50, 20.83, 31.25, 62.50 W / m 2 considering the heat load of a single person was 125 W / p e r s o n for both summer and winter conditions. Occupants were assumed as working from 9:00 ∼ 18:00 approximately and there was a dimensionless occupant coefficient, which referred to how many people were in thermal zones at specific moments. Besides, occupants' flowrates experienced a decrease at noon considering lunch and rest time in Fig. 2 . Thirdly, the input control interval and input amplitude\u2019s influence on ROMs\u2019 performance were evaluated for the radiant heating system and all-air system. The input powers\u2019 control interval was set as 300 s, 600 s, 900 s, 1200 s, 1500 s, and 1800 s, respectively, considering the possible control intervals in the practical operation of radiant heating systems. The input powers were set as 100 W / m 2 , 200 W / m 2 , 300 W / m 2 , 400 W / m 2 for step response analysis of radiant heating systems, which can evaluate ROMs\u2019 robustness against thermal disturbance\u2019s dynamic change. Besides, the all-air system was simulated under the input powers\u2019 control interval at 300 s for comparison with the radiant heating system, exploring the influence of the large inertia and heat transfer delay of the heat source-embedded structures on ROMs\u2019 performance. Then, the impact of the building envelopes\u2019 thermal property on ROMs\u2019 performance was evaluated, and the four sets of building envelopes of EnerguPlus example files (1ZoneEvapCooler.idf, 2ZoneDataCenterHVAC_wEconomizer.idf, and 4ZoneWithShading_Simple_1.idf, 5Zone_IdealLoadsAirSystems_ReturnPlenum.idf) were used for parametric simulations. Moreover, the fifth set of building envelopes desired for the energy-efficient residential buildings in hot summer and cold winter zones in China was used, of which the specific envelopes\u2019 thermal property information can be found in the literature [34]. The sixth set of building envelopes was obtained by deleting the insulation layers based on the fifth set, to investigate whether the insulation layer had a significant influence on ROMs\u2019 performance. All the material specifications and thermal properties of six sets of building constructions were attached in the appendix. Finally, the discretization timestep of ROMs was evaluated to find out whether ROMs with a larger discretization timestep sacrifice the model accuracy by parametric simulations. It should be noticed that the ROMs\u2019 discretization timestep must be an integer multiple of the simulation timestep. Therefore, ten simulation conditions were designed as shown in Table 1 . 4 Results and discussion 4.1 Outdoor thermal disturbances The full 23-order model of the fourth set of building envelopes was truncated, and 1-order to 8-order ROMs were obtained based on the Hankel singular values (HSVs), which indicated that the maximum 8 orders need to be retained for carrying the dynamic thermal characteristics of the original model. MBE and RMSE of the 1-order to 8-order ROMs of the full 23-order model of a single thermal zone were illustrated in Fig. 3 . T z , T f , T rf denoted the zone air temperature, floor inside surface temperature, and roof inside surface temperature. T w 1 , T w 2 , T w 3 , T w 4 referred to internal surface temperatures of four walls. The ROM accuracy decreased as the reserved order number decreased, while the 2-order to 8-order models can almost fully capture the dynamic characteristics. However, the RMSE of the floor surface temperature of the 1-order model surged from less than 1% to 10.04%, and the RMSE of the internal surface temperatures of other walls also experienced a significant increase, which resulted from that the floor surface\u2019s boundary condition was set as adiabatic and that of other walls were set as outdoors. In general, the zone air temperatures of ROMs had lower errors compared with the other internal surface temperatures due to the former derived from the combined effects of all other envelopes and environmental conditions. Therefore, the zone air temperatures possessed a near-average or lesser error than other surface temperatures. The decreased accuracy of the 1-order model was caused by the degraded robustness to dynamic fluctuations of interior and exterior thermal disturbances. In other words, the less order was retained, the greater the sensitivity to dynamic fluctuations of interior and exterior thermal disturbances. Once the frequency of the interior and exterior thermal disturbance\u2019s dynamic fluctuation exceeded the lowest limit that the ROM can afford, the model will mismatch and cannot capture the dynamic property of the original model, which can be explained by the HSVs versus the frequency of thermal disturbances as shown in Fig. 5(d). The discrete Fourier transform was used to perform a spectral analysis of the outdoor thermal disturbances to which the thermal zone was subjected. The outdoor thermal disturbances were decomposed into a series of linear combinations of temperature harmonics of different frequencies, and the amplitude spectrums of the thermal disturbances were derived. Only typical exterior thermal disturbances were analyzed and explained in this section and a more comprehensive analysis of various internal thermal disturbances was conducted in the following section. The spectrum results of the ambient temperature and solar radiation during the simulation periods were shown in Fig. 4 . The spectral analysis results demonstrated that the dominant frequency of the ambient temperature was 7.27221 × 10 - 5 rad/s, of which the corresponding dominant period was 24 h. similarly, the dominant frequencies of solar radiation in different orientations were 7.272 × 10 - 5 , 1.454 × 10 - 4 , 2.182 × 10 - 4 2.909 × 10 - 4 , 4.363 × 10 - 4 , 5.818 × 10 - 4 rad/s, respectively, of which the corresponding dominant periods were 24 h, 12 h, 8 h, 6 h, 4 h, and 3 h. The spectrum analysis results were consistent with those of T. Weber et al [40]. The frequency-domain singular values and HSVs of the full-order model and ROMs among the ambient temperature and solar radiation\u2019s domain frequency ranges were illustrated in Fig. 5 . HSVs define the \u201cenergy\u201d of each state of the system in control theory. Keeping larger energy states of a system can preserve most of its characteristics in terms of stability, dynamics, and robustness. Model reduction methods such as the balanced truncation method can work based on the HSVs of a system, which can achieve the model structure simplification without sacrificing model accuracy. The HSVs showed that the full-order modelhas most of its \u201cenergy\u201d stored in states 1 to 3 approximately and at least 8-order ROM can preserve nearly all of its dynamic response properties. The 13-order ROM had the generally same outputs\u2019 singular values, while the 1-order ROM failed to capture the dynamic property of the surface temperatures and only the zone air temperature kept the same frequency-domain response with the full-order model. The recommended 8-order ROM obtained a highly similar frequency-domain response with negligible errors. It\u2019s worth mentioning that lower-order ROMs were also appropriate alternatives for MPC employment [41] since the sacrificed model accuracy can bring lower computation costs and more efficient operation of building HVAC control systems. 4.2 Internal thermal disturbances The internal thermal disturbances including the occupant, equipment, and lighting load had highly different features during one whole day compared with the ambient temperatures and solar radiations, although they shared the same impact on the ROM performance with the external thermal disturbances in terms of the frequency distribution range. Therefore, the occupant load under different people density conditions, relatively fixed equipment, and lighting loads were considered in the parametric simulations. The fourth set of building envelopes was used for simulation and the zone air temperature as the only output of the original model and ROMs were analyzed. The zone air temperature distributions under occupant condition (1) on (a) a winter day and (b) a summer day were shown in Fig. 6 (a) and (b). ROM6 and ROM5 which represented that six and five orders were retained had great consistency with the original model, and ROM4 and ROM3 had a few discrepancies with the original model while greater discrepancies occurred for ROM2. Then ROM1 showed the largest error with the original one and the maximum error between them reached about 1 °C. It\u2019s obvious that the discrepancy between ROM and the original model under relatively steady conditions, which was shown during the periods of 0:00 ∼ 6:00 in Fig. 6(a), was much less than that under unsteady conditions like temperature increasing and dropping periods from 8:00 ∼ 20:00. The same phenomenon can be observed in Fig. 6(b). Higher ROM accuracy under steady conditions meant that fewer orders were sufficient to identify the original model\u2019s performance and more orders were required for unsteady conditions, which depended on the practical application. RMSEs of ROMs under four occupant conditions on a winter day and summer day were shown in Fig. 6(c) and (d), showing that ROM\u2019s RMSE was much larger on winter days than that on summer days. The absolute errors between ROM and the original model were similar while the smaller temperature caused the larger relative error on winter days shown in Fig. 6(a) and (b). To further evaluate the occupant loads\u2019 influence on ROM accuracy, the four occupants' conditions for building areas with 100 m 2 , 200 m 2 , 300 m 2 , 400 m 2 was simulated. ROM6 and ROM5 were highly consistent with the original model and only ROM1 ∼ ROM4\u2032s RMSEs were illustrated in Fig. 7 . The simulation results of occupant condition (1) ∼ 3 indicated a similar RMSE and ROMs with 400 m 2 -building areas had the largest RMSEs, because the occupants' load increased 2.5 times from occupant condition 1 to 3, while that increased 4 times from the building area of 100 m 2 to 400 m 2 . The largest ROM\u2019s RMSE under occupant condition 4 also demonstrated that ROM with a larger occupant load had lower model accuracy. Besides, the ROM1 had the irregular but worst accuracy performance because the 1-order model failed to capture the original model\u2019s dynamic performance at this time, and occupant loads were not the main factors influencing the model precision. Moreover, at least 3 orders were required when the thermal zone was unoccupied, and at least 4 orders were demanded when the thermal zone was occupied under conditions 1 to 4 if the ROM error remained close to 0. Therefore, at least 1 order was demanded to characterize the internal occupant load regardless of the building size. The lighting and equipment loads were close to the case of occupant conditions (1) and (2), so no further analysis will be performed there. 4.3 The radiant heating system and all-air system The input control interval and input amplitude\u2019s influence on ROM performance were evaluated for the radiant heating system and all-air system, of which the input variables referred to the heating power of the radiant floor and the supplied air, respectively. The sixth set of building envelopes was used for the parametric simulation in this section. The zone air temperature of ROMs and RMSEs for ROM 2 ∼ 6 under different heating power\u2019s control intervals was displayed in Fig. 8 . ROM5 and ROM6 can greatly match with the original model under all heating power\u2019s control interval, and the zone air temperatures under 300 s-control interval were shown in Fig. 8(a) for example analysis. Only the simulation results of ROM2 ∼ 6 were illustrated here for further analysis due to the sharp increase of RMSE of ROM1 compared with other ROMs. It can be seen that the model accuracy of ROM5 and ROM6 decreased with the increase of the heating power\u2019s control interval. In contrast, the smaller the heating power\u2019s control interval, the lower the model accuracy for ROM2 ∼ 4. ROM accuracy of ROMs obviously turned at ROM 4, which also explained that the discrepancy between the zone air temperature and the original model occurred for ROM1 to 4. Since the larger discrepancy between the zone air temperature and the original model first occurred after ROM4, the zone air temperature distributions under different heating power frequencies were further compared and analyzed, as shown in Fig. 9 . It can be seen that the zone air temperatures experienced a huge oscillation each time the temperature reached the maximum and minimum values when the heating power\u2019s control intervals were 300 s, 600 s, and 900 s, which was also consistent with the previous conclusion that the ROM accuracy decreased under the unsteady state compared with steady state. However, the zone air temperature oscillations were significantly alleviated as the heating power\u2019s control interval increased to 1200 s, 1500 s, and 1800 s, and the temperatures were more stable and matched with the results of the original model. The phenomenon that the zone air temperature oscillations decreased with the increase of heating power\u2019s control interval was consistent with RMSE results. The model accuracy of ROM2 ∼ 4 improved with the increase of heating power\u2019s control interval while ROM1 mismatched with the original model totally. The zone temperature distributions of ROMs and the original model for radiant heating systems under different heating power amplitudes were shown in Fig. 10 , where only simulation results of ROM2 ∼ 6 were displayed and compared with the original model. Four pulse signals of heating powers were given to the original model and ROMs of the radiant heating system at 14:00. The zone air temperatures of ROM5, ROM6, and the original model began to rise at the same time, and ROM4\u2032s temperature experienced a sudden oscillation firstly and then began to rise steadily, while ROM2 and ROM3 suddenly dropped sharply before the temperature rise. All model temperatures reached the peak after about one hour when ROM2 ∼ 5 had temperature overshoots from 0.1 °C to 1 °C at the highest point and the temperature overshoots increased from ROM5 to ROM 2. The temperature overshoots of ROMs increased with the heating power from 100 W / m 2 to 400 W / m 2 . RMSEs for ROM 2 ∼ 6 under different heating power\u2019s amplitudes were shown in Fig. 8(c). It can be seen that the RMSE of ROM2 was the smallest and the RMSE of ROM6 was the largest. The heating power's amplitudes had almost no effect on the accuracy of ROM5 and ROM6 because they can almost completely capture the dynamic performance of the original model. The model accuracy of ROM2 ∼ 4 decreased with the increase of the heating power's amplitudes. To investigate whether the heating power influence the ROM accuracy of all-air systems and radiant heating systems in a different manner, the simulation results of the zone air temperature distributions of ROM2 ∼ 6 and the original model for the all-air system and the radiant heating system were shown in Fig. 11 (a) and (b). It can be illustrated that the zone air temperature fluctuation of the radiant heating system was significantly smaller than that of the all-air system, which was caused by the larger thermal inertia of the radiant system. In this study, the most unfavorable condition of the heating power control interval of 300 s was selected to compare the ROMs accuracy of both systems. In Fig. 11(a), the zone air temperatures of ROM2 ∼ 4 of the all-air system had no oscillations and delays at the maximum and minimum heating power only with the temperature overshoots, which increased significantly with the decrease of the ROM orders. In contrast, the zone air temperatures of ROM2 ∼ 4 of the radiant system experienced significant oscillations and overshoots in Fig. 11(b), which also increased with the decrease of the ROM orders. This demonstrated that the original model and ROMs of all-air systems with less thermal inertia were more robust to the heating power\u2019s dynamic changes than that of radiant heating systems. 4.4 Building envelope thermal property As there were many types of building envelopes and more combinations of the wall, ceiling, floor, and other structures, only 6 sets of building envelopes were selected for demonstration research in this study. All the material specifications and thermal properties of six sets of building construction were attached in the appendix. RMSEs of ROMs and original models of different sets of building envelopes were shown in Fig. 12 (a). For all Sets of building envelopes, the model accuracy of ROM3 ∼ 6 remained lower than 0.01. ROM1 ∼ 3 had the relatively low RMSEs below 0.02 for Set 1, 3, 4, and 6 while ROM1 ∼ 3\u2032s RMSEs for Set 2 and 5 showed higher model errors, where ROM 1 was almost distorted and failed to capture the dynamic property of the original model. It can be seen that the ROM error of the Set 2 of building envelopes (the original model with 19 orders) was the largest with ROM1\u2032s RMSE close to 0.05. Next, the second and third largest model errors were Set 5 (the original model with 27 orders) and Set 6 (the original model with 34 orders) respectively, with ROM2\u2032s RMSE close to 0.02. There was little difference in the ROM accuracy between Set 5 and Set 6 because the two sets of building envelopes shared the same other material layers except for the insulation layer, which meant that the insulation layer had little impact on the ROM accuracy for Set 5 and Set 6. Then, the third and fourth largest model errors were Set 3 (the original model with 22 orders) and Set 4 (the original model with 23 orders), respectively, with ROM1 ∼ 3\u2032s RMSEs close to zero. The dynamic performance of the original model can be almost fully characterized even only using ROM2 for Set 4. Finally, the first set of building envelopes with the highest accuracy of ROMs hardly showed almost no errors when only ROM1 was enough to identify the dynamic performance of the original model due to only 7 orders of the original model. It can be seen from the above results analysis that the accuracy of ROMs was not only related to the original model dimensions but also related to the thermal performance of the building envelopes because the original model of Set 2 with only 19 orders (the highest order of ROM was 34 for Set 6) had much lower accuracy than that of other sets. Set 1, Set 2, and Set 3 with the minimum, maximum, and moderate ROM errors were selected as examples, as shown in Fig. 12(b), (c), (d), where all temperature states of the original models of Set 1, Set 2, and Set 3 of building envelopes were analyzed. For example, there were 7 temperature curves, each corresponding to an order, which represented a building envelope material layer in Fig. 12(b). Similarly, 19 and 22 temperature curves were illustrated for Set 2 and Set 3 in Fig. 12(c) and (d), respectively. The seven temperature states of the original model of Set 1 fluctuated at the same frequency during the temperature rise stage, with no significant difference in amplitude. In the relative steady-state phase (0:00 ∼ 6:00), all the temperature states followed the same trend with a maximum temperature difference of about 4 °C. However, the fluctuation frequency of each temperature state of the original model of Set 2 differed greatly and the maximum difference in fluctuation amplitude was about 20 °C during the temperature rise stage. In the relative steady-state phase (0:00 ∼ 6:00), the temperature trends of Set 2 varied widely and the maximum temperature difference was close to 15 °C. The same phenomenon occurred for Set 3, while the maximum difference in fluctuation amplitude was about 25 °C for Set 3 during the temperature rise stage. However, the temperature trends were relatively consistent and the maximum difference was only 8 °C for Set 3 in the relative steady-state phase (0:00 ∼ 6:00). Therefore, the thermal performance of the building envelopes affected all the temperature distributions of the original model and ROM performance. The closer thermal properties of the building envelope materials resulted in a more approximate temperature curve of the original model in terms of frequency, amplitude, and fluctuation range. Such similar temperature states sharing the same response performance during steady and unsteady stages can be integrated and represented by a single temperature state without compromising model accuracy. The more temperature states were approximated, the more temperature states can be integrated in MOR, and then the less order need to be retained to capture the dynamic property of the building thermal model. 4.5 Discretization timestep To study the influence of ROM\u2019s discretization timestep on model accuracy, the ROM performance under different discretization time steps and simulation timesteps was simulated and evaluated. RMSEs of ROM 1\u20136 under different discretization and simulation timesteps were shown in Fig. 13 . The building envelopes of Set 6 were used for simulation. The parametric simulation conditions were arranged as above since the simulation timestep must be an integral multiple of the ROM discretization timestep. As shown in Fig. 13(a) when the simulation timestep was 300 s, the accuracy of ROM3 ∼ 6 decreased with the increase of discretization timestep. For ROM2, all ROMs accuracy reached the same value while discretization timesteps were arranged from the 300 s to 1800 s. However, the ROM1 accuracy increased with the increase of discretization timesteps completely opposite to ROM3 ∼ 6, which resulted from the fact that ROM1 was already in a mismatched state. As shown in Fig. 13(b) when the simulation timestep was 600 s, the dynamic performance and RMSEs of ROM1 ∼ 6 under different discretization timesteps were consistent with that of 300 s-simulation timesteps and the model accuracy under all discretization timesteps at ROM2 was the same before ROM1 was mismatched. As displayed in Fig. 13(c) when the simulation timestep was 900 s, and the dynamic performance and RMSEs of ROM accuracy with the discretization timesteps turned at ROM2 although the ROM2 accuracy had a slight difference under different simulation timesteps. As illustrated in Fig. 13(d), the accuracy of ROM1 ∼ 6 with an 1800 s-discretization timestep was compared under the simulation timesteps of 300 s, 600 s, and 900 s respectively. The precision performance of ROM1 ∼ 6 was completely consistent under simulation timesteps of 300 s and 600 s, while RMSEs of ROM3 ∼ 6 under 900 s also followed the completely same trends as that of 300 s and 600 s. Only ROM1 and ROM2 showed different accuracy performances, which can also be explained by the model mismatch. In general, the ROM accuracy decreased with the increase of discretization timesteps. However, there was no straight correlation between the simulation timestep and ROMs with relatively high accuracy when the RMSE was less than 0.005. The above conclusions cannot be drawn out for ROM mismatch conditions. 4.6 Model output quantity Four-zone models were constructed for evaluation of model output quantity\u2019s impact on ROM accuracy and every single zone was different in dimensional size. The Set 4 of building envelopes was used for simulations and the four thermal zone\u2019s dimensional sizes can refer to \u201c4ZoneWithShading_Simple_1.idf\u201d in Energyplus example files. The first simulation condition was that the four-zone model output only four zone air temperatures, while the second simulation condition was that every single-zone model output zone air temperature and six interior surface temperatures, and a total of 24 temperature states were output due to three adjacent partitions. The RMSE comparisons of ROM1 ∼ 8 with different output numbers were displayed in Fig. 14 . T z denoted the zone air temperature and T aves denoted the average interior surface temperatures. The four zone air temperatures of the 4-output ROM and the four average temperatures of every single zone of the 24-output ROM were demonstrated in Fig. 14(a). The four zone air temperatures and average interior surface temperatures of the 24-output ROM were showed in Fig. 14(b). As seen in Fig. 14(a), RMSEs of 24-output ROM increased suddenly when the retained order decreased to four states, while that of 4-output ROM started to increase substantially when the kept order decreased to three states, which means that the 24-output ROM required one more order than the 4-output ROM to maintain the comparative model accuracy. As shown in Fig. 14(b), RMSEs of T z were lower than that of T aves for ROM5 ∼ 8. RMSEs of T z and T aves had little difference and experienced insignificant change with model orders for ROM2 ∼ 4, while RMSE of ROM1 increased significantly. Therefore, ROMs with more outputs required more order to keep the dynamic property, and the less ROM output, the lower the ROM\u2019s computation cost. 5 Conclusion In this research, the impacts of potential key variables on ROMs\u2019 performance identified by model accuracy and computation efficiency were investigated for interpretability clarification of building thermal model order reduction by time-domain and frequency-domain analysis. The ROMs\u2019 performance was comprehensively decided by the dynamic characteristics of the original building thermal model, and the optimal ROM can be determined based on the trade-off between desired ROM accuracy and the minimum computation cost in applications of MPC. More-order ROMs were demanded under dynamic conditions compared with that under steady conditions for the sake of the comparative model accuracy. At least 1 order was required to characterize the occupant load and ROMs with more orders can capture the dynamic property of larger occupant loads. The zone air temperatures of ROM5 and ROM6 can greatly match with the original model under all heating power control intervals from 300 s to 1800 s, while the model accuracy of ROM2 ∼ 4 improved with the increase of heating power\u2019s control intervals. Smaller control intervals caused the zone air temperatures\u2019 large oscillation, which meant MPC systems with smaller control intervals demanded higher-order ROMs to guarantee the model accuracy and the control system\u2019s robustness. The heating power had little impact on the ROMs\u2019 accuracy can be neglected when ROMs 5 and 6 were sufficient to fully characterize the dynamic performance of the original building thermal model. However, the model accuracy for ROMs 2 ∼ 4 decreased with the increase of the heating power due to the appearance of temperature oscillations and overshoot. The original model and ROMs of all-air systems with less thermal inertia were more robust to the heating power\u2019s dynamic changes than that of radiant heating systems with larger thermal inertia. The similar thermal performance of building envelopes led to more approximate temperature states\u2019 integration and a significant reduction in model complexity, while maintaining the same model accuracy. The ROMs\u2019 accuracy decreased with the increase of discretization timesteps and relatively high-accurate ROM models\u2019 performance with RMSEs less than 0.005 would barely degrade with the simulation timesteps\u2019 increase. More-order ROMs were required to maintain the dynamic properties of the original building thermal models with more outputs. The interpretability mechanism of building thermal models\u2019 order reduction is beneficial to improve the ROMs\u2019 reliability and MPC system\u2019s efficient operation, although investigating the specific conditions with the other factors considered should be extended in future work.

        "dc:description": "The reduced-order model (ROM) can highly reduce computation costs while maintaining high high-fidelity performance for model predictive control\u2019s application by applying the model order reduction method. However, the physical meaning of the building thermal model order reduction at the theoretical level was not been fully explored in this numerical process, although the model order reduction process and the results were unquestionable at the mathematical level. The interpretability of the building low-dimensional model at the physical level is a necessary aspect to improve the reliability of the model. The unclear numerical relationships between the key influential factors of the building's thermal property and the ROM performance identified by accuracy and computation cost implied the potential risk of ROM mismatch under certain dynamic conditions. In this research, the comprehensive research on impacts of potential key variables including the outdoor and indoor thermal frequency, radiant heating system & all-air system, building envelopes\u2019 thermal property, discretization timesteps, and model outputs on ROM\u2019s performance were investigated through detailed parametric simulations. In practical engineering, the best-performing ROM can be selected based on the frequency and amplitude of thermal disturbance fluctuations to ensure the accuracy of the ROM while minimizing the computational cost. At least one order was required to identify the indoor heat load which meant that small indoor heat load cannot be neglected in the model order reduction process and larger heat loads required ROM with more orders in consideration of model accuracy. ROMs of all-air systems with less thermal inertia were more robust to the heating power changes than that of radiant heating systems with large thermal inertia and significant time lag. Building envelope materials with the same or approximate thermal properties can be simply characterized with fewer nodes. The greater the difference in thermal properties of the envelope materials, the more orders were needed to fully identify the dynamic thermal properties of the entire structure while maintaining enough model accuracy. The ROM accuracy decreased with the increase of discretization timesteps and models with more outputs required more-order ROMs to maintain dynamic properties.",
