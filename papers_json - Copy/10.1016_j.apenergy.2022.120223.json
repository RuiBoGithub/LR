School of Software Engineering, Tongji University Shanghai China Buildings represent 39% of global greenhouse gas emissions, thus reducing carbon emissions in buildings is of importance to greenhouse gas emissions reductions. This requires understanding how electricity is utilized in the buildings, then optimizing electricity management to seek conservation of energy. Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) is a technique that disaggregates a house\u2019s total load to estimate each appliance\u2019s electric power usage. Several strategies for estimating one appliance at a time (one-to-one model) have been presented and experimentally proven to be effective, with two mainstream trends: appliance transfer learning and cross-domain transfer learning. The former refers to the transfer between different types of appliances in the same data domain, while the latter refers to the transfer between different data domains for the same type of appliance. Different from the previous work, this paper explores the approach of adopting one model for all appliances (one-to-many model) and proposes a novel transfer learning scheme, that incorporates appliance transfer learning and cross-domain transfer learning. Thus, a well-trained model can be transferred and utilized to effectively estimate the power consumption in another data set for all appliances, which demands fewer measurements and only one model. Three public data sets, REFIT, REDD, and UK-DALE, are used in our experiments. Further, a set of smart electricity meters was deployed in a practical non-residential building to validate the proposed method. The results demonstrate the accuracy and practicality compared to start-of-the-art one-to-one NILM transferred models. Keywords NILM Energy disaggregation Transfer learning One-to-many model Data availability Data will be made available on request. 1 Introduction Climate change has been raised as one of the great threats and as such attracts global attention [1,2]. To mitigate the negative effects of climate change, it is urgently required to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and approach net-zero targets [3]. In reaching net-zero targets, buildings play a crucial role, as buildings represent 39% of global greenhouse gas emissions [4]. This requires understanding how electricity is utilized in the buildings, then optimizing electricity management to seek conservation of energy [5]. Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) is a cost-effective and promising approach that enables estimating individual building loads without a need for separate, appliance metering. It aims at disaggregating the total energy consumption of a building down to individual appliances [6,7], improving appliance anomaly detection [8] and facilitating effective energy feedback [9]. In recent years, the research on NILM has been intensified due to practical demands (improving energy efficiency and meeting global climate change targets) and the availability of data via massive roll-out of smart meters [10]. From the perspective of data usage, NILM can be divided into high-frequency and low-frequency approaches according to the sampling frequency of the raw data [11]. High-frequency data has the apparent advantages due to the large information content available for processing. As presented in [12], with high-frequency data, it is even possible to distinguish identical appliances. However, the high frequency requires high cost for both hardware dedicated infrastructure, extra installation effort as well as data storage and processing. In recent years, with the pervasive roll-out of low-frequency smart meters, NILM research tends to explore low-frequency approaches [13]. Various NILM approaches established on low-frequency data can be roughly classified into event-based and non event-based categories depending on whether or not there is a clear state change detection [14]. In the previous research, the event-based methods are the main trend [15]. The work in [16] proposed a multi-class classification model that uses current shapelets to extract features of each appliance. The work in [17] proposed a graph signal processing based method for NILM, based on which [18] proposed a training-less solution. With a large availability of data for training models, recently, deep learning-based methods have been popular for NILM as non-event-based methods. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for sequence-to-point NILM, disaggregating one appliance at a time, was first proposed in [19]. Furthermore, the work in [20] proposed a fully-convolutional denoising auto-encoder architecture for large non-residential buildings. In addition, the work in [21] employed a 3-layers CNN architecture for NILM, which can estimate the electricity consumption of multiple appliances simultaneously. Though a large number of network architectures have been proposed in the literature, there are still clear gaps between academic research and practical application: (1) Data Scarcity: The lack of labeled data is an open issue for NILM [22], since gathering sufficient training data takes a long time in practice. How to use less training data in practical applications while maintaining accuracy remains a challenge [13]. (2) Model Complexity: Complex approaches often require high computing power, which limits the large-scale application of models [23]. To address the aforementioned challenges, this paper proposes a one-to-many model transfer strategy, building upon initial results from our conference paper [24]. The first challenge is addressed via an architecture optimized for transfer learning (transferring the knowledge of the same appliances among different datasets). The second challenge is addressed by having a single network for all appliances, training and testing a single model for the entire household, instead of one model per appliance. The performance is verified on three public data sets (REFIT [25], REDD [26], and UK-DALE [27]). In particular, the proposed workflow contains three steps: pre-training using labeled source data, retraining of the last two dense layers utilizing the target data, and fine-tuning the CNN layers with the target data. Fair comparisons with the state-of-the-art transfer learning model [28] are further provided to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach. To demonstrate the efficiency of the network for real-time NILM processing, we equipped a non-residential building with energy meters and disaggregate six appliances: washer, fridge, air conditioner, server, freezer, and a central air conditioner (CAC). The proposed model is trained with REFIT data, and then retrained and fine-tuned with the collected data. Promising results were obtained after the practical test and application. The key contributions of this paper are three-fold: 1. A one-to-many NILM model is designed (one model for all appliances), which significantly reduces the model size and the complexity of NILM for multiple appliances. 2. A transfer one-to-many NILM model is first proposed. Thus, a well-trained model can be transferred to be used for another data set, effectively estimating power consumption for all appliances, with fewer measurements and less training. 3. A novel metric, Overall Disaggregation Proportion Error (ODPE), is defined to measure the disaggregation error of each type of electrical appliance from the perspective of load ratio. We organized the paper as follows. Section 2 provides an elaborate discussion of multi-object learning and transfer learning for NILM. Section 3 starts by describing how meters and devices are deployed in buildings for NILM, and the formulation of the NILM problem. Section 4 introduces the proposed model to address the one-to-many NILM problem and transfer learning in the NILM problem. Section 5 follows up with a detailed experimental design, experimental dataset, metrics, and results. Finally, the conclusions and future work are presented in Section 6. 2 Related work NILM has been extensively studied as a tool that can support energy management, smart home automation, and demand response measures [15,29]. Here we provide an elaborate discussion about the related work on multi-task learning and transfer learning for NILM. 2.1 Multi-object learning For practical NILM applications, a multi-object classification model is often a desirable option because it requires fewer parameters to optimize, and requires less training time, fewer computational resources and less storage demands. Consequently, a few studies have investigated multi-object classification for NILM [30]. The work in [31] provided a complete NILM architecture containing event type classification, load identification, event sample detection, and the multi-classification. The work in [23] applied Signal2Vec dimensionality reduction for NILM multi-object classification. The work in [32] used a combination of multi-object classification and convolutional transfer learning for NILM. See [33] for a review of existing multi-object classification algorithms. Overall, the state-of-the-art multi-object classification methods produce promising results, but some challenges remain. Indeed, the above approaches require large amounts of labeled appliance power data [34]. To address this problem, transfer learning is used in the NILM model to reduce the amount of required training data. In the following, the data used to pre-train the model is referred to as source data, while the data to be disaggregated is referred to as target data. Transfer learning models, in general, learn and store knowledge from source data before applying it to target data. 2.2 Transfer learning As reviewed in [13], the transferring models are great opportunities to tackle the problem of data scarcity. Currently, the research on the application of transfer learning in NILM is limited. As the inception of transfer learning for the NILM task, the work in [35] firstly designed two data-driven deep learning-based architectures (CNN and GRU) for NILM. Cross-domain transfer learning was applied to REFIT, UK-DALE, and REDD datasets. Across all three datasets, both networks predict state and consumption; a significant performance loss is observed when training and testing datasets are different. Another transfer learning scheme, appliance-domain transfer learning, was proposed in [28]. The work in [28] employed a one-to-one transferring model, which can predict one appliance at a time. Further, the work in [36] proposed a transfer learning-based NILM model, which uses a long short-term memory neural network to extract features and then classify the appliance type with a probabilistic neural network. This model can infer the appliance type with limited measurement, however, it needs prior knowledge of electrical appliances, e.g., rated power. Meta-learning is the second kind of transfer learning model, based on which [37] was proposed. Using the source data, this model pre-trained the parameters to identify more general initial parameters for a quick training with target data. Nonetheless, instead of fine-tuning, it focuses on training a new generic model, which is then used to estimate one appliance at a time. Despite the above progress, NILM still faces the following challenges, which can be addressed by our proposed method: 1. Current multi-object models mainly focus on a few typical appliances rather than all the appliances in the circuit. It is not clear whether all the appliances in a data set can be disaggregated with an adaptive single model, i.e., using one model for all appliances (one-to-many model) instead of one model for each appliance or a few typical appliances. 2. It is unclear whether this one-to-many model can be made transferable and how it compares with the one-to-one transferability model. Additionally, very little attention has been devoted to transfer learning based on one-to-many models for NILM. 3 Problem formulation Understanding how electricity is used in buildings at the appliance level is necessary for improving energy efficiency [38]. There are two main options for estimating the electric power consumption of each appliance: (a) installing a meter at each appliance and (b) using the NILM method [39]. Compared with the former method, NILM\u2019s main advantage is the requirement for only one single electric meter deployed to monitor the overall load, as illustrated in Fig. 1. The main meter is connected to the indoor electricity distribution bin, which is connected directly to each electrical appliance without electricity meters between them. The main meter power measurement at time stamp t , y t , can be expressed as: (1) y t = ∑ i = 1 N x t ( i ) + ϵ , where N denotes the number of known appliances in the building, and x t ( i ) is the electric consumption of appliance i at time stamp t . ϵ represents the noise which includes measurement noise and all unknown load; it is usually modeled as a random variable with Gaussian distribution. The task of NILM is to estimate x t ( i ) given y t for each time stamp t . The conventional, one-model-for-one appliance (one-to-one) model estimates x t ( i ) for each i , independently from other x t ( j ) , j ≠ i ; that is, a separate model is built for each appliance and NILM classification is executed N times. Some methods then perform correction step to ensure that the sum of the estimated loads is below the aggregate y t . On the other hand, the proposed one-to-many model estimates x t ( i ) for all i in one pass, without requiring separate models for each appliance. 4 Proposed approach Following recent trends [13], and capitalizing on a large amount of open access electrical measurements data, in this paper, a novel deep learning-based NILM method is proposed. In contrast to existing methods, the proposed method offers high transferrability of the model (reducing the labeling effort) and low complexity. In this section, first, we describe the classical sequence-to-point architecture and one-to-one model, then focus on the proposed one-to-many model and its design, and last introduce the adaptive domain transfer learning strategy. 4.1 Sequence-to-point (seq2point) architecture In a seq2point architecture, the raw data is divided into short time windows (i.e., sequences), and the data from each window of the main electricity meter is used to estimate the power consumption of the targeted appliance at the window\u2019s midpoint using a neural network [40]. The model can be expressed as (2) x ˆ t 0 ( i ) = f ( i ) ( y τ ) + ϵ , where y τ ( τ = 1 , \u2026 , T ) represents the τ -th window of the input aggregate data, and T is the number of windows. ϵ represents the model noise and x ˆ t 0 ( i ) is the output of the model, i.e., the estimated power for appliance i at t 0 , which is the middle point of the window τ . f ( i ) ( ⋅ ) is a mapping function of y τ to x ˆ t 0 ( i ) for appliance i and it is different for each appliance. For each appliance, the model\u2019s output is based on the maximizing model\u2019s aposteriori probability and can be formulated as: (3) max ∏ τ = 1 T p ( x ˆ t 0 ( i ) ∣ y τ , θ i ) , where θ i denotes the entire network parameters for appliance i , and each appliance requires such a model. The One-to-one (one model for one appliance) model for solving Eq. (3) builds a separate model θ i for each appliance. This one-to-one model-based method is widely adapted in most recent NILM architectures [18,28,41], where one model is trained for each appliance to increase the likelihood of correctly predicting a certain type of appliance. 4.2 One-to-many model In this paper, we improve disaggregation efficiency by using a one-to-many (one model for many appliances) structure. The model takes into account all N appliances at the same time, resulting in the following problem formulation: (4) max ∏ τ = 1 T p ( x ˆ t 0 ( 1 ) , x ˆ t 0 ( 2 ) , \u2026 , x ˆ t 0 ( N ) ∣ y τ , θ ) , where p ( x ˆ t 0 ( 1 ) , x ˆ t 0 ( 2 ) , \u2026 , x ˆ t 0 ( N ) ∣ y τ , θ ) is a joint conditional probability density function of all N appliances for each window τ . θ denotes the overall network parameters of the NILM model. Therefore, the one-to-many model requires only one model for all appliances, and requires less storage and computational resources. In order to solve the NILM problem represented by Eq. (4), we provide an efficient CNN architecture that constructs the one-to-many model to estimate all appliances in the household in one run of the network using one model. The continuous recorded main power consumptions are divided into T time-windows, each containing 2 t 0 + 1 samples. Thus the input data has the shape of T ∗ ( 2 t 0 + 1 ) ∗ 1 . The total units in the output layer are denoted as N , which is set by the number of appliances to be disaggregated. The designed CNN architecture, as shown in Fig. 2, consists of four convolution layers that capture time-dependent information in the receptive field. Fig. 2 shows the filter size, stride, and padding that we employed in all simulations. 4.3 Adaptive domain transfer learning The model described in the previous subsection relies on the network\u2019s generalization ability, and is expected to work well if the test data distribution follows well the training data distribution. This is a reasonable assumption if training and test datasets are generated from the same domain [22], which in the context of this paper, means the same building [28]. Cross-domain transfer learning therefore can be described as the model trained on one building and tested on another building. Further, we consider if the NILM model developed for one domain can be reused as the initial point for a model on another domain. Source domain refers to the collected training data and usually, is a large data set. The target domain is the data to be disaggregated (i.e., test dataset). To design a model that generalizes well across different but similar domains, i.e., that enables transfer learning, we adapt the approach proposed in [28] as shown in Fig. 3. The first 4 layers learn generic features from the source domain, and as shown in Section 4.2 architecture, and are unchanged when the source and target domains are different. The few top layers learn more specialized features for each appliance and are fine-tuned to work with the target domain. In our method, the number of output appliances in the target model is adaptive because it is automatically set to the number of appliances to be disaggregated in the target data set. Overall, the steps of the proposed one-to-many transfer learning method are as follows, (1) obtain the pre-trained one-to-many model (Section 4.2); (2) create a base model, which has the same structure as the pre-trained model; (3) train the dense layers using the labeled target data set while not changing the CNN layers; (5) finally, in contrast to [28], we further improve the model via fine-tuning of hyper-parameters. 5 Experiments 5.1 Datasets We evaluate the proposed method using three open access data sets, widely used in NILM research, namely, REFIT, REDD, and UK-DALE, as well as our own recorded data that we refer to as SC-EDNRR. Table 1 shows the data sets used in this paper, the specific houses used, and the number of labeled appliances in each house. We always use the entire available dataset for each considered house. (1) REFIT. The cleaned REFIT dataset contains electrical measurements from 20 households in the Loughborough area of the UK from 2013 to 2014 [42]. Nine appliances are monitored in each house, and all data are recorded at 8-second intervals. Five types of appliances, namely kettle, microwave, fridge, dishwasher, and washing machine are the most commonly used baseline appliances in related NILM state-of-the-art literature. Since only two REFIT houses contain all five appliances, houses 11 and 20, are chosen for training and testing in this paper. We use data in the period from 30/Jul/2014 to 14/Aug/2014 to make up samples described in Table 2. (2) REDD. Reference Energy Disaggregation Data set (REDD) [43] comprises power usage data from 6 US households. Each house has two main meters and 10 to 25 individual appliance monitoring meters. The data is sampled once every 3 s. Houses 1 and 2 are chosen for training and testing since they contain all the five baseline appliances. We use data in the period from 11/May/2011 to 23/May/2011 to make up samples described in Table 2. (3) UK-DALE. The UK Domestic Appliance-Level Electricity (UK-DALE) [44] dataset contains readings from 5 UK houses. A main meter and several individual appliance meters are used in each house, and the electrical measurements are collected every 6 s. Houses 3 and 4 have relatively complete data and have been chosen as training and testing data. We use data in the period from 03/May/2013 to 13/May/2013 to make up samples described in Table 2. (4) SC-EDNRR. For a more thorough examination of the proposed network and to verify its applicability to another country and real-time performance, a set of smart meters were installed in a room of a non-residential facility. The data set is dubbed \u201cEnergy Disaggregation data set in a Non-Residential Room in Shanghai, China\u201d (SC-EDNRR), which consists of six appliances: freezer, fridge, washer, air conditioner, central air conditioner (CAC), and a computer server. As in REFIT and REDD datasets, to provide ground truth, each appliance is monitored by an individual appliance energy meter. The overall power usage is provided by a single main meter. The data set covers a four-month period from 22/Sep/2021 to 13/Jan/2022 and is sampled once per second. The smart meters and equipment in the room are depicted in Fig. 4. The dataset is available on https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/datasets/energy-disaggregation-data-set-in-a-non-residential-room-in-shang. Since the REFIT has 8-seconds intervals, all other data sets were resampled to 8 s as well. 5.2 Metrics To evaluate the performance, we use three metrics commonly used in recent NILM literature [28]: mean Normalized Disaggregation Error (NDE), normalized Signal Aggregate Error (SAE), and Energy per Day (EpD). NDE measures the normalized error of the squared difference, and is defined as: (5) N D E = ∑ i , t x i t − x ˆ i t 2 ∑ i , t x i t 2 , where i ∈ { 1 , \u2026 , N } denotes appliance number, N is the total number of all appliances, and t indicates the time step. x i t and x ˆ i t denote the real consumption and the estimated consumption of appliance i at time t , respectively. SAE is used to evaluate the difference between the total energy consumption and estimated energy consumption: (6) S A E = | r i − r ˆ i | r i , where r i = ∑ t x i t denotes the total energy consumption of appliance i for all time step t in the test period, while r i ˆ = ∑ t x ˆ i t represents the its estimated total energy consumption. EpD is a metric to measure daily prediction error: (7) E p D = 1 D ∑ d = 1 D | e i − e ˆ i | , where e i ˆ and e i represent the estimated and true energy consumption of appliance i in a day, respectively. The difference between e i and r i is that the former denotes the energy consumption of appliance i in the whole test period, while the latter represents the energy consumption of appliance i per day. D denotes the total number of days in the test data. In addition to these three measures, we introduce a new one, and we name it the Overall Disaggregation Proportion Error (ODPE). It reflects the long-term disaggregation error of each type of electrical appliance from the perspective of load ratio, taking into account the proportion of electricity consumed by each appliance: (8) O D P E = | r ˆ i − r i | ∑ i = 1 N r i ∗ 100 % , where ∑ i = 1 N r i is the total number of samples of the aggregate metered energy consumption in the testing period. ODEP focuses on the estimated error of the proportion of electricity consumed by each type of appliance relative to the total electricity consumed. 5.3 Settings for training neural networks A fixed-length window, which is set as 599, is used for the input data and is shown in Fig. 2. Furthermore, each window\u2019s data is created by sliding a window one time step [45], that is, each subsequent window is shifted from one sample to the next one. The procedure of a sliding window is depicted in Fig. 5, where L denotes the number of samples of the data set. Samples are chosen at random from all the samples listed in Table 2 to make up the training, validation and testing sets with a 60%\u201320%\u201320% ratio. The first four CNN layers are kept unchanged to enable transfer learning, and the last two dense layers are fine-tuned when applied to the target domain. There are five steps in the process of transfer learning. (1) Obtain the pre-trained model, and to be consistent with the state-of-the-art research, the REFIT data set was chosen as the source domain as per [28]. (2) Create the base model with the same first four CNN layers as the pre-trained model. The output number is set as the total number of appliances in each target house in the experiments. (3) Keep the CNN layers in the pre-trained model fixed, and add two trainable dense layers, and train them using target domain data (5) Fine-tune the first four layers at a very low learning rate, which is set to 1e−4 in our experiment. Four groups of experiments were conducted. In the first experiment (Case i), the performances of the traditional one-to-one model [28] and the one-to-many model proposed in this paper are compared based on the REFIT dataset. In the second and third experiments (Case ii and Case iii), the performances of the one-to-one transferred model [28] and the proposed one-to-many transferred model in this paper are compared. In these two sets of experiments, model was trained on the REFIT dataset and tested on REDD houses 2, 5 and UK-DALE houses 3, 4, respectively, to verify the generalization of the proposed model and compare it with the state-of-the-art method. In the fourth experiment iv (Case iv), the traditional one-to-one model [28] and the proposed one-to-many model are applied to our own recorded SC-EDNRR dataset to verify the accuracy of the proposed method. In all simulations we use the data described in Table 2 and network setting as shown in Table 3. 5.4 Results We compare our results with the results achieved by the state-of-the-art one-to-one seq2point transfer learning method of [28], which were taken from [28] for (Case i\u2013iii). Table 4 shows the results for estimating five appliances with the one-to-one model of [28] and the proposed one-to-many model on the REFIT dataset, which is the most challenging dataset of the three considered. It can be seen that a lower SAE for Microwave and Kettle are obtained by the one-to-one model, while lower SAE for Fridge, Washing machine, and Dishwasher is obtained using the one-to-many model. For EpD, it can be found that two appliances perform better when using the one-to-one transfer model, and three appliances perform better when using the one-to-many transfer strategy. In terms of NDE, three appliances have lower NDE when using the one-to-one transfer model, one appliances perform better when using the one-to-many transfer strategy, and one appliance, Dishwasher, has the same NDE when using the two models. While using the proposed one-to-many transfer strategy has a higher NDE, the average values of SAE and EpD are lower, demonstrating that although the variance of decomposition results using the proposed one-to-many transfer strategy is slightly larger than that of the one-to-one transfer model, the average results of the whole are better. Fig. 6 is an example of the disaggregation curve for the Fridge using the proposed one-to-many model. It can be verified from the figure that the estimated trace accurately follows the ground truth curve. The ODPE values are less than 2 for all appliances except for the washing machine, which means the disaggregation ratio error of all appliances is less than 2%. The results indicate that the one-to-many model is competitive and performs very well when trained and tested on the same dataset. Tables 5 and 6 show the results of domain transfer learning, where the models are pre-trained on the REFIT dataset, and tested on REDD and UK-DALE, respectively. For the REDD dataset, the SAE values of Fridge and Washing machine using the proposed one-to-many transfer model are lower than that of the one-to-one model, while the SAE values for two other appliances are higher. Similarly, two appliances and three appliances perform better in the metrics of EpD and NDE respectively using the proposed one-to-many transfer model. The ODPE values of all the appliances using the proposed model are lower than 7, indicating that the disaggregation percentage errors of all appliances are less than 7%. Fig. 10 shows the proportion of electricity consumed by each appliance (actual and estimated) in the REDD dataset. Figs. 7, 8, and 9 plot an example of the disaggregation curves for Microwave, WashingMachine, and Dishwasher in REDD dataset, respectively, using the proposed transferred one-to-many model. It can be seen from the figures that the disaggregation of each appliance estimates well the trend of the true electricity consumption. For the UK-DALE dataset, the SAE values for the Fridge, Dishwasher, and Washing machine using the proposed one-to-many transfer model are lower than that of the one-to-one model. Similarly, four appliances and three appliances, the majority of all devices, perform better on the EpD and NDE metrics respectively using the proposed one-to-many transfer model. The ODPE of all the appliances using the proposed model are all lower than 4, indicating at most 4% of disaggregation error. Fig. 11 shows the proportion of electricity consumed by each appliance in the UK-DALE dataset, actual and estimated, showing that the proposed method can accurately estimate appliance consumption providing competitive performance to the more complex state-of-the-art method of [28]. In summary, the results show that disaggregating all appliances at once using a simple transferring one-to-many NILM model improves effectiveness and practicality without sacrificing accuracy. The reason behind this is that we add fine-tune to the first four CNN layers that are used to learn low-level features, to overcome the difference between source and target domain data [46]. To verify the universality and practicality of the proposed method, we tested the model on the SC-ENDRR dataset, after pre-training the model on REFIT. Table 7 shows the results of the benchmark model and the proposed model in terms of various performance metrics including SAE, NDE, EpD and ODPE. It can be seen that the proposed one-to-many model performs better for most appliances. Indeed, the SAE, NDE, EpD, and ODPE values of Freezer, Fridge, Air. C (Air Conditioner) and Server are all lower with the proposed method. The explanation is that, the load characteristics and the electricity usage of this dataset are somewhat different from those of the training dataset. Therefore, it is not enough to train the dense layer only, it is more important to do the fine-tuning of the CNN layers, which is used for feature extraction, to further improve its performance. Fig. 12 depicts disaggregation pie charts for each of the six appliances. All the ODPE values are under 2, which means the disaggregation percentage error of all appliances is less than 2%. This chart shows that the model pre-trained by the public dataset can be used for a pre-training model for our specific use, providing a reasonable strategy for disaggregation. In general, the results suggest that the proposed transfer one-to-many model proposed in this paper is suitable for both public dataset and self-collected dataset, and has good practical value. Furthermore, the total number of learnable parameters for these networks are shown in Table 8. It can be seen the proposed method has much fewer parameters to learn, which means the proposed method is easier to implement in practice and requires fewer computational resources to train the models. 6 Conclusion In this paper, we propose a one-to-many model and a transfer one-to-many model for multi-target energy disaggregation to improve the effectiveness and practicality of NILM. The proposed transfer strategy for multi-targets NILM can achieve promising results using a single model and limited measurements, according to experimental results on four public datasets and our practical collected data, using four different metrics. The intuition behind the proposed method is that adding a fine-tuning process for the target source can help improve the model\u2019s performance. In future research, more attempts will be made to further reduce training data and avoid prior installation of sub-meters on electrical appliances.

Appendix A Supplemental description for CNN layers of the model in Fig. 2 As described in Section 4.1, the τ th input window can be represented as y τ . Four CNN layers are used in the proposed model. The output of the c th convolution layer, at time stamp t is: (9) y t c = ∑ ∀ k y t + k w c + b c , where k is the length of the receptive field, w c and b c , are the weights and bias, respectively, and y t c denotes the output of the layer. Note that dimensions of the vectors y t c , w c and b c would differ from layer to layer. After performing the convolution operations, the output is flattened, i.e., reshaped into a column vector, and then a dense layer is applied: (10) y t d = w d y t c + b d , where w d and b d represents the weight and bias in the dense layer, respectively. Finally, the output layer receives the input from the dense layer and outputs: (11) x ˆ t ( i ) = w o y t d + b o , where w o and b o represents the weight and bias, respectively. x ˆ t ( i ) is the output of the dense layer, and since this is a regression network, represents estimated electric consumption of appliance i . Note that all weights and bias vectors are parameters to be learned via backpropagation. To obtain these parameters, θ = [ w c , b c , w d , b d , w o , b o ] , a mean square error loss function is set as follows: (12) L ( x | f ( y , θ ) ) = 1 T 1 N ∑ τ = 1 T ∑ i = 1 N ( x t 0 ( i ) − f ( i ) ( y τ , θ ) ) 2 , where x t 0 ( i ) represents the true consumption of appliance i at time t 0 , f ( i ) ( y τ , θ ) the estimated consumption of appliance i at time t 0 , and t 0 the midpoint of each time window τ . Appendix B More detail for the metric of ODPE In the field of NILM, the aim is to disaggregate the electricity consumption of each appliance, thus, it is helpful to understand proportion of electricity consumed by each appliance, and the estimated error of proportion of electricity consumed by each type of appliance relative to the total electricity consumed. On this basis, we proposed the metric of Overall Disaggregation Proportion Error (ODPE), O D P E = | r ˆ i − r i | ∑ i = 1 N r i ∗ 100 % , (i.e., the Eq. (8) in Section 5.2). The SAE and ODPE have a similar form, however, they measure different aspects for energy estimation. The former measures the error of an appliance\u2019s consumption relative to its true value, while the latter measures the error relative to the sum true value of all the appliances. The latter calculates a percentage for each appliance, which can reflect the overall disaggregation proportion error. For example, suppose there are 4 appliances in a room, TV, lighting, fridge and washing machine (WM). If the aggregated energy consumption in a certain period (2 days, which will be used for the calculation of EpD) is 300 Wh, the real energy consumptions are 40 Wh, 50 Wh, 90 Wh and 120 Wh, for the four appliances, respectively. Noise is neglected in this toy example. Suppose the estimated energy consumptions of the four appliances are 32 Wh, 55 Wh, 109 Wh, and 130 Wh respectively (the summation of the estimated consumption may not be equal to 300 Wh). Thus, it can be calculated that the NDE of TV is N D E T V = 40 Wh − 32 Wh 2 ( 40 Wh ) 2 = 0 . 40 , the SAE of TV is S A E T V = | 40 Wh − 32 Wh | 40 Wh = 0 . 20 , and the EpD of TV is E p D T V = 1 2 | 40 Wh − 32 Wh | = 4 . 00 Wh . It can be seen that although the disaggregation results have been evaluated from several perspectives for the TV, it lacks a metric that measures percentage of electricity consumed by the TV relative to the whole. This may be useful in many scenarios, such as estimating energy bill for each appliance, or estimating the proportion of electrical appliances consumed over a longer period of time. ODPE is proposed to address this issue. The ODPE of TV is O D P E T V = | 40 Wh − 32 Wh | 300 Wh ∗ 100 % = 2 . 66 % . Appendix C Additional experiments To demonstrate cross-domain transfer learning, an additional experiment, where the model is trained on REDD data set and tested on both REDD and REFIT datasets, was conducted. The description of the data sets used in this experiment is shown in Table A.1. Table A.2 shows the disaggregation performance comparison using SAE, EpD (Wh), NDE, and ODPE evaluation metrics between the one-to-one model and the proposed one-to-many model. One can see that the one-to-one model performs only slightly better than the one-to-many model, while in Table A.3, the one-to-many transfer model performs better on the disaggregation of Fridge, Dishwasher, and Washing machine. The results show that the proposed transfer learning strategy with fine-tuning its feature extraction layers, i.e., the CNN layers, can perform as good as (and often better than) the one-to-one transfer model, which requires one model for each appliance and more parameters for each model, is hence computationally more intensive.

        "dc:description": "Buildings represent 39% of global greenhouse gas emissions, thus reducing carbon emissions in buildings is of importance to greenhouse gas emissions reductions. This requires understanding how electricity is utilized in the buildings, then optimizing electricity management to seek conservation of energy. Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) is a technique that disaggregates a house\u2019s total load to estimate each appliance\u2019s electric power usage. Several strategies for estimating one appliance at a time (one-to-one model) have been presented and experimentally proven to be effective, with two mainstream trends: appliance transfer learning and cross-domain transfer learning. The former refers to the transfer between different types of appliances in the same data domain, while the latter refers to the transfer between different data domains for the same type of appliance. Different from the previous work, this paper explores the approach of adopting one model for all appliances (one-to-many model) and proposes a novel transfer learning scheme, that incorporates appliance transfer learning and cross-domain transfer learning. Thus, a well-trained model can be transferred and utilized to effectively estimate the power consumption in another data set for all appliances, which demands fewer measurements and only one model. Three public data sets, REFIT, REDD, and UK-DALE, are used in our experiments. Further, a set of smart electricity meters was deployed in a practical non-residential building to validate the proposed method. The results demonstrate the accuracy and practicality compared to start-of-the-art one-to-one NILM transferred models.",
