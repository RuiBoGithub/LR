In the current landscape of sustainable energy, integrating photovoltaic (PV) generation and electric vehicles (EVs) into household energy management systems (EMSs) has become a pivotal strategy to enhance grid sustainability in residential areas and provide economic benefits to homeowners. This article introduces an innovative approach to an energy administration framework designed for intelligent households, to seamlessly integrate EVs, both with and without PV generation. The proposed plan meticulously optimizes residential electricity expenses. It standardizes the load gradient using Time-of-Use (TOU) cost, residential electricity use fluctuations, PV generation patterns, and specific variables of EVs, including entry and exit times and charging statuses. The management method is divided into two distinct phases based on charging constraints and initial charge status. Stage A comprises three operational states contingent upon the availability of PV generation, while Stage B involves five operational states predicted based on anticipated PV generation. Through this research, the advanced control strategy facilitates precise adjustment of energy absorption by EVs from the grid and/or PV generation, along with injected energy derived from EVs to the grid. It ensures minimal residential electricity expenses and synchronizes the electrical load profiles. The findings indicate a significant reduction in residential electricity expenses and a substantial normalization of power load characteristics. Furthermore, simulation results emphasize the superior performance of the proposed plan for intelligent households fitted with both EVs and PV generation, compared to households with EVs alone, in terms of lowering expenses and normalizing load scenarios.

This need is particularly relevant to the highest energy-consuming countries, including China, the United States, the Russian Federation, India, Japan, Canada, Germany, Brazil, South Korea, and France. From 1970 to 2012, these high-consumption countries accounted for the majority of global energy consumption, with their energy use rising from 2,847 Mtoe to 8,112 Mtoe, reflecting a 185 % increase or an average annual growth rate of 2.5 %. By 2012, these countries were responsible for 62 % of global energy consumption. Consequently, this study focuses on these major energy consumers to address and mitigate their significant energy-related challenges [1,2]. This has resulted in the emergence of technologies for renewable energy and EVs in the electrical and transportation sectors as promising solutions to address these pressing issues [3\u20135]. However, the inherent uncertainty of generation from renewable sources such as hydroelectricity and PV energy, along with the irregular charging schedules of EVs, poses significant challenges to the power grid, including increased peak loads, voltage fluctuations, fluctuating loads, and overproduction [6]. Efficient energy utilization amidst these challenges is crucial, particularly in coordinating EV charging schedules with renewable energy production. Residential energy management systems (EMSs) play a pivotal role in reducing electricity expenses, alleviating power grid stress, and meeting energy demands, thereby offering significant economic benefits to homeowners [7]. To effectively navigate these challenges and capitalize on opportunities, the integration of advanced control algorithms and real-time data analysis is essential for optimizing household energy use. Specifically, the integration of EVs into broader energy systems introduces both opportunities and challenges, particularly in the development of adaptive EMSs capable of synchronizing EV charging with renewable energy generation. This synchronization is critical as it enhances energy efficiency and grid stability, making it a central focus for modern energy management solutions [8]. Current research has increasingly focused on developing robust energy management approaches that facilitate the seamless integration of renewable energies and EVs into residential environments and the broader grid infrastructure. The advent of smart grids, coupled with two-way communication capabilities enabled by smart meters, offers homeowners numerous benefits, such as financial incentives and improved electricity efficiency practices [9]. Furthermore, within the context of smart grid and household network advancements, homeowners now have the ability to regulate their energy usage, storage, and generation via household energy management devices. Residential EMSs are designed to minimize electricity costs and mitigate grid stress while satisfying energy demands. These systems are vital for automating the scheduling of household appliances, EVs, and decentralized energy sources based on variable pricing structures. Active energy management not only provides substantial economic benefits for homeowners but also bolsters grid stability and sustainability [10]. The integration of renewable energies and EVs within residential settings necessitates the development of complex EMSs that manage the dynamic interactions between energy production, consumption, and storage. Advanced control algorithms and real-time data analysis within these EMSs are crucial for optimizing renewable energy utilization and EV charging patterns, thereby reducing grid stress and enhancing energy efficiency. While EVs offer the potential to act as mobile energy storage, capable of drawing energy during off-peak hours and feeding it back during peak periods, the unpredictable nature of EV charging underscores the need for adaptive EMSs. These systems must synchronize EV charging with renewable energy generation to optimize energy use and minimize grid stress effectively. In recent years, the integration of household EMSs with EVs has emerged as a significant area for researchers. In [11], four distinct energy management strategies for a grid-connected photovoltaic battery (PVB) system were evaluated across four different building communities: campus, residential, office, and commercial. The demand-side energy management scenarios examined include maximizing photovoltaic self-consumption, a cost-minimization approach using TOU pricing, and two peer-to-peer (P2P) strategies\u2014one based on Mid-Market Rate (MMR) and the other on a novel demand response (DR) mechanism. In [12], an innovative robust optimization model was presented, designed to use flexibility constraints to manage the ramp rate of power trading between Citizen Energy Communities (CECs) and the upstream grid. This study evaluated how these flexibility limits affect energy costs, prioritizing two key objectives for CECs: maintaining prosumer comfort, including thermal comfort, and achieving energy self-sufficiency. In [13], an optimization model for a two-stage energy management system aimed at reducing energy costs in residential buildings was introduced. The model operates under monthly power-based tariffs for peak demand and time-variable electricity prices. In the first stage, the expected peak demand is identified, followed by the second stage, where the energy management system focuses on minimizing energy costs. In [14], a two-stage strategy for residential communities during planned outages was presented, utilizing the coordination of household loads and EVs. In the first stage, after a planned outage notice, the community energy management system (CEMS) optimizes EV charging and discharging, reshaping the load curve to minimize unserved load during the outage. In the second stage, this optimized load curve is allocated to individual households using a power allocation model. Several studies focusing on cost reduction and network optimization have addressed various aspects of this integration. In [15] explored the integration of electric vehicles (EVs) in residential energy management systems. They propose a model that optimizes EV charging and discharging schedules to support household energy needs during grid outages. Their findings show that utilizing EVs as mobile energy storage can significantly enhance grid resilience. The study also highlights the importance of real-time data and adaptive algorithms for effective energy management. In [16] focused on the flexibility of household loads as a crucial element in energy management systems during grid outages. Their research emphasizes the role of smart appliances and home automation systems in dynamically adjusting energy consumption. The study proposes a two-stage management framework that prioritizes critical loads while optimizing the use of available resources, including EV batteries. Their results demonstrate improved energy efficiency and reliability in maintaining essential household functions during outages. In [17] investigated the impact of community-level energy management systems that leverage both EVs and household load flexibility. They present a decentralized approach where households coordinate with each other to share energy resources during grid disruptions. The study shows that this collaborative model can reduce the reliance on external energy sources and enhance the overall resilience of the community. The authors also discuss the challenges related to communication infrastructure and data privacy in such systems. In [18] research centered on the economic benefits of utilizing EVs for residential energy management during grid outages. They develop a cost-benefit analysis model that compares the expenses associated with traditional backup generators versus EV-based energy storage. The study finds that, over time, EVs can offer a more cost-effective and environmentally friendly solution. Additionally, the authors highlight potential savings on electricity bills through optimized energy use when the grid is operational. In [19] proposed a hybrid energy management strategy that combines renewable energy sources, EVs, and household load flexibility to enhance resilience during grid outages. Their model includes predictive algorithms that forecast energy demand and supply, allowing for proactive adjustments. The study demonstrates that integrating renewables with EVs not only supports energy needs during outages but also contributes to long-term sustainability goals. The authors conclude that such integrated systems are key to future-proofing residential energy management against increasing grid instability. Furthermore, many research efforts have focused on household energy administration interface systems with PV systems and EVs. For example, in the study [20], a household electricity management system based on the MILP planning model for an intelligent household includes small-scale distributed PVs, EVs, and an energy storage system with the main objective of minimizing total consumption costs. Daily electricity was optimized to achieve this goal. In [21], the challenge of climate change and the European Union's decarbonization goals were addressed by focusing on the electrification of building services through the adoption of renewable energy sources, replacing fossil fuels. A key strategy in this trend is the installation of grid-connected PV systems. However, the widespread use of PV technology raises concerns about grid security and stability, as excess intermittent renewable energy can potentially exceed voltage limits. Consequently, optimizing the self-consumption of a building's PV production to minimize excess output is crucial. In [22], a method for optimizing energy operations in buildings integrated with renewable energy sources, specifically PVs and ESSs, was outlined and empirically demonstrated. The proposed optimization approach starts by calculating a weather index (WI) derived from environmental and climatic data, focusing on its impact on photovoltaic energy production. In [23], an Internet of Things (IoT) task management framework designed to minimize energy consumption in smart residential buildings through predictive optimization was introduced. The proposed framework includes a predictive optimization module that forecasts energy usage patterns and an optimization module that addresses energy consumption reduction challenges. To assess the effectiveness of the predictive optimization approach, energy data is collected from various household appliances. In [24], an optimization algorithm for Model Predictive Control (MPC) of HVAC systems in multi-family residential buildings was introduced, evaluating performance across four distinct objective functions. In [25], the TID-SEM (Three-tier Integrated Demand and Supply Energy Management) framework was presented as a strategic approach for managing both demand and supply at the prosumer level. The framework begins with data collection and employs machine learning techniques, including a Random Forest classifier, to manage demand and reduce peak consumption. Household energy administration integration systems with PV technologies and EVs have been a focal point in recent studies, primarily emphasizing reducing energy costs. However, an important aspect that has been neglected in these studies is load curve softening. Existing literature has focused on decreasing energy consumption costs and smoothing the load gradient, including PV generation within the framework. Additionally, some studies have concentrated on smoothing the load curve with electric car charging to fully occupy low load periods and eliminate peak loads according to the daily household load profile, without considering time-varying electricity costs. This oversight can result in increased household energy expenses. Therefore, there is a need to develop a new smart energy administration method for households equipped with PV systems and EVs. The primary goal is to regulate the flow of energy to and from the electric car flexibly to minimize electricity costs and smooth the load curve. The proposed strategy aims to monitor the system through two stages, each with several modes, considering factors such as the daily PV power generation schedule, live pricing signals, daily electricity usage patterns for household devices, EV entry and departure times, and specified minimum and maximum boundaries for the EV battery's current charge level. This strategy is designed to apply to any house furnished with PVs and EVs, providing economic benefits to homeowners by charging EVs from the grid and generating PV power when electricity costs and consumption are low, and using PV generation to cover the load when demand exceeds supply, thus supporting the residential grid. Additionally, the structure integrates energy storage in EV batteries used during peak consumption. This article analyzes the importance of residential energy control systems, which play a significant role in reducing electricity expenses, increasing efficient energy use, and smoothing the load curve. The primary benefit of the suggested technique is the adaptable electricity transfer from the grid to the car and from the car to the house. The control of charging and discharging EVs and using EVs as energy storage allows for transferring off-peak electricity and photovoltaic generation to peak consumption hours through Vehicle-to-Home (V2H) technology. This modern technology helps reduce electricity costs and smooth out the load curve. 2 Problem mathematical formulation 2.1 The objective function In the first case, the grid provides electricity to meet the demand, and EVs are seen as electrical loads in the household, being charged from the grid in an unregulated manner. The overall daily electricity consumption costs for this case can be computed by: (1) C I Total = ∑ t = 1 24 C t × P L t + P GEV t In the second case, EVs act as energy storage, charging at low prices during off-peak periods and using V2H mode to supply load during peak periods, resulting in reduced total electricity costs. The daily objective function obtained from the suggested approach for energy management in an intelligent household outfitted with EVs and without a PV system in the SH is introduced according to equation (2): (2) C II Total = ∑ t = 1 24 C t × P L t + P GEV t - P EVL t In the third case, residential electricity is supplied from both the power grid and the PV system, along with EVs providing energy through V2H mode. EVs obtain electricity from the grid during off-peak periods at low prices and from PVs when PV power exceeds the electrical load to be covered. Additionally, EVs are discharged to supply the load during peak periods, helping to minimize the overall daily electricity consumption cost. The objective function derived from the suggested energy management approach in a household with advanced technology, incorporating both EVs and PV systems, is presented in equation (3). (3) C III Total = PV C - D a y t ∑ t = 1 24 C t × P L t + P GEV t - P EVL t - P PVL t - P PVEV t 2.2 System load We consider a typical house equipped with various essential appliances such as lamps, refrigerators, fans, air conditioners, televisions, culinary equipment, and washing machines used in everyday life. These devices contribute to the total household electricity consumption, thereby creating the daily load curve. As specified in equation (4), the total electricity demand of these household appliances during a typical day can be calculated by summing the power consumption of each device. Due to the challenges associated with achieving realistic load profiles for a year, designers often resort to using average daily load values for modeling purposes. (4) W All = ∑ t = 1 24 P L ( t ) Findings from the US Energy Information Administration show that domestic electricity usage is relatively low at night and increases significantly in the morning and evening. In the context of this study, EVs are considered a new addition to the household load. As a result, the average household electricity consumption can be determined using equation (5). Additionally, the necessary energy for an EV journey can be calculated using the formula [5]: (5) P Avg = W All + W EV 24 (6) W EV = D × η EV The normal residential load curve can be segmented into two separate parts: load greater than the mean load and load less than the mean load. To size the PV system effectively, we need to consider the total load above the mean load line and the system's ability to meet the household's base load during peak solar hours [7]. The following formulation addresses these considerations: Total Load Above Mean Load Line: First, calculate the total load above the mean load line: (7) L above = ∑ t = 1 24 max ( 0 , P L ( t ) - P Avg ) Where P L t is the power consumption at time t, and P Avg is the average power consumption. PV System Capacity Calculation: The PV system capacity P PV is determined based on the load above the mean load line, the peak solar hours I d , and the derating factor d. The capacity should be sufficient to cover the load above the mean load line but limited by the base load P B : (8) P PV = L above I d × d if L above I d × d ≤ P B P B if L above I d × d > P B PV Generation Contribution: The contribution of the PV system to the load L D is given by: (9) L D = min P PV × I d × d , L above This ensures that the PV system's output does not exceed the load above the mean load line, maximizing the utilization of PV generation during peak solar hours. Energy Balance with PV Generation: The energy balance in the household with PV generation can be expressed as: (10) P grid ( t ) = P L ( t ) - P PV ( t ) - P EV ( t ) where P grid ( t ) is the power drawn from the grid, P PV ( t ) is the power generated by the PV system, and P EV ( t ) is the power consumed or supplied by the EV at time t. This formulation ensures that the PV system is optimally sized to cover the load above the mean load line while considering the limitations imposed by the base load and peak solar hours. It helps effectively reduce the household's reliance on grid power and smooth the load curve. Additionally, this paper presents a method for integrating household energy systems with PV technologies and EVs to reduce costs and stabilize the grid. It addresses the often-overlooked issue of load curve smoothing, proposing a smart energy management system that optimizes energy use and supports grid stability. Using advanced algorithms and real-time data, the system manages energy production, consumption, and storage, utilizing EVs as mobile storage to balance grid load. The primary goal is to minimize the total electricity cost C over a given time horizon T: (11) min C = ∑ t = 1 T ( P grid ( t ) · π ( t ) ) where, P grid ( t ) is the power drawn from the grid at time t. π(t) is the time-varying electricity price at time t. The objective also includes smoothing the load curve by minimizing the difference between the power drawn from the grid and the average power demand P ¯ : (12) min ∑ t = 1 T ( P grid ( t ) - P ¯ ) 2 Ensuring that the energy supply meets the demand at all times: (13) P PV ( t ) + P grid ( t ) + P EV discharge ( t ) = P load ( t ) + P EV charge ( t ) + P ESS charge ( t ) - P ESS discharge ( t ) Where, P PV ( t ) is the power generated by the PV system at time t. P EV discharge ( t ) and P EV charge ( t ) are the discharging and charging power of EVs, respectively. P ESS charge ( t ) and P ESS discharge ( t ) are the charging and discharging power of the ESS, respectively. P load ( t ) is the household power demand at time t. Maintaining the SOC within acceptable limits: (14) SOC min ≤ SOC ESS ( t ) ≤ SOC max SOC min ≤ SOC EV ( t ) ≤ SOC max Limiting the rate at which power can change to avoid stressing the grid: (15) | P grid ( t ) - P grid ( t - 1 ) | ≤ R max where R max is the maximum allowable ramp rate. This method ensures efficient energy use, reduces electricity expenses, and supports grid stability by smoothing the load curve and integrating renewable energy sources and EVs into the residential energy system [7]. 2.3 EVS The SOC of the battery, expressed as a percentage, is determined using the ampere-hour integration method, also known as Coulomb counting [26]. SOC varies dynamically due to power input from the grid or PV system and power output to the load [27]. To prolong battery life, SOC is maintained within specified minimum and maximum limits [28]. This approach reduces extreme charging and discharging cycles, ensuring optimal performance and durability of EV batteries. To describe the behavior of the lithium-ion battery in the Chevrolet Spark EV, we use a dynamic model that incorporates parameters for charge, discharge, and efficiency. Let B(t) represent the battery's state at time t, including factors such as internal temperature, charge, and health. A general model for this could be: (16) B ( t ) = B 0 + ∫ 0 t η charge I charge ( τ ) - η discharge I discharge ( τ ) d τ where, B 0 is the initial state of the battery, η c h a r g e is the charging efficiency, η d i s c h a r g e is the discharging efficiency, I c h a r g e ( τ ) is the current supplied to the battery at time τ, I d i s c h a r g e ( τ ) is the current drawn from the battery at time τ. The SOC as a percentage at time t can be computed by integrating the net current over time and normalizing it concerning the battery capacity: (17) SOC ( t ) = S O C 0 + 1 C batt · ∫ t 0 t I charge ( τ ) - I discharge ( τ ) d τ × 100 % where, SO C 0 is the initial SOC as a percentage, C b a t t is the battery capacity in ampere-hours (Ah). The rate of change of SOC concerning time can be described by: (18) dSOC ( t ) dt = P in ( t ) - P out ( t ) C batt where, P in ( t ) is the power input to the battery at time t (positive during charging), P out ( t ) is the power output from the battery at time t (positive during discharging). If the SOC exceeds these limits, it is adjusted accordingly: (19) SO C adj ( t ) = SO C min if S O C ( t ) < S O C min SO C max if S O C ( t ) > S O C max SOC ( t ) otherwise These refined formulations provide a comprehensive approach to modeling battery behavior and managing the state of charge in electric vehicles, ensuring both accurate performance tracking and preservation of battery life. 2.4 PV system Solar PV cells play an important role in converting sunlight into electrical energy through the PV effect. This process involves generating current and voltage at the output of the PV panel, which can be achieved by connecting PV cells in series or parallel to achieve the desired values of current and voltage [29]. The relationship between the current and voltage of PV cells is mathematically described in detail in equation (20) [30]. Additionally, the size of PV systems, a critical aspect in their design and implementation, can be specified by equation (21) [31]. These equations provide fundamental insights into the electrical characteristics and measurement considerations of PV systems [5]. (20) I PV = I PC - V PV - I PV × R SE R SH - I S × e q × V PV + I PV × R SE n × k × T × N S - 1 (21) S PV = L d d × L d As specified in equation (22), the overall cost of PV systems includes both the initial investment and ongoing operation and maintenance costs [32]. To facilitate cost comparison, the concept of annualization converts the PV system's capital costs into equivalent annual costs, as discussed in equation (23). Subsequently, the total cost of the PV system is calculated annually using equation (24). This project aims to reduce the overall daily electricity costs for residential use over a 24-hour period or to minimize the overall daily electricity expenses. Consequently, the yearly expense of solar PV energy should be transformed into a daily expense to facilitate its integration alongside other routine expenses. Therefore, the total yearly expense of the PV system is transformed into a daily expense according to equation (25): (22) PV TC = PV Cap + PV OM (23) PV Cap - A n n = PV Cap × r × 1 + r N 1 + r N - 1 (24) PV TC - A n n = PV Cap - A n n + PV OM (25) PV C - D a y = R c × PV TC - A n n 365 2.5 Proposed energy management system The proposed Energy Management System (EMS) is designed to optimize electricity expenses and stabilize power load fluctuations in households that integrate PV systems and EVs. This section elaborates on the operation and benefits of the EMS, particularly in the context of its broader implications for built-environment optimization and public health. The EMS aims to facilitate multiple energy flows\u2014Grid-to-Vehicle (G2V), PV-to-Vehicle (PV2V), and Vehicle-to-Home (V2H)\u2014to minimize daily electricity costs and smooth the household load curve. By intelligently managing the charging and discharging of EVs and the utilization of PV-generated power, the system significantly reduces the reliance on grid electricity, particularly during peak demand periods. These measures are effective in reducing electricity costs, maintaining the load curve within an optimal range, and optimizing energy usage. − The objectives of the proposed strategy include: − Identifying periods of low and high electricity prices. − Identifying periods of high and low electricity consumption. − Minimizing electricity costs by charging EVs from the power grid during periods of low prices and consumption. − Controlling the battery charging status of EVs to prevent excessive charging and discharging. − Using excess PV generation to charge EVs and reducing peak load by discharging EVs to meet load demands during peak periods. To achieve these goals, the proposed strategy utilizes various inputs such as daily PV power generation profiles, TOU pricing signals, daily electricity usage patterns, average power usage, average price signals, EV entry and exit times, and EV battery charge status. The system also considers the maximum and minimum limits of battery charge levels. Subsequently, power is regulated in two phases to effectively realize these goals. The power curve of EVs shows how charging and discharging behavior is affected by load demand and electricity prices. The load curve is significantly flattened when the EMS is employed, especially in households with both EVs and PV equipment. Additionally, daily electricity costs are lower in households with PV systems compared to those with only EVs. In smart homes (SHs) equipped with both EVs and PV systems, as well as those without EVs, the proposed EMS reduces electricity costs and smooths power load characteristics, thereby enhancing energy efficiency and providing tangible economic benefits to household owners. From a public health management perspective, implementing such energy management strategies can significantly contribute to the development of novel built-environment optimization policies. These policies can enhance urban resilience and sustainability by promoting efficient energy use and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The broader applicability of these findings across different geographic regions should be explored to validate the scope and effectiveness of the study's conclusions. By fostering energy-efficient practices and reducing the environmental impact of energy consumption, such policies can contribute to improved public health outcomes, making the study's conclusions valuable for large-scale implementation. Stage A This stage focuses on optimizing the timing of EV charging from the grid, primarily during off-peak periods when electricity prices are lower. The EMS ensures that EVs are charged at the most cost-effective times and that their discharge can be used to meet household demand during peak periods, thus reducing overall electricity costs and flattening the load curve [5]: 1) Mode 1. In this mode of operation, EVs remain inactive in terms of charging or discharging. In this case, there are four sub-states: (I) there is no EV at household, (II) the EV is at household, and The electric consumption is below the typical load, the cost of electricity is lower than the mean cost, and the battery charge status of the EV has reached its maximum capacity, (iii) EV is at household and electric load consumption is below the usual load and price of electricity is higher than or equal to mean cost, and (iv) EV is at household and electric load demand is equal to or more than the mean load and EV's battery level has reached its minimum capacity. As a result, as described in relation (26), the electric load demand remains constant. (26) P L - N e w ( t ) = P L ( t ) 2) Mode 2. According to equation (27), in this case, when an EV is present in the home, electric load demand is lower than the mean load, cost of energy is lower than the mean cost, and the vehicle battery's state of charge is lower than its maximum capacity. instance, in order to maximize energy use, the EV is charged from the grid. Equation (28) is used to modify the electrical load requirement curve as a consequence. (27) P GEV t = P Avg - P L ( t ) (28) P L - N e w t = P L t + P GEV t 3) Mode 3. In this mode of operation, the electric load consumption of the EV at home is greater than or equal to the mean load, and the battery state of the EV exceeds the minimum state of charge. To lower the peak load demand, the EV is discharged, as illustrated in equation (29). Consequently, the power load demand curve is determined using equation (30). (29) P EVL t = P L t - P Avg (30) P L - N e w t = P L t - P EVL t Stage B This stage further optimizes energy usage by prioritizing the use of PV-generated power to meet household demand and charge EVs. During this phase, excess PV generation is stored in EV batteries, which can later be discharged during periods of high electricity demand, thus reducing the dependency on grid electricity. These five modes are described below: 4) Mode 4. In this operating mode, the EV remains inactive in terms of charging or discharging, while PV energy is used to meet the load demand. In this case, there are five sub-states: I. There is no EV in the household. II. The EV is at the household, the electric load demand is lower than the mean load, the electricity price is lower than the mean cost, and the battery charge status of the EV has reached its maximum capacity. III. The EV is at the household, the electric load demand is less than the mean load, and the price of electricity is greater than or equal to the average price. IV. The EV is at the household, the electric load demand is equal to or more than the mean load, the PV power is greater than the electric load demand minus the mean load, and the battery charge status of the EV has reached its maximum capacity. V. The EV is at the household, the electric load demand is equal to or more than the mean load, the PV power is equal to or less than the electric load demand minus the mean load, and the EV battery's state of charge has reached its lowest point. Consequently, following equation (31), PV power is employed to satisfy the load demand, and equation (32) modifies the electric load demand curve. (31) P PVL t = P PV t (32) P L - N e w t = P L t - P PVL t 5) Mode 5. In this scenario, as mentioned in (33), when the EV is at home and the electricity demand is less than the mean load, the price of electricity is greater than or equal to the mean cost, and the battery charge level of the EV is lower than its maximum, the EV is charged only from the PV system due to the high cost of electricity. According to equation (33), the power load requirement remains constant. This mode enables optimizing the utilization of the PV system to charge the EV during periods of high electricity prices, helping to save money and optimize energy control in the smart home (SH). (33) P PVEV t = P PV t 6) Mode 6. In this operating mode, when the EV is in the household, the electric load demand is lower than the mean load, the electricity cost is lower than the mean cost, and the battery charge status of the EV is lower than its maximum. As a result, the EV is off the grid and should be charged from the PV system to optimize energy use. This process includes utilizing off-peak hours and transferring PV power to peak hours. Settings related to electricity use, electrical distribution from PV2V, and power flow from the G2V are described by Eqs. (34)\u2013(36), respectively. (34) P L - N e w t = P L t + P GEV t (35) P PVEV t = P PV t (36) P GEV t = P Avg - P L t - P PVEV t 7) Mode 7. In this instance, the EV is operating in the household, the PV power exceeds the electric load demand minus the mean load, the electric load demand is larger than or equal to the mean load, and the EV's battery charge is below its maximum capacity. The PV system provides for the needs of both the EV and the load. Eqs. (37)\u2013(39) illustrate the power flow from the PV system to the load, the power flow from the PV system to the vehicle, and the regulated electric load, respectively. (37) P PVL t = P L t - P Avg (38) P PVEV t = P PV t - P PVL t (39) P L - N e w t = P L t - P PVL t 8) Mode 8. Here, an EV is used to meet load demand when its battery charge is greater than its minimum capacity, the electric load demand is greater than or equal to the mean load, the PV power is less than or equal to the electric load demand minus the mean load, and the EV is operating at home. The electric current from the PV system to the load, the electric current from the vehicle to the load, and the regulated electric load are respectively shown using Eqs. (40)\u2013(42). (40) P PVL t = P PV t (41) P PVEV t = P L t - P Avg - P PVL t (42) P L - N e w t = P L t - 2 × P EVL t − Public Health and Built-Environment Implications The implementation of the EMS in smart homes (SHs) equipped with both EVs and PV systems not only provides economic benefits to household owners but also has significant public health and environmental implications. By reducing reliance on grid electricity\u2014often generated from fossil fuels\u2014the EMS contributes to lower greenhouse gas emissions and improved air quality. This reduction in emissions aligns with public health goals by decreasing the prevalence of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases linked to air pollution. Furthermore, the EMS's ability to smooth the household load curve and stabilize energy consumption supports the development of resilient and sustainable urban environments. These features are crucial for the adoption of novel built-environment optimization policies, which aim to enhance urban resilience and promote sustainable living practices across various geographic and climatic regions. − Broader Applicability Across Geographic Regions. The adaptability of the proposed EMS to different geographic and climatic conditions ensures its broad applicability. In regions with abundant solar resources, the integration of PV systems with EMS and EVs can be particularly effective in reducing electricity costs and minimizing grid dependence. Conversely, in areas with limited solar availability, the EMS still provides significant benefits by optimizing the timing of energy usage and charging EVs during off-peak hours. These characteristics make the EMS a versatile solution for enhancing energy efficiency and supporting sustainable urban planning efforts across diverse environments. By fostering energy-efficient practices and reducing the environmental impact of energy consumption, the EMS contributes to the development of built-environment optimization policies that are essential for achieving long-term sustainability and improving public health outcomes. 3 Simulation results A schematic design of the SH is shown in Fig. 1 and comprises several key elements, including EVs, home appliances, PV systems, daily load curves, daily solar radiation curves, daily pricing signals, smart meters, and energy system controls. The concept of an SH in this context refers to a household that can facilitate two-way communication of electrical energy flow, which aligns with the principles of the smart electricity system paradigm. The integration of these constituents into the SH framework enables effective management and regulation of power distribution among the power grid, PV system, household appliances, and EVs. This comprehensive approach to energy management and use is crucial in ensuring optimal energy efficiency, affordability, and environmental sustainability in residential environments. Validation of the efficiency and efficiency of the planned plan in terms cost reduction and stabilisation of load demand curve was done through simulation. The computing horizon of this study was determined to be 24 h. In this study, the computational horizon is set to 24 h. Solar data, sourced from [33], includes solar irradiation and temperature records from 1981 to the accessed date of August 1, 2020. For simplicity, we utilized solar data from the past five years to evaluate average output profiles, as illustrated in Fig. 2 . Fig. 3 shows the real-time pricing signals determined by the TOU rate of Southern California Edison [34]. This figure displays the electricity cost curve with distinct periods ranging from 13 cents/kWh to 39 cents/kWh, with a mean cost of 23 cents/kWh. This mean cost is determined by calculating the average electricity price per hour for the present investigation by dividing the daily price by 24 h. This pricing structure encourages homeowners to charge their EVs during off-peak periods (when electricity prices are lower) and discharge EV batteries to meet peak demand, thereby reaping economic advantages. The parameter configurations of EVs are detailed in Table 1 . It has been found that the optimal charging electricity level for automobiles at home is 1.5 kW to 3 kW [35]. Additionally, the daily distance traveled by EVs is considered to be equal to the average daily driving distance in the United States, which is 40 miles according to the US Department of Transportation [36]. Additionally, it is assumed that EVs leave the house for the first time at 08:00, return at 12:00, leave for the second time at 14:00, and return home at 17:00. During the first quarter of 2020, the total capital expenditure for residential PV systems in the US was estimated to be $2.83/W [37]. The residential solar investment tax credit accounts for 28 % of the total capital expenditure for projects initiated in 2020 [37], while O&M costs and interest rates are discussed in reference [38]. In the following analysis, we provide an overview of the operating modes and EMSs employed in SHs equipped with PV systems and EVs. The proposed strategy is designed to optimize energy consumption and ensure the efficient operation of the SH under different conditions. Fig. 4 shows eight distinct operating modes that arise when implementing the proposed strategy for managing power in an SH that incorporates both PV technologies and EVs. Modes 1\u20133 correspond to situations where PV power is not available, leading to the activation of step A in the EMS. Conversely, modes 4\u20138 represent scenarios where PV power is available, leading to the activation of step B in the EMS. As shown in Fig. 4(a), the noteworthy point is that the system operates in time intervals from 00:00 to 06:00 and from 18:00 to 23:00 in phase A, while the system operates in phase B between 06:00 and 18:00. Moving to Fig. 4(b), we observe different states that emerge when the suggested energy management plan is applied to an SH equipped with EVs but lacking PV capabilities. In this scenario, the system works exclusively in modes 1, 2, and 3 during the day, which represents the exclusive use of stage A in the EMS. Additionally, Fig. 5 shows the EV battery charge status curves when the suggested energy management plan is implemented in SHs with and without PV systems, respectively. These figures confirm that the battery undergoes charge and discharge cycles during this operation while maintaining its level of charge within the designated upper and lower thresholds. Fig. 6 (a) provides insight into the power curve of EVs when the proposed EMS is used in an SH equipped with both EVs and a PV system. Negative power values shown during certain periods indicate that EVs are charging from the grid, while positive power values indicate that EVs are discharging to supply the load. Additionally, the periods during which EVs remain outside the household are identified, during which neither charging nor discharging occurs. Within the realm of energy management in SHs, the use of EVs without PV systems presents unique challenges and opportunities. Fig. 6(b) provides a detailed picture of the power curve of EVs when the suggested energy management approach is implemented in an SH equipped with EVs but without a PV system. In this figure, negative power values during certain periods indicate that EVs draw electricity from the grid for charging purposes, while positive power values indicate that EVs are discharging to supply the load. Additionally, the periods during which EVs remain outside the household are identified, during which neither charging nor discharging occurs. Notably, the lack of change in the power curve of EVs in certain time intervals reflects the special conditions related to load demand and electricity prices, which affect the charging and discharging behavior of EVs. By examining Fig. 7 , we can see the load curve without EMS, the load curve with EMS and EVs, and the load curve with EMS, EVs, and PV systems, as well as the mean load curve. By comparing these curves, it is clear that the load curve is significantly flattened in cases where the energy management system is used, especially in the presence of both EV and PV equipment. Additionally, the use of the proposed EMS leads to a smoother load curve in an SH equipped with both EVs and PV systems, compared to when this strategy is applied in an SH with only electric energy. The economic consequences of these EMSs are shown in Table 2 , which displays the household's daily electricity cost in the aforementioned three cases. It can be seen that the daily electricity cost is reduced in Case B and Case C compared to Case A. Additionally, the daily electricity cost in Case C, where photovoltaic systems are used, is lower than in Case B, highlighting the potential cost savings of integrating photovoltaic systems in smart homes with electric vehicles. The comparison of daily electricity costs across different cases reveals the significant impact of energy management strategies on household expenses. Case C, which presumably integrates both PV systems and advanced energy management techniques, achieves the lowest daily cost of $26.31, representing a 16.6 % reduction compared to the baseline Case A, which has the highest cost of $31.48. This substantial decrease highlights the effectiveness of incorporating renewable energy sources and optimizing energy usage. Case B, with a daily cost of $27.93, also shows an improvement over Case A, indicating some benefits from its energy management strategy, though it is less cost-effective than Case C by 11.3 %. These findings underscore that while any form of energy optimization leads to cost savings, more comprehensive strategies involving both EVs and PV systems can deliver greater reductions in daily electricity expenses, thus enhancing overall economic efficiency. 4 Discussion The analysis of the proposed energy management strategy reveals its effectiveness in optimizing energy use and reducing costs in smart homes equipped with PV systems and EVs. When the system operates with PV power available, it effectively reduces the household\u2019s electricity costs and smooths the power load curve, demonstrating significant improvements over scenarios without PV integration. The strategy operates in two distinct stages: Stage A, when PV power is unavailable, and Stage B, when PV power is available. During periods when PV power is present, the system operates more efficiently, contributing to lower daily costs and a more stabilized power load profile. In contrast, when only EVs are present without PV systems, the energy management strategy primarily functions in Stage A, leading to higher daily costs and a less optimized load curve. This highlights the added benefits of integrating PV systems into the energy management strategy. The presence of PV systems not only reduces the overall cost but also enhances the smoothing of the power load curve compared to scenarios where only EVs are managed. The SOC curves for EV batteries in both scenarios indicate that the proposed strategy maintains SOC within operational limits, ensuring efficient charging and discharging. The power profiles further illustrate that the strategy adapts to varying conditions, such as whether the EV is charging from the grid, from PV, or discharging to meet load demands. This flexibility and adaptability underscore the strategy's effectiveness in managing energy efficiently across different conditions. The comparative analysis with existing strategies in the literature reveals that the proposed approach offers a more comprehensive solution by addressing both cost reduction and load curve optimization, aspects that were not fully covered by previous models. This makes the proposed strategy a significant advancement in the field, offering improved economic and operational benefits for smart home energy management. The discussion of Cases A, B, and C further clarifies the impact of different energy management strategies. Case A, serving as the baseline, shows higher costs and less optimized load management, reflecting a traditional approach without advanced optimization. Case B, which includes some form of energy management but lacks PV integration, demonstrates intermediate performance with moderate cost reductions and load smoothing. Case C, which integrates both EVs and PV systems, achieves the lowest costs and most efficient load management, underscoring the benefits of a comprehensive energy management strategy. Overall, the detailed examination of these stages and modes, along with the expanded analysis of each case, provides a clear understanding of how the proposed system enhances energy efficiency and cost-effectiveness. This comprehensive analysis underscores the system's capability to adapt to varying conditions and optimize energy use, offering significant improvements over traditional and partial optimization approaches. 5 Conclusion In our research, we have developed an innovative EMS for SHs that seamlessly integrates EVs and PV systems. The primary objective of this strategy is to minimize residential electricity expenses and smooth out the load curve. To achieve this goal, we have devised eight distinct states in the EMS, categorized into two stages. Stage A includes three states based on the absence of PV generation, i.e., when the PV power is zero, and Stage B comprises five states contingent upon the availability of PV power, i.e., when the PV power exceeds zero. The inputs to this strategy include parameters of EVs, TOU cost, time-varying household electricity demand, and PV generation profiles, all utilized to ensure cost minimization and variance reduction in the power load curve during system power supply. Our simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed EMS when applied to SHs equipped with both EVs and PV systems, as well as those without EVs. Specifically, we observed the flattening of the power load curve compared to scenarios where the proposed strategy was not employed. Furthermore, we conducted a daily electricity cost analysis for SHs equipped with EVs and PV systems under the proposed strategy, as well as for SHs with uncontrolled EV charging and no PV generation. Our findings reveal significant economic benefits for homeowners utilizing the proposed strategy, reducing daily electricity expenses from $32.69/day to $28.05/day for SHs equipped with EVs without PV, and to $27.48/day for SHs equipped with both EVs and PV. Consequently, our study illustrates that the proposed EMS for SHs with integrated EVs and PV systems outperforms in terms of reducing electricity costs and smoothing out power load characteristics when compared to SHs with EVs alone but without PV. These findings highlight the potential of integrating EVs and PV systems in smart homes, which not only enhance energy efficiency but also bring tangible economic benefits to homeowners. 6 Human participants and/or animals Not applicable.

        "dc:description": "In the current landscape of sustainable energy, integrating photovoltaic (PV) generation and electric vehicles (EVs) into household energy management systems (EMSs) has become a pivotal strategy to enhance grid sustainability in residential areas and provide economic benefits to homeowners. This article introduces an innovative approach to an energy administration framework designed for intelligent households, to seamlessly integrate EVs, both with and without PV generation. The proposed plan meticulously optimizes residential electricity expenses. It standardizes the load gradient using Time-of-Use (TOU) cost, residential electricity use fluctuations, PV generation patterns, and specific variables of EVs, including entry and exit times and charging statuses. The management method is divided into two distinct phases based on charging constraints and initial charge status. Stage A comprises three operational states contingent upon the availability of PV generation, while Stage B involves five operational states predicted based on anticipated PV generation. Through this research, the advanced control strategy facilitates precise adjustment of energy absorption by EVs from the grid and/or PV generation, along with injected energy derived from EVs to the grid. It ensures minimal residential electricity expenses and synchronizes the electrical load profiles. The findings indicate a significant reduction in residential electricity expenses and a substantial normalization of power load characteristics. Furthermore, simulation results emphasize the superior performance of the proposed plan for intelligent households fitted with both EVs and PV generation, compared to households with EVs alone, in terms of lowering expenses and normalizing load scenarios.",
