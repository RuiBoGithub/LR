Demand-side flexibility (DSF) has been touted as a possible solution to the challenges in power system operation arising from increasing intermittent renewables penetration and the emergence of electric vehicles. In Singapore, where around 24 to 60% of electricity demand in buildings could be attributed to heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) purposes, air-conditioned buildings represent a significant flexibility resource which could be used to provide DSF and help tackle these challenges. This study aims to investigate the DSF potential of Singapore\u2019s building stock and to explore how this potential could be realized through demand-side bidding. To this end, a building energy modeling tool with explicit modeling of the relationship between occupant comfort and HVAC load with model predictive control, CoBMo, is used. CoBMo allows optimal load scheduling to be expressed as a linear programming problem: minimizing overall electricity cost while maintaining occupant comfort. A price-based market clearing model is developed to evaluate demand-side bidding implementation, for which a case study on Singapore\u2019s Downtown Core district is developed. Three scenarios with possible future utility-scale photovoltaic (PV) penetration in Singapore\u2019s electricity system are explored, alongside a sensitivity analysis and a comparison between centralized dispatch and demand-side bidding with price-quantity pairs and linear curves. Results of the analysis show that DSF potential varies between building types, depending on cooling load and occupancy schedule. When extreme price fluctuations happen in future Singapore electricity market with 10 GWp PV penetration, demand-side bidding could aid consumers to utilize their DSF potential by encouraging more effective energy use and in turn, reducing their total electricity cost.

In contrast with the traditional concept of electricity flowing in one way from large generators to consumers in the grid, the advent of distributed energy resources (DERs) has caused bi-directional power flows to emerge in modern grids, particularly at the distribution level. Rooftop photovoltaic (PV) installations are a commonplace nowadays, with consumers producing at least part of the electricity they consume and therefore giving rise to the term prosumer. This has caused a paradigm shift in how the electricity grid should be operated, given the increasingly complex nature of the system. For example, electricity produced by wind and solar energy is inherently volatile in nature, which complicates the supply and demand balancing process. Furthermore, injection of electricity by prosumers at the distribution grid level might induce voltage issues if left uncontrolled. One concept which has been touted as a possible solution to alleviate these problems is demand side flexibility (DSF) which is one of the mechanisms of Demand Side Management (DSM). DSF strategies provide electricity producers, consumers, and system operators altogether the opportunity to benefit from flexibility in the energy consumption. For producers, DSF provides an opportunity to reduce the degree of curtailment in intermittent renewable generation by shifting flexible loads to periods with high renewable production. Meanwhile, consumers are compensated for their flexibility through two measures: price-based and incentive-based mechanisms [1,2]. Price-based mechanism relies on time-dependent price signals to encourage consumers to shift their energy consumption behaviors. On the other hand, incentive-based mechanism relates to the provision of monetary incentives by external parties (e.g. utilities or electricity retailers) in exchange for consumer load reductions. Direct load control (DLC) is an example of incentive-based DSF implementation, which involves consumers ceding control of their appliances to a third party so that they could be disconnected during critical periods [1]. At the same time, distribution system operators (DSOs) could also benefit from DSF by avoiding large supply/demand peaks which might induce instabilities in the power system. Despite all this, efforts are still needed to quantify the true potential of DSF and how it could be harnessed. One of the enablers of DSF has been the advent of smart grid. There is no universally accepted definition of the term \u201dsmart grid\u201d, although it is commonly agreed that the general purpose of a smart grid is to improve the efficiency, reliability, quality, and safety of the power system operation. In [3], the authors presented a comparison of the features of the smart grid and those of the existing grid, as well as the basic ingredients of the smart grid, of which communication and data management hold a crucial role. The benefits, risks, and challenges involved in smart grid and its importance for the generation of sustainable and reliable energy are discussed in [4]. In tropical countries such as Singapore, air-conditioned buildings present an interesting opportunity for demand side flexibility. Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems represent a significant fraction of electricity consumption in buildings. According to a survey conducted by Singapore\u2019s National Environment Agency (NEA) in 2017, 24% of an average household\u2019s electricity consumption could be attributed to air-conditioning [5]. When it comes to non-residential buildings, this figure climbs up to 60% according to a study conducted by Happle, et al. in 2017 [6]. In [7], the authors found substantial evidence that overcooling in tropical buildings is prevalent and it is suggested that this is due to non-optimal design and operation of the HVAC system. This shows that there is definitely a potential in applying DSF strategies in air-conditioned buildings to better plan their electricity consumption and reduce the strain on the electricity grid without sacrificing the occupants\u2019 thermal comfort at the same time. Research on the use of HVAC systems in buildings to provide DSF has gained a lot of attention in recent years. In [8], a novel air-conditioning system equipped with a chilled water tank and a temperature and humidity dependent control which allows buildings to participate in demand-side bidding and offer demand as frequency controlled reserve (DFR) was proposed. Results of the study show that the total energy cost of the building can be lowered by 29.7%. Similarly, the implementation of DLC in centralized air-conditioning systems of commercial buildings was explored in [9]. Their proposed strategy was demonstrated to reduce peak demand by about 23% while maintaining the building temperature within the acceptable limits. Meanwhile, in [10] the authors modeled the dynamic behavior of a large population of air-conditioning loads and developed a control strategy to enable them to provide demand response services. Singapore has taken steps towards a liberalized electricity market, with the first step being the introduction of a wholesale electricity trading market in 1998. Competition at the retail level was introduced in stages and was eventually fully established with the rollout of the Open Electricity Market (OEM) in 2018. As of 1 May 2019, the government has completed the nationwide rollout of OEM, which means that all electricity consumers in Singapore are now contestable, i.e. all consumers have the liberty of choosing their own electricity retailers. However, they are not obliged to do so and could instead continue buying electricity at the regulated fixed tariff from the state-owned electricity distribution company SP Group [11]. The fixed tariff is regulated by the Energy Market Authority (EMA) and is reviewed in each quarter, with the price as of March 2020 being 25.94 cents/kWh [12]. According to EMA, 40% of the households have decided to select their own retailer as of 31 August 2019 and have enjoyed savings of 20 to 30% compared to the regulated tariff [11]. Singapore\u2019s wholesale market is a power pool consisting of half-hourly auction periods for energy, regulation, and reserve. For each of these periods, generators submit their supply offers and transactions are settled by the Market Clearing Engine (MCE) based on the overall least-cost dispatch schedule subject to forecasted demand and system and security constraints, resulting in the market clearing price (MCP) and the capacities allocated to the generators [13]. In 2016, EMA introduced a demand response (DR) program with the objectives of enhancing competition in the wholesale market and improving overall system efficiency, which could in turn result in downward pressure on electricity prices. A contestable consumer who could offer a load reduction of at least 0.1 MW is eligible to participate in the DR program, either directly as a licensed load provider or through electricity retailers or licensed load providers. Consumers bid for curtailments in a similar way as to how generators bid for supplies in the electricity market, i.e. bids are submitted as price-quantity pairs. Incentives to participate in the program are calculated as one-third of the additional consumer surplus generated from the load reductions and are paid out to consumers who are selected to be curtailed during certain market clearing periods [14]. As DSF is considered as a key component of future power systems operation, studies on the integration of DSF into electricity markets are becoming increasingly important. In [15], the authors analyzed the potential of DSF strategies for residential consumers and the obtained results indicate that DSF shows potential for load balancing as well as financial savings. An investigation of the current DSF program as implemented in Singapore\u2019s wholesale electricity market was conducted in [16]. They argued that in its current form, the DSF program limits the amount of flexibility that consumers could offer and as such, the full benefits of DSF might not be realized. In [17], several alternative strategies to the current implementation of the DSF program: time of use pricing (ToU), real-time pricing (RTP), and DLC were explored. Potential consumer benefits stemming from these strategies were presented, although they gave no recommendation as to which should be preferred. Considering the current restricted form of Singapore\u2019s DSF program, it would be interesting to further investigate the other extreme, i.e. full demand-side bidding with all consumers being exposed to wholesale prices. Demand-side bidding is not a new concept, as it is already a feature of the wholesale electricity market of a number of countries such as Australia, Canada, and most of the European countries [18]. In these markets, customers are typically represented by their retailers and it is the latter who organize and submit demand bids in the wholesale market. To maximize their profits, retailers generally attempt to procure electricity in the most economic way subject to their expectations of the market prices. This is analogous to the self-scheduling problem of electricity generators in competitive markets, which was reviewed thoroughly in [19]. The authors classified optimal bidding strategy formulation models for generators into three categories: single generation company (GenCo) optimization, game theory, and agent-based models. In the literature, there are plenty of studies which explore optimal demand-side bidding strategy formulation. In [20] a stochastic linear programming model to formulate the optimal bidding strategy for a price-taking retailer in Nord Pool, the Nordic power exchange, was developed, with the objective of minimizing the expected cost of purchasing electricity from the day-ahead and real-time balancing markets. The model proposed in [21] shares the same objective for a retailer in the Spanish electricity market, although genetic algorithm was employed to determine the best purchasing strategy. Meanwhile, the authors of [22] proposed a scenario-based optimal bidding strategy model based on linear programming for a retailer considering DR. In this case, the retailer aims to minimize the electricity procurement cost while also considering the provision of DR service. Based on the identified need of integrating DSF into electricity markets operation, this paper aims to investigate how air-conditioning loads in buildings could provide DSF through demand-side bidding in the context of Singapore. A case study based on Singapore\u2019s Downtown Core district is developed to demonstrate how Singapore\u2019s buildings could participate in the electricity market through demand-side bidding and to what extent they could influence the market prices. As per the authors\u2019 knowledge, there are several studies which look into the utilization of DSF in Singapore\u2019s electricity market [16,17,23], but all of them were focused on the currently implemented DR program. Thereby, the main contribution of this paper lies in the implementation of demand-side bidding in Singapore\u2019s electricity market to utilize the DSF potential of buildings. To this end, consumer\u2019s electricity cost in the market will be the subject of analysis and the results should give an indication to policymakers as to whether demand-side bidding could facilitate the integration of DSF. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the methodology used to derive the results and analysis of this paper. The first three Sections 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 cover the Downtown Core test case development, while 2.4 and 2.5 describe the methods used for DSF potential quantification and demand-side bidding implementation, respectively. Section 3 contains a detailed description of the test case. The results are presented in Section 4 and the conclusions are presented in Section 5. 2 Methodology Fig. 1 illustrates the overall workflow and each item is described in detail in the upcoming sections. The first three sections of the methodology cover the test case development, which is subsequently used in the analysis of two main topics: load shifting potential quantification and demand-side bidding implementation. 2.1 Building data acquisition As the first step, the geometries of all buildings in Singapore were sought. These were obtained from OpenStreetMap, whose data is available under the Open Database License, with the help of the Overpass API [24]. The Python script containing the query sent to the API could be found in the author\u2019s GitHub repository [25] and the output is a geospatial data stored in GeoJSON format. The buildings are represented by polygons in latitude and longitude axes in accordance with the EPSG:4326 coordinate reference system (CRS). 2.2 Building use classification To classify the buildings based on their main usage, a number of additional datasets were acquired. A summary of these datasets is presented in Table 1. As per URA\u2019s definition, the Master Plan (MP) is \u201dthe statutory land use plan which guides Singapore\u2019s development in the medium term over the next 10 to 15 years\u201d. As such, the MP contains permissible land use for every land parcel in Singapore, which should help in identifying the usage of the buildings depending on their location. The latest version of the MP is the MP 2019, which had not been made available as of March 2020. Therefore, the next most recent MP was used in this paper, which is the MP 2014. It is provided in shapefile format (SHP), which could be read in Python through the use of the GeoPandas package [29]. By default, the MP data is based on the EPSG:3414 CRS which makes use of x and y axes instead of latitude and longitude, thereby it has to be projected into the EPSG:4326 CRS first before it could be used. This projection is carried out with GeoPandas\u2019 internal functions. Similar to the building data, the land parcels are represented by polygons in latitude and longitude axes, with a single use associated with each parcel. As for the remaining datasets, additional data processing is necessary. The second dataset contains information regarding all the commercial buildings in Singapore, while the third addresses government-owned public housing. They are provided as CSV files and by default, they do not contain any geospatial information. Therefore, the first step is to find the coordinates (i.e. latitude and longitude) of each building in these two datasets. This was done with the help of the OneMap API, Singapore\u2019s national map which is developed and maintained by the Singapore Land Authority [30]. Each building\u2019s address forms the main part of each query sent to the API and the latter sends the latitude and longitude values corresponding to the address in return. Subsequently, each building in these additional datasets could be matched with the ones in the initial building data. Fig. 2 illustrates the process of joining all datasets, depicted in database-style tables. Each dataset has a geometry column/feature, which is used as the key in the joining process. For the Master Plan, each building in the building data should be contained inside one land parcel in the Master Plan, implying that spatial join should be conducted to identify which buildings are inside each land parcel and their main use should correspond to the category identified by the MP. Similarly, spatial join is also conducted for the commercial building data and HDB data. Since these two datasets have coordinate values (i.e. latitude and longitude) in their geometry feature, they are represented as points instead of polygons. These points are matched with the building data to see if they are contained within the latter\u2019s geometry and the uses are extracted. Additional features, namely building floor area and number of levels are also obtained for later use. The building use as dictated by the MP might not agree with the one prescribed by the commercial building and HDB data. In this case, the latter is prioritized since it comes in finer resolution and should theoretically be more precise. Lastly, the building uses are narrowed down to ten categories as follows: 1. Single residential 2. Multi-residential 3. University 4. School 5. Retail 6. Office 7. Hotel 8. Hospital 9. Industrial 10. Other 2.3 Building parameter sets derivation In this section, the steps taken to derive representative parameter sets for building energy modeling simulation in CoBMo are described. Details on CoBMo are provided in Section 2.4.1. 2.3.1 Approximation of building shapes and sizes For the sake of simplification, in this paper all buildings are assumed to be homogeneous shape-wise, with the floor plan being cuboid as depicted in Fig. 3. The four sides of a certain cuboid represent the walls of the corresponding building i and are denoted by s 1 i and s 2 i , expressed in meter. For every building, these parameters could be calculated as a function of the building\u2019s floor area A i in m 2 and perimeter P i in m according to (1) s 1 i ⋅ s 2 i = A i (2) 2 ( s 1 i + s 2 i ) = P i The above equations represent a system of two linear equations with two unknowns, solving which gives exact solutions. The motivation behind this approach is that by maintaining the buildings\u2019 floor area and perimeter, the floor area to perimeter ratio ( A i ∕ P i ) of each building is kept constant, hence enabling more accurate approximation of the buildings\u2019 heat transfer characteristics. It is further assumed that s 1 i > s 2 i and walls which measure s 1 i are oriented towards north and south, while walls measuring s 2 i face east and west as indicated in the figure. The height of a particular building h i is calculated based on the l e v e l s or f l o o r a r e a information obtained in the Section 2.2, which describe either the number of floors present in the building ( N F i ) or its gross floor area ( G F A i ) in m 2 . In the latter case, the number of floors present is calculated according to (3) N F i = R o u n d ( G F A i A i ) Finally, h i is obtained by simply multiplying the number of floors with the typical floor height, taken to be 3.6 m [31]: (4) h i = 3 . 6 ⋅ N F i 2.3.2 Occupancy and appliances schedules To calculate the electricity consumption of a building, estimations have to be made to predict the building\u2019s occupancy level and the number of appliances being used. For this purpose, CoBMo makes use of separate occupancy and appliances schedules and they are expressed in fractions varying between 0 and 1, i.e. 0 corresponds to zero occupancy and 1 corresponds to full occupancy. The schedules for the various building use categories used in this paper are derived from City Energy Analyst (CEA), an open-source tool for urban energy systems modeling [32]. Building use schedule obviously differs on weekdays compared to weekend and this is reflected on the schedules. The full schedules for office buildings are presented in Figs. 4 and 5, while the schedules for other building categories could be found in Appendix. 2.3.3 Indoor comfort constraints In this paper, the parameters considered for indoor comfort are indoor temperature and fresh air flow rate (FAFR). For indoor temperature, a temperature range is required, i.e. minimum and maximum temperatures while for FAFR only a minimum is required. The values used, along with their sources, are listed in Table 2. They are obtained from Singapore Standards Council (SSC) and Deutsches Institut für Normung (DIN) standards for indoor air quality and thermal environment as well as Green Mark requirements, Singapore\u2019s building assessment method. Since these limits are imposed to ensure occupant comfort, they are closely related to the occupancy schedules presented in Section 2.3.2. Here, it is assumed that the limits are only enforced when the occupancy rate is greater than or equal to 0.3, so as to simulate the fixed-schedule operation of HVAC systems commonly found in existing buildings [33]. Conversely, when the occupancy rate is below the minimum threshold, temperatures are allowed to vary between 20 and 35 °C and no minimum fresh air flow rate is enforced. 2.3.4 Internal gain factors Internal gain represents the heat emitted within an internal space by people, lights, electronic equipment, etc. As such, internal gain affects a building\u2019s heating or cooling load. Internal gain factors in the buildings are typically expressed as a function of the gross floor area, i.e. in W/m2. The values used in this paper are also obtained from CEA. In line with the categorization presented in occupancy and appliances schedules, separate values for the occupancy and appliances internal gain factors are derived. Table 3 presents a summary of the obtained values. 2.3.5 Construction material properties Defining representative construction material properties for buildings in Singapore is necessary to ensure that the heat transfer behavior of buildings is properly approximated. For simplicity, it is assumed that all buildings belonging to the same use category are constructed with the same material. Further simplification was made to classify buildings into two categories: residential and non-residential; the former comprises single and multi-residential buildings and the latter covers the rest. This was done to allow the derivation of construction material properties from Green Mark standards, from which most of the necessary properties were obtained. For properties which are not covered by Green Mark standards, additional data was sought from CEA. Tables 4 and 5 summarize the construction material properties derived from both sources for the two building categories. 2.4 Load shifting potential quantification To quantify the load shifting potential of the various building types, benchmark buildings were defined for every building type. They are assumed to be of the same size, their gross floor area being 10,000 m2 and spread over 20 floors. The floor plan area is set to be 500 m2, with s 1 and s 2 fixed at 25 and 20 m, respectively and the height of the buildings h considered as 72 m. While these specifications make sense for some of the building types (multi-residential, university, retail, office, hotel), they might be considered as being too large for the other types (single residential, hospital, school, industrial). Therefore, the results obtained should be interpreted as the upper limit of the buildings\u2019 load shifting potential. In practice, these buildings are represented in CoBMo and their load shifting potential is estimated by solving an optimization problem. This is described in the upcoming sections. 2.4.1 Building energy modeling with CoBMo Building models in CoBMo are represented as vectors in state space form which contain the differential equations for the zone temperature and surfaces in the buildings, namely: (5) x = [ T z ] T , [ T s ] T T (6) u = [ [ Q ̇ z g e n , h e a t ] , [ Q ̇ z g e n , c o o l ] , [ V ̇ z a h u , h e a t ] , [ V ̇ z a h u , c o o l ] , [ V ̇ z t u , h e a t ] , [ V ̇ z t u , c o o l ] ] T (7) v = T a m b , T s k y , [ q ̇ s i r r ] T , [ q ̇ z o c c ] T T (8) y = [ T z ] T , [ V ̇ z a h u ] T , P h v a c , e l T where the vectors x,u,v, and y are the state, control, disturbance, and output vectors. By applying zero-order hold discretization to these vectors, the thermal building model could be transformed to its time-discrete form, given by: (9) x t + 1 = Ax t + B u u t + B v v t (10) y t = Cx t + D u u t + D v v t A,C are the state and output matrices, while B u , D u and B v , D v are the input and feed-through matrices on the control and disturbance vectors, respectively. More detailed information as to how this state space model is formulated could be found in [37,38]. In the simplest case, CoBMo could be used to determine the optimal electricity consumption schedule of a building given its state space model by formulating it as an optimization problem as follows: (11) min ∑ t ∈ T P t h v a c , e l c t Δ t s.t. (9), (10) ∀ t ∈ T T z , t m i n ≤ T z , t ≤ T z , t m a x ∀ z ∈ Z , t ∈ T V ̇ z , t m i n ≤ V ̇ z , t a h u ∀ z ∈ Z , t ∈ T , where T is the set of time steps in the planning horizon and Z is the set of all zones in the building. The objective function of the above problem is to minimize the total electricity cost consumed for HVAC purposes over the planning horizon T , with P t h v a c , e l and c t being the power consumed by HVAC equipment and electricity price at time step t expressed in MW and S$/MWh , respectively. Δ t denotes the length of the time steps, expressed in hours (h). The first constraint refers to the state space model of the building as described, while the last two constraints are indoor comfort constraints, namely temperature and minimum fresh air flow limits. At each time step, the temperature at every zone in the building T z , t should always fall between the lower ( T z , t m i n ) and upper limits ( T z , t m a x ) and the fresh air flow supplied by the air handling unit to every zone V ̇ z , t a h u should be over the minimum required ( V ̇ z , t m i n ). The parameters of the state space model and comfort limits are defined as described in 2.3. By varying the electricity prices c t , the optimal consumption level according to the corresponding price level P t h v a c , e l ( c t ) could be determined, which represent the implicit demand side flexibility potential of buildings. 2.4.2 Calculation of load shifting potential Load shifting potential irrefutably varies with time, e.g. a building should offer less flexibility when it is fully occupied as opposed to when it is empty. To calculate the load shifting potential of the benchmark buildings at every half-hour interval over the course of a given day, the following setup is proposed: 1. Starting with the first half-hour interval ( t = 1 ), the prices at all the other intervals are set to be an arbitrary value x (12) c t ≠ 1 = x , while at the interval being analyzed the price is set to be the product of x and a factor of 1 + α (13) c t = 1 = x ( 1 + α ) 2. The cost minimization problem is run with this configuration, resulting in the optimal consumption level for the corresponding time interval if the price were to increase by a factor of α , P t h v a c , e l ( c t = 1 = x ( 1 + α ) ) 3. The optimization problem is re-run, but with the price at the interval being analyzed set to be (14) c t = 1 = x ( 1 − α ) , representing the case if the price were to decrease by a factor of α . Accordingly, the result is the optimal consumption level at a lower price level, P t h v a c , e l ( c t = 1 = x ( 1 − α ) ) 4. The process moves on to the next half-hour interval and the whole process is repeated until all intervals are exhausted 5. The load shifting potential at each interval is then calculated as (15) L S P t = P t h v a c , e l ( c t = x ( 1 − α ) ) − P t h v a c , e l ( c t = x ( 1 + α ) ) , illustrating how much the optimal load could change if electricity prices vary by ± α . The price variation factor α could be interpreted as a price sensitivity factor, since the optimal consumption level changes with α . Here, it is assumed that α is equal to 0.5. 2.5 Bidding strategy formulation Demand bids have two main components: price and power, the latter indicating the amount of electricity consumers would like to consume at the corresponding price level. To obtain these two components, building energy modeling and electricity price forecasting are used in this paper. Building energy modeling is used to explicitly model the relationship between a building\u2019s load and its indoor conditions, while the forecast of electricity prices allows consumers to schedule their electricity consumption to minimize their total costs. By putting together these two components, consumers could determine the amount of electricity they would like to consume at any given period to both satisfy indoor comfort and keep their electricity bills low, subject to their expectations of the electricity prices. Since indoor comfort parameters as described in Section 2.3.3 take a range of values instead of exact numbers, there is some flexibility with regard to electricity consumption in buildings, which could be considered as DSF. Similar to the previous section, CoBMo is used to define building models and generate the bids that buildings should submit to the wholesale market. The approach taken in this paper is a conservative one, as it is assumed that consumers are always able to keep their indoor comfort regardless of the outcome of the wholesale market. 2.5.1 Electricity price forecasting To forecast prices in Singapore\u2019s wholesale electricity market, a time series analysis tool is employed. The long and short term movements of electricity prices could be approximated by a deterministic and stochastic approach, respectively. Using a deterministic approach, the long term trend of electricity price movements is modeled and removed from the initial time series, which results in the deseasonalized time series comprising stochastic residuals. It is then fed to the stochastic part of the model, which estimates the short term fluctuations of electricity prices as a stochastic process. In this paper, as an input data to the model, Singapore\u2019s wholesale electricity price time series data from 2010 to 2019 was obtained from the Energy Market Company [39]. The deterministic components of the model consist of the long-term trend, weekly, and daily cycle while the stochastic part is modeled with ARIMA. The whole process is depicted in Fig. 6 and each step is described accordingly. Log operation. In the first step, the log operation is used to transform the historical electricity price. In [40], it was found that electricity prices are best represented by the empirical lognormal distribution, as it captures the left-skewness of the price data. On top of that, assuming that prices are normally distributed would mean that prices are expected to be negative around half of the time, which is not true in Singapore\u2019s case. The transformation operation is given by (16) Y t = log c t , where c t is the USEP price at time t in S$/MWh and Y t is the resulting log transformed price. Long-term trend removal. As the first step, the long-term trend in the data is removed via linear regression. A linear regression model is built to estimate the annual averages of the price logs and these estimates are subsequently subtracted from the time series. The model is as follows: (17) Y t L T = α L T + β L T ⋅ y t , where α L T and β L T are the intercept and the gradient of the model, respectively. The predictor of the model y t is the year the data point at time t belongs to. Weekly cycle removal. After the long-term trend is removed from the price logs, weekly fluctuations in the data are modeled and eliminated. This is done through the use of an absolute sinusoidal function since the movement of electricity prices throughout the week generally resembles a sinusoidal wave as found in [41]. This function is given by (18) Y t W C = α W C + β W C ∣ sin ( π t 336 − Φ W C ) ∣ , where α W C and β W C are the intercept and the gradient of the model, while Φ W C is the phase shift parameter, determined as the deviation from the time point where the weekly cycle records its minimum value in the time series. The sole predictor t denotes the time step, i.e. the overall position of the data point in the time series. Daily cycle removal. The last step in the deseasonalizing process is to subtract the remaining daily cycle in the data. For each day of the week, i.e. Monday to Sunday, a daily average is calculated and removed from each point in the time series, depending on the day of the week that the data point belongs to. (19) Y t D C = Y t , d ̄ ∀ d ∈ 0 , 1 , 2 , \u2026 , 6 , where d denotes the day of the week (0 for Sunday, 1 for Monday, \u2026, 6 for Saturday) and Y t , d represents the daily average of log transformed price Y t for day d . ARMA model. ARMA stands for Auto-Regressive (AR) Moving Average (MA) and is a class of modeling tools used to predict future values of a given time series, considering its past values. An ARMA model is usually defined as an ARIMA(p,q) model, where: \u2022 p is the number of AR terms \u2022 q is the number of MA terms Most statistical forecasting models, including ARMA, assume that the time series subject to analysis is stationary, i.e. its statistical properties such as mean, variance, and autocorrelation are constant over time. Since the input to the ARMA model comprises stochastic residuals as a result of a series of deseasonalization steps, it is assumed to be stationary. In this paper, an ARMA(1,1) model is constructed. The model could be expressed as follows: (20) Y t S = ϕ 1 Y t − 1 S + θ 1 ϵ t − 1 + ϵ t , with the predictors Y t − 1 S and ϵ t − 1 being the previous observation and its error at t − 1 , respectively. ϕ 1 and θ 1 are the coefficients of these predictors, while the last term ϵ t represents the white noise in the time series, which is assumed to be normally distributed around zero. Since ARMA is a short-term forecasting model, the model is used to forecast the range of possible values that the prices could fall within during the next 48 half-hourly time steps, representing an entire day which is considered as the planning horizon in this paper. Fig. 7 presents the expected prices according to the forecast model alongside their lower and upper limits. The intervals between these limits are used to generate price points for demand bids. Four price points are generated for each time step by dividing the interval in question into three smaller intervals of equal size. The resulting price points are shown in the same figure, denoted by red markers. The forecasted range of values could be updated on a rolling basis once new information regarding market clearing price is obtained, e.g. after the clearing price at the first time step is known, the forecast model is updated with this new value and a new set of predicted values is generated for time steps 2 to 48. This setup could be used to demonstrate the accuracy of the forecast model when comparing forecasted to actual values of the market clearing prices. By fitting the model in this way, the actual market clearing prices are passed one by one to the forecast model and the actual price at a particular time step is used only to generate the price interval at the next time step. For example, actual price at time step 1 is passed to the model to update the forecast for time step 2, accordingly actual price at time step 2 is used to update the forecast for time step 3, and so on. The result is shown in Fig. 8. As the figure shows, the model has a reasonable accuracy in this setup, judging by the relatively small distances between the predicted and actual values throughout all the time steps. Therefore, this setup is used while generating demand bids to estimate upcoming market prices, which is described in Section 2.5.2. 2.5.2 Bidding strategy formulation procedure In this paper, it is assumed that all the consumers are exposed to wholesale electricity prices. To this end, all consumers are required to submit their demand bids in the form of price-quantity pairs to the market operator to indicate the amount of electricity they would be willing to consume at any given price, which directly reflects the extent to which demand-side flexibility is available. In formulating their bids, consumers should devise a plan to ensure that occupant comfort is maintained while minimizing their electricity costs. The strategy proposed here utilizes the forecasted price points obtained from the procedure explained in Section 2.5.1 to help consumers achieve their objectives, i.e. minimizing cost while maintaining comfort. The bidding strategy formulation procedure is as follows: 1. For the first time step, the corresponding predicted price points are obtained as shown in Fig. 7, e.g. 46.5, 55.6, 65.4, and 74.8 S$/MWh for time step 1. 2. Optimal scheduling of electricity consumption is run using CoBMo with the price at the next time step set to one of the price points, while for the remaining time steps the expected prices are used. (21) c t = n = Y t , j , j ∈ J (22) c t ≠ n = E ( Y t ) This is repeated until all price scenarios, denoted by the set J , are exhausted. The output of this simulation is the optimal consumption levels at varying prices, i.e. price-quantity pairs. 3. The bids are then submitted to the market clearing engine, which calculates the market clearing price and in turn, the dispatch quantities of the buildings. The buildings are assumed to be restricted to consume the exact amount of electricity that is dispatched for them. 4. The forecast model is updated with the new market clearing price, resulting in new expected prices for the remaining time steps whose clearing prices are not yet determined. 5. The whole process moves on to the next time step and is repeated until all the time steps in the desired planning horizon are cleared. The optimal scheduling problem in CoBMo is formulated as a linear programming model, with the objective of minimizing the expected electricity cost during the upcoming bidding periods. For every building, the state space model and indoor comfort constraints of the CoBMo building models are implemented in accordance with the explanation given in Eq. (11). For the periods that are already cleared, an additional constraint is imposed to ensure that buildings comply with their respective dispatch quantities. The complete formulation is given below. (23) min ∑ t ⊆ T , t ≥ n P t h v a c , e l c t Δ t s.t. (9), (10) ∀ t ∈ T T z , t m i n ≤ T z , t ≤ T z , t m a x ∀ z ∈ Z , t ∈ T V ̇ z , t m i n ≤ V ̇ z , t a h u ∀ z ∈ Z , t ∈ T P t h v a c , e l ≤ Q t + ϵ ∀ t ⊆ T , t < n The problem is almost identical to the CoBMo self-scheduling problem presented in Section 2.4.1, with the exception of the planning horizon being shortened to include only the upcoming time steps as dictated by the objective function and the addition of the last constraint. The constraint is added to set the electricity consumption at the previous time steps P t h v a c , e l , t < n to be equal to the dispatch quantities Q t . A small tolerance factor ϵ , set to 1, is added to avoid rounding problems when solving the optimization problem. 3 Test case A test case based on a district in Singapore, Downtown Core, was built to evaluate the impact of demand-side bidding in Singapore\u2019s electricity market. Fig. 9 presents an overview of the buildings overlaid on top of the district map, while the distribution of the building types is given in Fig. 10. There are 649 buildings in the district in total, with the majority of them being retail or office buildings with few multi-residential, school, and hospital buildings in the district. As such, it is expected that the overall DSF potential of the district should largely be dictated by the characteristics of retail and office buildings. 3.1 Market clearing simulation Market clearing simulation is meant to replicate the formation of prices in a wholesale electricity market. In this paper, it is assumed that double-sided auction is implemented in Singapore\u2019s wholesale market. Demand bids are obtained according to the procedure described in Section 2.5.2. To derive supply bids, however, is difficult, given that bid information in the electricity market is always confidential to prevent market participants from gaining an unfair advantage over the competition. For simplicity, it is assumed that the supply curve is a linear curve which describes the relationship between the power offered and its corresponding price and the same curve is used for all bidding periods, i.e. the supply curve is assumed to be constant across bidding periods or time steps. It is also assumed that there is always enough generation capacity to meet the demand and no transmission constraints are considered when clearing the market. The supply curve is obtained by fitting a linear regression model to Singapore\u2019s wholesale electricity market data in 2019, with the log of the USEP being the dependent variable and the demand of the system being the independent variable as given by the following equation: (24) log c t = a ⋅ D t + b D t = log c t − b a with c t and D t being the USEP in S$/MWh and the corresponding system-wide demand in MW, respectively. a and b describe the gradient and the intercept of the linear regression model, which are determined through least squares regression to be 0.000211 and 3.258. The resulting model is presented in Fig. 11, which shows that the relationship between log price and demand could only be described as partially linear. This is certainly less than ideal, but given that the supply curve only serves to approximate the behavior of price formation in the wholesale electricity market, it is assumed to be such in this paper. The derived supply curve is only applicable when we have information on the system-wide demand D t . Since the test case only focuses on consumers in Downtown Core, a residual system demand profile has to be derived, representing the total system demand outside Downtown Core and is considered to be constant with no possibility of deviating from the base profile. For this purpose, actual wholesale prices on 1 January 2020 were obtained from the EMC. Plugging the prices into Eq. (24) allows us to obtain an estimation of the system-wide demand at each time step. The result still has to be subtracted by the demand in Downtown Core ( D t , D T ) to result in the residual demand ( D t , r e s ). The aggregate demand in Downtown Core is estimated with CoBMo by setting the price c t at a fixed value, which is constant across the time steps. This reflects a flat-price scenario where consumers aim to minimize their total electricity consumption. (25) D t , r e s = D t − D t , D T The actual clearing prices and the derived residual demand are summarized in Table 6. 3.2 Test case scenarios In the market clearing simulation, three scenarios are considered as follows: \u2022 Baseline (Scenario 1): the supply curve as presented in Fig. 11 is used as-is. \u2022 10 GWp PV penetration (Scenario 2): this scenario assumes 10 GWp PV installed in Singapore, which could theoretically cover around 25% of the country\u2019s electricity demand assuming a capacity factor of 15%. \u2022 10 GWp PV penetration with artificial fluctuations (Scenario 3): similar to the previous scenario, with the addition of artificial disturbances to create price spikes: from 10:00 to 17:30 PV production is reduced to zero every two time steps, e.g. between 10:00 to 10:30 the amount of PV produced electricity is adjusted to zero, but between 10:30 to 11:00 the production is unchanged, before dropping down to zero again in the next time step. The pattern repeats for the upcoming hours during the specified interval. The motivation behind this scenario is to simulate the extreme case where prices in the wholesale market fluctuate significantly, which might be due to extreme weather conditions, disturbance in the transmission system, suppliers bidding strategically, etc. In electricity markets, price uncertainty is typically high, hence the results of this scenario would test the robustness of demand-side bidding as DSF enabler. This scenario would also serve to replicate the occurrence of very low electricity prices, as is the case in electricity markets with high intermittent renewables penetration [42]. For scenarios with PV, it is assumed that all PV produced electricity can readily be absorbed by the demand, meaning that it directly reduces the system-wide demand whenever it is produced. This will in turn reduce the market clearing prices, as it is analogous to shifting the supply curve to the right and moving the intercept between the supply and demand curves to a lower price point. The PV production profile used in this paper is generated from renewables.ninja [43] for the year of 2019. The parameters used for the simulation are summarized in Table 7. The output from the simulation is the PV production profile for 365 days with an hourly resolution, which is then averaged to yield the production profile of a typical day. Lastly, it is resampled into a half-hourly resolution and linear interpolation is used to fill out the missing observations. The final PV generation profile which is used in Scenario 2 is shown in Fig. 12, while Fig. 13 presents a modified version of it, used in Scenario 3. For all the scenarios, an analysis is then carried out to determine the implications of demand-side bidding from consumers\u2019 perspective. Consumers\u2019 electricity costs are compared between the consumers with flat-price scheduling and with demand-side bidding. Moreover, further analysis on Scenario 3 is conducted as described below. 3.2.1 Sensitivity analysis Sensitivity analysis is conducted to investigate the robustness of the bidding strategy and is conducted for two variables: lower temperature limit and frequency of price spikes. The former is used to explore the potential benefits consumers would gain if they were willing to decrease the minimum tolerable temperature during occupancy, while the latter aims to look at what would happen if price spikes were to occur in a less frequent manner. It should be noted that while it is also possible to carry out a sensitivity analysis on the upper temperature limit or maximum temperature allowed in the buildings, this was not conducted due to the complexity in isolating the effects of increased flexibility from the benefits brought about by lower energy usage. The cases considered in the sensitivity analysis are as follows: \u2022 Lower temperature limit: 22 (Case T1), 21 (Case T2), 20 (Case T3) °C, representing a 1, 2, and 3 °C decrease in the lower temperature limit compared to the baseline (23 °C) \u2022 Frequency of price spikes: the disturbances as seen in Scenario 3 are altered to occur every 3 (Case P1) or 4 (Case P2) time steps. The resulting PV production profiles are given in Figs. 14 and 15. 3.2.2 Centralised dispatch comparison To evaluate the effectiveness of demand-side bidding, a comparison against centralized dispatch is conducted. In the case of centralized dispatch, it is assumed that there is an entity with the perfect knowledge of all building models, residual demand profile, PV production profile, and supply curve as such that they are able to minimize the total electricity cost of all the buildings. This is expressed as the following optimization problem: (26) min ∑ i ∈ I ∑ t ∈ T P i , t h v a c , e l c t Δ t s.t. (9), (10) ∀ i ∈ I , t ∈ T T i , z , t m i n ≤ T i , z , t ≤ T i , z , t m a x ∀ i ∈ I , z ∈ Z , t ∈ T V ̇ i , z , t m i n ≤ V ̇ i , z , t a h u ∀ i ∈ I , z ∈ Z , t ∈ T , where I is the set of all buildings in the district. The above problem represents a social welfare maximization problem in the electricity market, with the objective of minimizing the consumers\u2019 total electricity cost. Since c t is an exponential function of the demand as given in Eq. (24), the function is approximated with a linear regression model so as to make the optimization problem solvable. The linear approximation of the supply curve is as follows: (27) c t = 14 . 198 + 0 . 0138 ⋅ D t 3.2.3 Linear bid curves comparison In Singapore\u2019s case, bids in the wholesale electricity market are treated as price-quantity pairs or block bids. For demand bids, a price-quantity pair bid of a given consumer denotes the amount of additional electricity the consumer is willing to consume if the market clearing price is less than or equal to the stated price. For example, if a consumer submits two price-quantity pairs at a given bidding period: 100 MW at 100 $/MWh and 150 MW at 50 $/MWh, the consumer will consume 100 MW if the clearing price is between 50 and 100 $/MWh, and 250 MW if the clearing price is below 50 $/MWh. As an alternative to the block bids structure, bids could also be submitted as linear curves, which is actually more commonly encountered. Taking the above example, the same consumer would bid two points to represent their bid curve: 100 MW at 100 $/MWh and 250 MW at 50 $/MWh. When the clearing price is below 50 $/MWh, the outcome for the consumer will stay the same between the market structures, but when the price is between 50 and 100 $/MWh the amount of electricity the consumer is dispatched will be a linear interpolation between the two points in their bid curve. For instance, if the clearing price is 75 $/MWh, 175 MW will be dispatched to the consumer. As seen in the above examples, the linear curves setup seems to be more flexible, which might aid consumers in planning their optimal schedules. As the last subject of analysis of this paper, a comparison between block bids and linear curves setups is explored. 4 Results and discussion 4.1 Load shifting potential Results of the load shifting potential quantification for all the building types are summarized in Fig. 16. It could be seen that the two building types with the highest amount of load shifting potential per area are single and multi-residential buildings. For these two building types, the peak of the load shifting potential is encountered between 09:30 (time step 20) and 16:00 (time step 33). The following time steps, i.e. time steps 21 and 34 mark the start and the end of the low occupancy period as dictated by the parameter sets derived in this paper. During the low occupancy period, building temperatures are allowed to vary between 20 and 35 °C, hence the potential for pre-cooling is greater during this period. In the few time steps leading up to 09:30 and the time steps that come after 16:00, the load shifting potential of these buildings is lesser than the peak potential, but greater than the potential observed outside this period, i.e. between 00:00 and 07:00. A possible explanation for this behavior is that during the latter period, the cooling load of the buildings is lower due to fewer appliances being used as the inhabitants are supposed to be asleep. This in turn limits the amount of pre-cooling which could be conducted, leading to lower variability in electricity consumption. Nevertheless, during this high occupancy period, the load shifting potential is significantly lower compared to the low occupancy period as a result of tighter temperature limits being imposed. Hotel buildings exhibit the same behavior as single and multi-residential buildings, with the exception of its peak load shifting period ending earlier due to the earlier start of the high occupancy period (15:30). In the morning, industrial, office, school, university, retail, and other buildings show a notable increase in their load shifting potential prior to the beginning of their high occupancy period. For industrial, office, school, and university buildings, high occupancy period starts at time step 19 (09:00) while for retail and other buildings this occurs at time step 23 (11:00). In the former case, time step 17 (08:00) is where the peak load shifting potential is encountered, since it represents the last opportunity to conduct a significant amount of pre-cooling by making use of the wide temperature range allowed in the low occupancy period. For retail and other buildings, however, the peak load shifting period lasts for 3 time steps or 1.5 h and is preceded by a time step with somewhat lower potential. This could be explained by the higher cooling load encountered during this period due to increasing solar gain. During the high occupancy period that follows, lower load shifting potential for these building types is observed, in line with the behavior encountered with the other three building types described previously. When the high occupancy period ends, however, two different behaviors are observed: industrial and school buildings demonstrate a rebound in their load shifting potential for several time steps, while other building types see their potential fall back to zero. An explanation for this is that for industrial and school buildings, the start of the low occupancy period does not coincide with a drop in internal gains from appliances. According to the assumptions considered in this paper, most of the appliances in school and industrial buildings are turned off at time steps 37 (18:00) and 47 (23:00), respectively. Comparing this to the start of their low occupancy period at time steps 35 (17:00) and 39 (19:00) shows that the notable increase in load shifting potential is due to the temperature limits being relaxed while the cooling load is high. On the whole, it could be concluded that load shifting potential in buildings in Singapore is proportional to its cooling load, which is in turn related to solar gain. Therefore, it is expected that on a typical day in Singapore, buildings should offer the most amount of flexibility during daytime. However, this is limited by the temperature limits being imposed to ensure occupant comfort in the buildings, which is why buildings with typically low occupancy during daytime (hotel, single and multi-residential) possess the highest amount of flexibility in terms of load shifting potential. Seeing as different building types offer different flexibility profiles, there is significant potential to make use of DSF in buildings with cooling loads in Singapore. However, Fig. 16 also shows that almost no flexibility from buildings is observed from midnight to around early morning, which rules out the possibility of buildings being the single source of flexibility in Singapore\u2019s electricity system. 4.2 Bidding strategy evaluation The dispatch profiles of the Downtown Core district considering flat-price scheduling and demand side bidding, alongside market clearing prices for the three scenarios considered are given in Figs. 17, 18, and 19. From the first two figures, it could be seen that the dispatch profiles for scenarios 1 and 2 are identical whether flat-price scheduling or demand-side bidding is considered. The only difference lies in the profile of the market clearing prices, as prices in the second scenario are lower during daytime due to PV generation. Therefore, it could be concluded that the cost reduction seen in case of 10 GWp PV penetration in Singapore\u2019s electricity system is attributed to the reduction of wholesale prices due to increased renewables penetration. The total electricity costs of all buildings in the district for a day of operation amount to 856,490 and 512,521 S$ for scenarios 1 and 2, respectively. Meanwhile, the total energy consumption in both cases is equal to 9,997 MWh. Scenario 3, however, presents a different story compared to the first two scenarios. It could be seen in Fig. 19 that the dispatch profile when demand-side bidding is in place differs to that of the flat-price scheduling. Between time steps 22 (10:30) and 37 (18:00), the clearing prices fluctuate significantly and so does the dispatch profile with demand-side bidding implemented, although in the latter case it is more evident in the early parts of this interval. Demand-side bidding allows consumers to take advantage of the price valleys occurring during this period, hence reducing the amount of electricity they need to consume when price spikes appear. This behavior is most evident between time steps 24 (11:30) to 29 (14:00). At 11:30, the electricity price is 29.6 S$/MWh and this causes the total electricity dispatch to increase from 900 MW with flat-price scheduling to 1057 MW with demand-side bidding, representing a 17% increase. This is immediately followed by period during which a price spike is observed, rising the clearing price to the level of 79.96 S$/MWh. Since more electricity has been consumed for pre-cooling in the preceding time step, a load reduction of 11% could be achieved, going down from 929 MW in the case of flat-price scheduling to 830 MW with demand-side bidding. In the following two groups of price valley/price spike, the total electricity dispatch is elevated by 16 and 17% during price valley periods and reductions of 11 and 10% are observed during the corresponding price spike periods. Due to the fact that some of the energy that is used for pre-cooling is lost to the environment, it is always the case that the increase in power used for pre-cooling is greater than the consequent power reduction. This means that the overall energy consumption in buildings actually increases when demand-side bidding is implemented to take advantage of extreme fluctuations in market clearing prices. The total amount of energy consumed in the case of flat-price scheduling is equal to 9,997 MWh, rising to 10,080 MWh with the implementation of demand-side bidding and reflecting a 0.8% increase. On the other hand, the total electricity cost for all buildings goes down from 670,899 to 664,530 S$, representing a 0.9% decrease. These figures are comparable to the numbers found in [38], where DSF in air-conditioned buildings in Singapore reduces the total cost in the electricity system by 0.81% while increasing the energy consumption by 0.25%. This shows that DSF in air-conditioned buildings is not only about consuming electricity efficiently, but also effectively. Table 8 presents a summary of the distribution of the cost reduction in Downtown Core buildings. It could be observed that for most of the buildings, the overall cost reduction falls within the range of 0 to 1%, indicating that the vast majority of the buildings do not actually benefit from demand-side bidding. On the other hand, several buildings could save around 4 to 7% of their electricity cost through demand-side bidding. These buildings are either multi-residential or hotel buildings. As the result of the load shifting potential quantification shows, these buildings benefit from increased flexibility during daytime due to low occupancy, which in turn allows them to take full advantage of the price profile found in scenario 3. According to [44], a decrease in energy costs of around 25% could be achieved in residential buildings by employing a rule-based control strategy for HVAC systems. However, this applies only to single building planning since the authors assumed the status quo, i.e. buildings are price-takers in the electricity market. With demand-side bidding, such cost savings are only achievable when some buildings have a huge market power so as to create price fluctuations, which is not the case with this paper\u2019s case study. In the case of demand-side bidding as demonstrated in scenario 3, consumers participating in demand-side bidding could take advantage of low electricity prices by pre-cooling their buildings in anticipation of high prices. While this would no doubt increase their total electricity consumption, cost savings could be achieved provided that a reliable price forecast could be obtained. The extent to which this could be done, however, depends on the occupant comfort constraints which are imposed and on the construction material properties of the buildings. A more relaxed set of comfort constraints means more flexibility, thereby higher potential to benefit from demand-side bidding. Meanwhile, buildings with higher thermal capacity might be able to take better advantage of pre-cooling due to their ability to prevent outside heat from seeping in. Alternatively, consumers could also consider active electricity storage systems such as batteries to further increase their consumption flexibility. 4.2.1 Sensitivity analysis Lower temperature limit. Fig. 20 shows the result of the sensitivity analysis on lower temperature limit. From the figure, it could be seen that reducing the minimum temperature allowed during high occupancy periods has a sizable effect on electricity cost reduction when comparing flat-price scheduling and demand side bidding. Lowering the temperature limit by 1 °C results in a further decrease of 0.3% in total electricity cost, relative to the case\u2019s baseline. Since lowering the minimum temperature limit means that the buildings could take more advantage of periods with low electricity price in daytime by absorbing more electricity for pre-cooling, i.e. more flexibility, a higher cost reduction is expected. In the highest flexibility scenario considered, lowering the minimum temperature by 3 °C doubles the relative decrease of total electricity cost from 0.9% in the default scenario to 1.8%. While a reduction of 1.8% might not sound like much, in monetary values it amounts to a saving of 12,256 S$. This represents significant potential savings for consumers, especially considering that the value given is only for a day of operation. Frequency of price spikes. Result of the sensitivity analysis on frequency of price spikes is presented in Fig. 21. The figure shows that when the price spikes occur in a less frequent manner compared to the extreme case considered in the baseline, potential electricity cost reduction through demand-side bidding effectively disappears. In fact, as the price spikes become less frequent, the total electricity cost increases, although not by much. For cases P1 and P2, the total electricity cost increases by 0.1 and 0.2%, respectively when demand-side bidding is implemented. This could be attributed to wasteful pre-cooling during periods of low electricity price. In the baseline, during the disturbance period an interval with low price is always followed by a high price interval, meaning that any pre-cooling conducted during the former is always beneficial to reduce electricity consumption during the latter. In the two cases considered for the sensitivity analysis, the periods between price spikes are always filled by several time steps with low electricity price, which causes the energy used for pre-cooling to go to waste since it would have been lost to the environment by the time the next price spike is observed. Alternatively, it could also be attributed to the nature of the price forecast model used in this paper. Since ARMA is a short-term forecasting model, it does not have the ability to predict price spikes accurately when they occur without a clear pattern. Therefore, the results obtained here highlights the importance of having an accurate price forecast model to produce more informed demand bids and in turn, profit from demand-side bidding. 4.2.2 Centralized dispatch comparison By implementing centralized dispatch, the total electricity cost of all buildings sums up to 659,029 S$, which reflects a 1.8% reduction compared to flat-price scheduling. As expected, the cost reduction in the case of centralized dispatch is greater than that of demand-side bidding, as the former should theoretically represent a ceiling on the magnitude of achievable cost reduction given the perfect knowledge of all the resources involved in the market. Furthermore, in practice, the latter should only be able to take partial advantage of their flexibility given the limitations of the bidding structure of the market and the price forecast used to form the demand bids. In addition, it also demonstrates that demand-side bidding should be considered when designing market policies to incentivize DSF, as a fair amount of value could be captured as demonstrated by the examples in this paper. The differences in the dispatch profile between demand-side bidding and centralized dispatch are shown in Fig. 22. It could be seen that the centralized dispatch setup is able to make better use of the low price periods occurring in the market, as pre-cooling is conducted more frequently compared to demand-side bidding, namely at 09:30, 10:30, 14:30, 15:30, and 16:30 h. An additional 116 MWh is consumed compared to demand-side bidding, representing an increase of 1.1%. Again, this highlights the importance of effective use of energy in comparison to energy efficiency. Since the dispatch profile of the district differs when considering centralized dispatch as opposed to demand-side bidding, this affects the market clearing prices, illustrated in Fig. 23. The market clearing simulation used in this paper takes into account the residual demand of the system when determining market clearing prices, which explains why the clearing price profile only differs slightly between the two cases. The most evident changes are encountered in time steps 20 (09:30) and 21 (10:00). In the former, centralized dispatch increases the market clearing price from 39.6 to 41.8 S$/MWh, while in the latter it causes a slight drop in price from 83.6 to 80.6 S$/MWh. Being able to affect market clearing prices is part of the reason why optimal demand scheduling is desired, as it allows for better use of resources when energy supply is abundant, e.g. when PV production is sufficiently high. 4.3 Linear bid curves comparison Fig. 24 presents a comparison of dispatch profiles considering demand bids are submitted as block bids (price-quantity pairs) or linear curves. From the figure, it could be seen that in the linear curves setup, more pre-cooling is conducted, similar to what is encountered in the centralized dispatch setup. This might be down to the fact that the bids are, by nature, more flexible when they are interpreted as linear curves as opposed to block bids. In the latter case, low price bids are either dispatched fully or not at all, depending on whether the market clearing price is lower than the stated price. It is evident then, that price points in the bids play a crucial role in determining whether or not buildings could take advantage of low electricity prices in the market. However, when bids are considered as linear curves, the price points do not matter as much. Since dispatch quantities are determined through linear interpolation when the market clearing price falls between two price points, consumers would still consume close to the maximum amount that they bid into the market even if the market clearing price is slightly above their minimum price point. From a cost perspective, the linear curves setup records a total electricity cost of 663,408 S$, which is slightly lower than the total cost in the block bids setup and represents a 1.1% reduction compared to flat-price scheduling. This means that the setup explored here performs slightly better than the default block bids setup, as it is closer to the centralized dispatch setup in terms of dispatch profile and cost reduction. On the whole, it could be concluded that the linear curves setup might be more suited to foster DSF through demand-side bidding as opposed to the block bids setup due to its flexible nature. It is important to note how different seasons might impact the results obtained in this paper. The monsoon season encountered in Singapore will significantly affect the results. During this season, lower temperatures are expected, leading to lower cooling load and lower load shifting potential. At the same time, solar energy production during this period will be significantly less, thereby limiting the utilization of DSF potential for pre-cooling during periods of high solar production. It is therefore expected that the potential benefits of DSF through demand-side bidding will be severely limited during the monsoon season, coming back to the situation of the status quo - as indicated by the results of scenario 1. 5 Conclusion Based on the results obtained, the following conclusions are proposed: \u2022 Through analysis from several sources, ten major building types are identified for Singapore\u2019s building stock: hotel, hospital, single residential, multi-residential, school, university, office, retail, industrial, and other. By having representative parameter sets for these building types, their DSF potential could be calculated through optimal load scheduling with linear programming. Assuming that prices could vary by a certain magnitude, e.g. 50% as assumed in this paper, DSF potential could be calculated as the difference between the optimal load when electricity price goes up by 50% and the same variable under a 50% price decrease. The results obtained indicate that different building types possess different flexibility profiles over the course of a day and this is largely dependent on the cooling load that buildings are exposed to, as well as their comfort constraint schedules. \u2022 Optimal load scheduling is an option for generating demand bids for buildings. In a similar way to how DSF potential is calculated, running optimal load scheduling with various price configurations yields optimal load levels, which could be interpreted as price-quantity pairs to be bid into the market. For this purpose, price configurations could be derived by analyzing prices in the electricity market and building a forecast model, for which an ARMA model is used in this paper. Electricity price forecast serves as consumers\u2019 expectation of possible outcomes in the market, which consumers could base their bids on. \u2022 The case study shows that when extreme price fluctuations are encountered in the electricity market, demand-side bidding implementation has the potential to increase social welfare in the electricity market by reducing consumers\u2019 total electricity cost. This is demonstrated by a reduction of 0.9% in terms of total electricity cost when demand-side bidding is implemented as opposed to flat-price scheduling, amounting to 6369 S$ per day. By lowering the minimum temperature allowed for occupant comfort by 1 °C, a further reduction of 0.3% is possible. Demand-side bidding enables cost reduction by allowing consumers to indicate their implicit DSF potential through their demand bids, which in turn allows them to consume more electricity when prices are sufficiently low and less when prices are high. Compared to centralized dispatch, which achieves an overall cost reduction of 1.8%, demand-side bidding achieves lesser cost savings. This represents an opportunity for improvement, which could be addressed by implementing linear curves based setup, as opposed to the price-quantity pairs setup currently found in Singapore\u2019s wholesale market. A reduction of 1.1% in total electricity cost is observed in this case. This work serves as a preliminary work delving into how demand-side bidding could be implemented to harness DSF potential in Singapore\u2019s electricity market. The results show that there is an opportunity to implement demand-side bidding to reduce consumers\u2019 electricity cost, which is achieved by incentivizing consumers to better plan their electricity use, and improve the effectiveness of electricity consumption in general. As the results of the load shifting potential calculation show, hotel and residential buildings demonstrate the highest amount of DSF potential. Thereby, implementing the methodology proposed in this paper to another district in Singapore which is dominated by these building types as a case study would naturally increase the cost savings compared to the numbers shown here. It will be interesting to explore the possible cost savings in other districts in Singapore and the country as a whole in future work. Going even further, the whole process starting from building data acquisition could be repeated to obtain the distribution of buildings in other cities and derive representative parameter sets for these buildings, allowing the analysis conducted in this paper to be replicated for other parts of the world. This possibility is naturally limited by data availability but it should be interesting to see how DSF potential compares from country-to-country, e.g. Singapore (tropical climate) and Sweden (temperate climate). The deployment of energy storage systems might be of particular interest in future developments. In this work, DSF potential in buildings was only be harnessed by pre-cooling buildings during low electricity price periods, which is limited by the minimum temperature allowed in the buildings for indoor comfort. Phase change materials (PCMs) could be an option to increase the thermal inertia of buildings and allow the walls of the buildings to act as a passive energy storage system. Alternatively, active energy storage systems such as large-scale batteries could also be considered. By employing this kind of systems, it is expected that a substantial increase in DSF potential would be observed, as more electricity could be stored in the storage systems for later use. This would also circumvent the issue of energy loss caused by pre-cooling and allowing load shifting to be conducted between time periods which are located further apart, as opposed to limiting load shifting only to neighboring periods as observed here. As the increased flexibility brought about by energy storage systems would no doubt increase the cost savings on the consumer side, an economic analysis could then be conducted to determine whether it would make sense for consumers to invest in these storage systems. This analysis would undoubtedly help shed further light on the feasibility of utilizing DSF potential through demand-side bidding.

        "dc:description": "Demand-side flexibility (DSF) has been touted as a possible solution to the challenges in power system operation arising from increasing intermittent renewables penetration and the emergence of electric vehicles. In Singapore, where around 24 to 60% of electricity demand in buildings could be attributed to heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) purposes, air-conditioned buildings represent a significant flexibility resource which could be used to provide DSF and help tackle these challenges. This study aims to investigate the DSF potential of Singapore\u2019s building stock and to explore how this potential could be realized through demand-side bidding. To this end, a building energy modeling tool with explicit modeling of the relationship between occupant comfort and HVAC load with model predictive control, CoBMo, is used. CoBMo allows optimal load scheduling to be expressed as a linear programming problem: minimizing overall electricity cost while maintaining occupant comfort. A price-based market clearing model is developed to evaluate demand-side bidding implementation, for which a case study on Singapore\u2019s Downtown Core district is developed. Three scenarios with possible future utility-scale photovoltaic (PV) penetration in Singapore\u2019s electricity system are explored, alongside a sensitivity analysis and a comparison between centralized dispatch and demand-side bidding with price-quantity pairs and linear curves. Results of the analysis show that DSF potential varies between building types, depending on cooling load and occupancy schedule. When extreme price fluctuations happen in future Singapore electricity market with 10 GWp PV penetration, demand-side bidding could aid consumers to utilize their DSF potential by encouraging more effective energy use and in turn, reducing their total electricity cost.",
