Demand Response is used to reduce the mismatch between electricity generation by renewable energy sources and electricity demand. Buildings are large energy consumers and can play an important role in matching generation and demand. Energy flexibility is defined as the ability of a building to manage its generation and demand according to local climate conditions, user needs and grid requirements. This article focuses on the thermal mass of buildings as a source of energy flexibility. The investigation is based on a characterization assessment method on single building level and on aggregator level. On single building level, different building parameters such as the thermal capacity of the construction, window to wall ratio, façade insulation and glazing properties are investigated and their impact on the energy flexibility is assessed. The thermal capacity and window to wall ratio are considered the most influential in the studied buildings. The characterization assessment shows a minimum 0.14 and a maximum 0.34 kWh/m2 potential shiftable energy. The results of the characterization assessment method are compared with Demand Response events under more realistic conditions for specific case study buildings. The results show to be representative of the potential shiftable energy of a building envelope. The results show that in certain cases, the potential shiftable energy by the thermal mass of the building is comparable to the capacity of a commercial battery for utility buildings (232 kWh). Finally, the aggregated flexibility of clusters of Dutch office buildings is investigated and analogized to different electrical battery storage projects around the world. The results show that the thermal mass of 17 reference buildings show the potential of a storage capacity close to the biggest electrical battery projects in the Netherlands. The limitations of this study and advantages and disadvantages of electrical storage and thermal mass storage are discussed. Keywords Energy flexibility Thermal mass Aggregator Building parameters Thermal comfort control strategies Characterization assessment 1 Introduction 1.1 Demand response The integration of renewable energy sources in national energy systems is required in order to reach the goals towards a carbon neutral society [1,2]. These sources may refer to electrical and heating energy. In this research we focus on electrical energy from RES and the fact these sources, such as solar and wind, have a stochastic nature, which results in fluctuations in the electricity production. Due to these fluctuations a mismatch could occur between the electricity production and demand. Renewable energy sources that produce heat could also fall into the same pitfall [3] but this study focuses on electricity. In general, Demand Response is used to reduce this mismatch. The European Commission defined Demand Response as \u2018voluntary changes by end-consumers of their usual electricity use patterns - in response to market signals\u2019 [4]. The market for Demand Response contains various stakeholders. The main beneficiaries of Demand Response (DR) are grid operators and energy suppliers, since they need to compensate for the mismatch between demand and the uncertain RES production [5\u20137]. However, the consumers of electricity (industry, households) can also participate in DR and benefit from DR [8]. For example, consumers can implement controllable appliances in buildings that can be used for automatic DR, such as freezers, dishwashers, etc., but also the building's HVAC system and energy storage devices (e.g. electrical batteries, EVs, etc.) can be used for automatic DR [6,9]. In general DR can be grouped in two programs: implicit DR, which is voluntary price-based (e.g. by day-night tariffs) and explicit DR, which is incentive- and market-based [5]. The explicit DR programs can directly compete on the balancing market. However, since certain load requirements are in place (size of the electricity loads) it is not possible for small consumers (like buildings) to directly participate in these DR programs, but they can still benefit from their energy flexibility by participating via a so-called aggregator [5]. An aggregator is a service provider who operates (directly or indirectly) a set of flexibility sources in order to sell grouped (aggregated) electric loads as single units in the electricity market [10]. The aggregator provides a monetary compensation to the consumers for altering/shifting their electricity pattern. The level of DR penetration is still rather low in Europe, since most consumers are unaware of DR benefits and because they do not have access to automatic DR services [5,6,8,11]. Nonetheless, several countries are changing their policies to promote DR. For example in Portugal and Spain, recent changes in the law related to self-consumption of electricity opened the door to act at cluster level with Local Energy Communities [12]. In France 25% of the electrical heating systems should be equipped with a dynamic controller by 2030, while Time of Use (ToU) tariff structures are already widely adopted by French customers (41%) [13]. Canada also has widely used ToU tariffs; as a result, the peak demand often represents a significant share of total electricity costs in commercial buildings [14]. In the UK aggregators offer incentives to hotels to provide demand response from their HVAC systems and in Ireland, multiple demand side units consisting of portfolios of aggregated responsive sites are operating in the Integrated-Single Electricity Market [14]. In some EU countries aggregators already participate in the balancing market (e.g. UK and Germany), while in other countries this is not common or possible yet [14]. In the Netherlands, the Dutch electricity market is currently offering opportunities to unlock and valorise energy flexibility from buildings. As more and more renewable sources are expected to penetrate the electricity mix, the demand of flexibility in the intraday and balancing market will increase and thus, flexibility will be more valuable [15]. Moreover, challenges related to privacy issues, user acceptance and security are still hindering wide-scale applications of automatic DR [16]. In order to be able to respond to demand response events, buildings have to be flexible and able to shift their demand. 1.2 Energy flexibility of buildings The built environment is responsible for a large part of the worldwide electricity consumption [17], therefore the building research community focuses on demand response in relation to buildings. For example, the IEA EBC Annex 67 project [18] investigated the energy flexibility that can be provided by buildings. Annex 67 defines the energy flexibility of a building as its ability to manage its demand and generation according to local climate conditions, user needs and grid requirements. For example, the electricity demand of a building can be shaped by using certain heating and cooling strategies which exploit the thermal storage capacity of a building (thermal mass). Annex 67 stresses that the new generation of buildings should not only consider the building as a stand-alone entity but also as interacting with other buildings and energy systems on the scale of clusters [19]. With respect to DR and energy flexibility, new business opportunities emerge for building owners and facility managers. For example, it could be interesting for a facility manager to offer the energy flexibility of his building to an aggregator on the market and thus reduce the operational costs of the building. The aggregator can group the flexibility of multiple buildings in order to generate enough flexibility volume for the market. In this context it is important to understand how much energy flexibility a building can offer. The available energy flexibility of a building is influenced by various aspects, among others the building design (building size, window size, thermal mass, orientation, etc.), the HVAC system, the HVAC control strategies, the behavior of the building occupants and the weather conditions around the building. It is yet unclear how much influence each of the building design related aspects have on the available energy flexibility. Understanding the influence of these design related parameters on the energy flexibility was one of the objectives of the research described here. As the thermal mass of buildings is available at zero additional cost, it is of great interest to analyze the possibility of storing and releasing heat and cold in the thermal mass during DR events. Therefore, the work specifically focused on exploiting the building's thermal mass as a source of energy flexibility. 1.3 Energy flexibility quantification and indicators In literature, various studies aim at analysing and quantifying the flexibility of a building. An indirect analysis of flexibility through examining performance indicators such as operational cost savings, reduction of CO2 emissions or shaving (elimination) of peaks in the demand by shifting loads in time, have been investigated in studies that look into newly proposed control strategies at system level [20,23,24] and for thermal mass [21,22]. There are also studies that suggest ways to quantify or predict the flexibility of a building. These studies quantify the flexibility, e.g., by the number of hours the energy consumption can be delayed or anticipated [25,26], or by quantifying the power or the energy that can be shifted through different assessment methods as proposed in, e.g., Refs. [18,27\u201330]. The aforementioned studies focus either on the flexibility offered by a heat pump or thermal energy storage in tanks [25\u201327] or the flexibility that a heating system can offer through utilizing the thermal mass of the building, examples of which are to be found in Refs. [18,27\u201330]. Most of these studies are applied to a specific case study building and system. The economic aspect is also introduced in the works of [28] via cost curves but also in Refs. [30\u201332]. Claus et al. [33] provides an overview of specific energy flexibility indicators. They stress that future research in the subject must look into the limitations and robustness of the indicators. The flexibility indicators that are available in literature, consider mostly only one source of flexibility in a building. It remains a challenge to express the flexibility of a combination of sources through one indicator. As the research focused on the flexibility of a building offered by its thermal mass in combination with different types of envelopes, from the available indicators, an appropriate indicator is chosen based on the aim and goal of this study. For a building to be able to exploit its thermal mass, the most straightforward way is to differentiate the setpoints of the HVAC system. To be able to guarantee comfort levels of the occupants while changing the setpoints of the system, carefully chosen thermal comfort control strategies have to be used. 1.4 Thermal comfort control strategies One of the most important reasons for energy use in buildings is providing thermal comfort. This is of key importance in most buildings (offices, residential, shops, etc.) and should never be compromised when using DR events. Building designers can use specific standards in order to design buildings with high thermal comfort [34,35]. Generally, these standards assume steady-state conditions. In the context of the work described here, we also qualify the adaptive thermal comfort theory [36] as steady-state, as it assumes a reflection of the outdoor conditions over a period of days. Contrarily, in this work we focus on thermal comfort in heterogeneous and dynamic indoor conditions, assuming variations within a timeframe of minutes or hours. It does include the notion, similar to the adaptive thermal comfort theory, that occupants are not passive recipients of the indoor environment and may have physiological, behavioral and psychological responses to correct unfavorable conditions. ASHRAE standards, based on climate chamber research, suggest that limited cyclic variations and ramps in operative temperature are thought not to affect thermal comfort within certain boundaries [34]. Other, in-situ, thermal comfort research [37\u201340], also shows that these typical comfort limits can be (temporarily) relaxed or bypassed in some ways without compromising the thermal comfort of occupants. This (temporary) relaxation in thermal requirements can be used in specific thermal comfort control strategies to optimize the DR of the building's energy consumption. Following this knowledge, in this research we focused on the energy flexibility potential that can be expected when using such heterogeneous and dynamic comfort control strategies in combination with the building's thermal mass. The scope is on office buildings in the Netherlands. DR is regarded an important mean to deal with the variability in energy availability due to the integration of renewable energy sources in (inter-)national energy systems. The energy flexibility that is needed for that may be found in buildings, specifically its thermal mass, though other building characteristics may contribute to this potential as well. Its potential, nevertheless, has not been quantified in an appropriate way to assess its contribution in DR events in more general terms and for groups or types of buildings. In this context we also see that the potential may be toned by too strict settings for the thermal comfort boundary conditions that assume steady-state conditions, whereas recent research indicates that more lenience is available and may even be advocated. As a result, the potential of buildings in providing energy flexibility for DR-events has not been explored to its full extent, and therefore may be underrated. This also accounts for a more detailed assessment of the contribution of typical building characteristics in the flexibility that a building can provide. The above analysis and status results in the main objective of the research presented, which is to quantify the energy flexibility potential that Dutch office buildings can provide by using thermal comfort control strategies and by utilizing their thermal mass. The quantified energy flexibility potential of the thermal mass will be analyzed regarding capacity to other sources of flexibility. 2 Methodology In order to investigate the energy flexibility of typical variations of Dutch office buildings, an approach could be to find the preferred combination of design parameters in real buildings and conduct measurements in those buildings. This would require extensive efforts, while having the limitations that comparison between the investigated buildings is hampered by (realistically) unavoidable differences in boundary conditions for the building, such as use, location and climate conditions. This most probably would undermine a fair comparison of the outcomes for the building variants. Limitations in the number of buildings that can be investigated and control of the boundary conditions, are further reasons to advocate the use of computational building simulation as the main research method. This therefore is regarded a more fit for purpose strategy for this study. Its application will be detailed further below. To investigate the energy flexibility potential of the Dutch office buildings the following steps are taken. As a first step, an investigation of the Dutch office building stock is conducted in order to identify the main building characteristics of Dutch office buildings. The goal is to define building design parameters and parameter value ranges that represent typical office buildings in the Netherlands. Following this step, a building sample is defined which represents the Dutch office building stock. Next, the key performance indicators related to energy flexibility are defined. Subsequently a building performance simulation model is developed. The model is able to calculate all the relevant performance indicators. Finally, the results are analyzed and discussed on two different levels: single building level and aggregator level. At single building level, the theoretical potential energy flexibility is assessed and whether that is representative for realistic conditions. At both levels, the quantified energy flexibility is compared to other sources of flexibility regarding capacity, in order to understand its potential. The steps in the research methodology are summarized in Fig. 1 . 2.1 Step 1 - Analysis Dutch office building stock In order to understand the potential of energy flexibility in the Dutch context, the Dutch office building stock was analyzed. Currently, there are approximately 55 million square meters of office buildings in the Netherlands, of which 25% [41] were built before 1977 and around 80% before 2000. Energiebesparingsmonitor Utiliteit (2002), gives an overview of the insulation levels in Dutch office buildings. Only 3% of the offices are designed with a façade with a Rc value of 2.5 K/Wm2 or higher [42]. The energy label database indicates that 50% of the office buildings that have acquired an energy label, have a label D or lower, while 30% of the buildings in the energy label database have a label A (best performance). It should be noted that most office buildings that are older and non-efficient are not included in the energy label database at all. Based on newly applied regulations, all office buildings in the Netherlands need to acquire an energy label C or higher by 2023 [43]. That means that a significant number of office buildings will need to be renovated and their insulation levels will change. Especially insulation levels in the façade and glazing will improve, as they are the most prominent measures for a renovation focused on energy efficiency. Input from semi-structured interviews with 10 building experts (with a wide range of titles -building consultants, advisors, building designers, sustainability advisors, energy consultants etc) have been used in order to identify the most realistic cases concerning the parameters for the building stock and their typical values for the Dutch market. From this analysis the ones summarized in Table 1 are included in this study; in case of numerical values, ranges for these parameters are set as well. Two types of offices are considered: a cellular office and an open plan office. More details about the materials of the various constructions and their respective material properties can be found in the Appendix. Based on the width and depth parameters of Tables 1 and 6 different geometries are investigated (3 m × 6 m, 3 m × 9 m, 4.5 m × 6 m, etc.). These 6 different geometries are combined with 3 different window to wall ratios. In this way, from all combinations of the building parameter values defined in Table 1, a total of 3888 possible configurations for a Dutch office building have been defined and included in this research. 2.2 Define thermal comfort control strategies For the cases investigated, typical thermal comfort control strategies that are normally applied in Dutch offices are considered [44]. Furthermore, several heterogeneous and dynamic strategies depicted in Table 2 are included, amongst others based on literature about adaptive thermal comfort. These strategies have been validated through physical measurements in Dutch office buildings and are considered fit for this investigation. Loomans and Mishra [37\u201340,45] concluded that for the investigated buildings, transition spaces such as corridors can have different setpoints than the working spaces without affecting the thermal comfort of the occupants. Lastly, diurnal variations were studied also by Ivanova et al. [46] and showed that differences of 3 °C do not affect the thermal comfort perception of the occupants. All these observations are implemented as different thermal comfort control strategies. The strategies are all in line with conditions deemed acceptable according to ASHRAE [34] which generally have a basis in climate chamber research. To explore the effect it could have on the performance indicator, we included one more extreme value for each strategy. As a result, nine thermal comfort control strategies are investigated (Table 2). In this study, thermal comfort is set as a boundary condition. The operative temperatures applied assume an office environment with a metabolic rate of 1.1 met and clothing values from 0.75 to 0.9. Assumptions for the air velocity and relative humidity are assumed to be within normal comfort range which would not affect the thermal comfort perception. Note that in this research we are less interested in the steady-state thermal comfort perception, as e.g. reflected in the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) but in the perception of short term adaptations as investigated in the references mentioned above. 2.3 Key performance indicators- assessments performed 2.3.1 Energy flexibility characterization There are several ways to assess the flexibility potential of a building. Different indicators and different methodologies have been proposed in literature as discussed in the Introduction and have been considered for this study. This study focuses on comparing different building envelopes and the potential flexibility that they might offer. It does not intend to quantify the actual flexibility that can be expected during operation in a specific building. The aim is to understand the effect of different building properties on the potential flexibility of an envelope and how that compares with other types of envelopes. Following this point-of-departure we found the indicator proposed by Annex 67 [18] to be the most suitable indicator. The indicator proposed by Annex 67 and the characterization assessment eliminates several operational uncertainties, such as the type of controller and the type of heating system, but also non-building specific uncertainties such as the weather and occupant influences. This is a unique characteristic of the Annex 67 indicator and fits closely with the scope of this study to identify the impact of the building characteristics on the energy flexibility. The indicator as proposed in Annex 67 is based on the energy flexibility indicators defined by Grønborg et al. [18]. They introduce the Flexibility Function methodology to characterize the energy flexibility. The Flexibility Function assumes a building in a steady state condition for every time step and a penalty signal that is given by the controller (price, CO2 etc.). The signal aims to control the demand. Before the signal is given, the building is operated in the highest (in winter) or lowest (in summer) breach of the temperature range that is acceptable. Whether it is summer or winter is decided based on the constant outside temperature that is assumed. When the building receives the signal, the terminal system is either shut down or it lowers its setpoint to save on operational cost (as seen in Fig. 2 and Table 3 , the setpoint is lowered). The terminal system starts to consume energy again when comfort or temperature values fall outside the accepted range of values (e.g. when the temperatures are <20 °C or >25 °C). The shaded area Part A in Fig. 2 is considered as the amount of energy that can be shifted during a DR event and it gives an indication of the potential of energy flexibility that a building design can provide. The shiftable energy is expressed in kWh/m2 of floor area for one demand response event. The method to assess this indicator assumes a constant temperature and no solar irradiation. Therefore, the result of the quantified energy flexibility is only depended on the building design (thermal mass, window size, Rc-values, etc.) and there is no influence of the weather. The benefit of this approach is that it allows for a comparison between building variations, which makes it easier to understand which design parameter values influence the potential shiftable energy. Note that by excluding solar irradiation, the orientation also does not play a role in the comparison of the building variations. All variations, presented in Table 1 are investigated under this assessment. 2.3.2 Energy flexibility assessment under realistic weather conditions and building use As the described energy flexibility characterization method presents the theoretical maximum potential of flexibility that a building design can offer, a second indicator is introduced to obtain a more realistic value of the shiftable energy. This indicator follows the same reasoning as the characterization indicator. The main differences are the initial state of the building and the assumed temperature conditions and solar irradiation. To calculate this energy flexibility indicator, an actual weather file is used [47] and realistic occupancy profiles and internal heat gains were defined from information based on typical offices in the Netherlands (Appendix). The shiftable energy is expressed in kWh/m2 of floor area. The applied weather and occupancy profiles are detailed further in the description of the building energy simulation model in 2.4 and the Appendix. 2.4 Step 2&3 - Create building performance simulation models and performing simulations Building energy simulation (BES) is used to simulate all the office building variations. For that EnergyPlus [48] is used as the simulation engine. Matlab [49] is used in order to automate the procedures of creating the input files to EnergyPlus, executing the simulations and extracting and storing the results. When creating a building energy model it is important to properly define all assumptions and simplifications on building geometry and user behavior; a trade-off needs to be made between accuracy of the model and computational efforts [50]. For this study it is assumed that a reference part of the building can be representative for the overall office building's performance. Based on Georgescu and Mezic [51], a mid-floor is taken as the representative part. Studies that deal with energy consumption, CO2 emissions and gas consumption show that a simulation at room level has no significantly different outcomes than one at floor level and one at building level [52]. Other studies such as Task 56 [53], that focuses on carrying out an analysis on the energy contribution of different solar active façade technologies in covering building loads and to evaluate indoor comfort conditions, show that an office building can be represented by a single office cell simulated in different orientations. The representative middle-floor can be extrapolated by a series of office cells excluding corner offices and services spaces [52]. In order to limit the computational time required for the simulations, and following the above research, the office building model is simplified to a section of it, situated in a middle floor. This simplification is further supported by the fact that a mid-floor and mid-section of a building is most common and therefore has most influence on the energy related results. In this work, three zones (2 cell offices with a corridor; see Fig. 3 ) are chosen to represent each building. The zones are in the mid-floor in the middle of the building [54,55]. Two sides are exposed to the outdoors and are equipped with windows. All other sides are considered in connection with other conditioned zones, so their boundary conditions are adiabatic, but the materials are considered capable of storing energy. Two types of office layout are considered: a cellular office geometry and an open plan geometry. In order to represent the open plan geometry in the computational model, an air wall (a construction with minimal mass) is integrated between the thermal zones. There is no air flow between the thermal zones but an air wall is created with material parameters with high thermal, solar and visible transmittance. The values can be seen in the Appendix. For heating an ideal loads air heating system was assumed connected to the three thermal zones. It is modeled as an ideal VAV terminal unit. The convective heat transfer coefficient is set to the TARP model for the inside (correlation with temperature difference and orientation) and the DOE-2 model for the outside [48]. The model is solved in a 1-min timestep interval. The model is not based on a specific existing building so it cannot be validated with measured performance data. However, the results can be compared to typically values of Dutch offices. The results show to be within the limits of an office building in the Netherlands as defined by Agentschap-NL [56]. Dutch office primary energy usage for buildings with energy label A to G is between 445 and 1620 MJ/m2 annually. The model used in this investigation presents a range of 432\u2013600 MJ/m2 primary energy usage annually considering the high and low insulated cases. The low insulation cases represented by the model in this research compare to a label C type envelope. As a result, the low insulated case considered in the simulations are not representative of low energy classes such as class G, a significant lower energy demand can be expected. Therefore, the results are considered realistic. 2.4.1 Energy flexibility characterization In order to calculate the flexibility indicator, a control is implemented in the model that can give a signal mimicking an increased energy price. To represent that, a specific time is scheduled in the energy management system (EMS) of the Energy Plus model to signal the change of the heat flow to 0 W. A constant outdoor temperature for the heating season is chosen after a preliminary evaluation of the heating and cooling loads in typical Dutch office buildings with natural ventilation strategies implemented. A preliminary yearly analysis showed that cooling loads only represent 10%, on average, of the heating load yearly. As a result, only heating loads were investigated further in this study. Based on the preliminary investigation, and in line with Annex 67 [18], an appropriate constant outdoor temperature is determined. Accordingly, a weather file is created with the outdoor temperature set to 15 °C, solar irradiation to 0 W/m2 and the wind speed at 0 m/s. The heating setpoint of the building model is set to 24 °C. The solar radiation is excluded as the characterization assessment suggests [18], and infiltration of the envelopes as well as the ventilation rate is set to 0.5 ACH. The infiltration rate is based on reference office building data and the ventilation rate is chosen after a sensitivity analysis. A higher rate is dismissed in order for the ventilation not to dominate the results and the model to be able to showcase the thermal mass\u2019 potential. This is due to the fact that heat recovery could not be initiated in the model approach taken. As we are interested in relative outcomes, i.e., a comparison between defined configurations, the fact that ventilation rate is less realistic is not concerning. Apart from that, the characterization assessment is performed in unrealistic conditions in any case (i.e., no solar radiation, fixed outdoor temperature, etc.). Finally, a heat pump connected to the distribution system with a COP of 3 is assumed to calculate the source energy demand [57]. 2.4.2 Energy flexibility assessment under realistic weather conditions and building use To calculate this energy flexibility indicator, a realistic weather file is used, and realistic occupancy profiles and internal gains are defined. A Dutch weather file [47] and typical occupancy scenario (Table 14) representative for a Dutch office building are chosen. A more detailed description of the analysis of the energy flexibility assessment for such, more realistic, building configurations (use and climate) is provided for in 2.5 and Table 6. 2.5 Step 4 - analysis of the energy flexibility characterization results 2.5.1 Single building level First, the results are analyzed on a single building level. For that all 3888 office building variations are presented through descriptive statistics in box plots. 2.5.2 Experiment 1: analyzing energy flexibility under realistic weather conditions and building use For the first experiment, an investigation with four cases is performed with the same simulation model as described in 2.4. The envelopes chosen for the analysis are based on the results of the characterization assessment, they represent the highest and lowest rankings. Only the capacity of storage is investigated. Power peak and recharging time are not taken into consideration. The characteristics of the building model used are: 3 m façade, 6 m depth, 3 m height, 0.4 window to wall ratio, 0.5 ACH infiltration and an air-based heating system. The four cases investigated combine parameters for the façade and glazing insulation level [low/high insulation] and thermal mass [lightweight/heavyweight] (Table 4 ). The BENG standard refers to Bijna Energieneutrale Gebouwen \u2013 Nearly zero energy buildings [58]. The cases of heavyweight and lightweight are distinguished based on the position of the insulation layer in the façade wall construction and the construction of inner walls as shown in Fig. 9 in the Appendix. Winter and transition periods were studied. The summer is not considered as based on the preliminary investigation described in 2.4. - The demand response events are investigated on two specific days, The coldest day of the year (21st Jan) and a transition day (3rd of March).The simulations are performed for these days by operating the system at the upper limit of the allowed comfort range for the heating season. This is 24 °C. - Only one thermal control strategy is implemented for providing a signal to the heating/cooling system to stop operating. The building is then free-floating until the temperature reaches the limits of the comfort range, e.g., 20 °C for the heating season. At that point the system starts operating again. For the time that the system is shut down, the difference in the energy demand of the heating system is calculated compared to the energy demand of a reference control strategy (constant highest comfort setpoint of 24 °C) without a change in the heating/cooling setpoint. The calculated difference is regarded as the energy shifting potential. Apart from infiltration that is constant at 0.5ACH, the models include a ventilation rate of 3ACH of fresh air for the occupancy hours. Due to the modelling approach taken, it was not possible to implement heat recovery in the model. As the ventilation rate is relatively high it impacts the results. As the indoor air quality is not considered in the performance analysis, and to assume some heat recovery, the cases are also investigated at a lower rate of 1 ACH. Energy shifting potential is presented in electrical energy when assuming a heat pump with a COP of 3 [57]. The outcome of this investigation regarding the shiftable energy potential is compared with 2 different types of electrical battery capacities for a building of 3000 m2. A battery with a capacity of 40 kWh resembling a Nissan Leaf [59] and a battery of 232 kWh (Tesla Powerpack, Tesla's battery solution for commercial buildings [60]). The batteries are used as a reference for assessing the potential load shifting. 2.5.3 Experiment 2: analyzing energy flexibility under realistic weather conditions, building use, time constraints and thermal comfort control strategies effect The second experiment builds on the first one. In the first experiment the characterization assessment is conducted under realistic weather and occupant conditions in order to validate the trends from the characterization assessment for a typical Dutch weather and occupancy scenario. The assessment is defined by the temperature and there is no specific end time for the event, each envelope performs differently. Given the non-defined timeframe of the assessment and the bandwidth of the comfort range used, the outcomes of Experiment 1 cannot easily be compared to an actual demand response event in a building. To compare the cases under realistic demand response event conditions, the timeframe and control settings are defined in the second experiment. Based on the outcome of thermal comfort control research, more relaxed thermal comfort control strategies are implemented [38\u201340,45]. For the cases considered (Table 5 ) in this experiment only a cellular office layout is assumed to take advantage of the transitional spaces for different thermal comfort control strategies. The façade dimension is 4.5 m to accommodate the reference office building for the Netherlands [42]. A demand response event is simulated for the same two days as for Experiment 1. The demand response event has a duration of 4 h from 8 a.m. to 12 a.m. on a working day. The main difference with the first case study is the fixed duration of the event and the different thermal comfort control strategies included (see Table 2). A reference control strategy is used which has a heating and cooling setpoint of 22 °C when occupied and 15\u201328 °C setpoints when not occupied. The same typical occupancy scenario as in Experiment 1 is used. 2.5.4 Aggregator level The aggregator is not interested in a single building, therefore in this step the energy flexibility in a larger part of the office building stock is investigated. Based on the defined ranges of each parameter (Table 1), the building variations represent ca. 2% of the Dutch office building stock in square meters; more specifically the office buildings built after 2012. These buildings have been estimated to cover around 1.4 million square meters [41]. However, by 2023 all office buildings in The Netherlands are obliged to improve their energy label to label C at minimum [43]. The investigated building variations therefore will represent a significant larger fraction of the total Dutch office building stock by that time. Based on the results of the single building level investigation, the characterization assessment is believed to be representative enough of the theoretical maximum potential of energy flexibility for a cluster of buildings. Considering these buildings, the minimum and maximum energy shifting potential is calculated considering the characterization assessment results. In addition, the entire Dutch office building stock is considered through a reference building. The window to wall ratio (WWR) is set to 0.4 representing the majority of the office buildings in NL and the reference geometry is considered the same as for the single building approach. The entire Dutch office building stock (700 million square meters) is assumed to be renovated with the aforementioned building variations and the potential flexibility offered in that case is calculated. The flexibility that is calculated from these assumptions is the potential (theoretically) available flexibility. This is an ideal scenario. In reality it is not expected to be available at all times, as it heavily depends on the users and how they operate their buildings. It is unknown how much of this flexibility actually can be available to an aggregator at any given time, but this study aims to give a \u2018best case\u2019 indication of the potential flexibility through thermal mass that an aggregator could manage. If this \u2018best case\u2019 situation shows that it cannot compete with others flexibility sources, then it can be concluded that under realistic conditions it would never be a valuable flexibility source. There is no data on the thermal capacity of materials used for each building, so the distribution of heavyweight or lightweight building envelopes throughout the building stock is unknown. To understand the effect on the outcomes of that distribution, cases that range from 100% of the stock's building envelopes being heavyweight to 100% of them being lightweight are investigated. Finally, regarding examining the potential of energy flexibility through thermal mass on a national level, different projects from around the world of collective energy storage are considered. In order to better understand the collective theoretical potential of shiftable energy that thermal mass can provide, each collective energy storage project is also represented by the number of buildings an aggregator would need to manage in order to potentially offer the same capacity. The average size of the office building is assumed at 3000 m2 [56] and it is assumed that each office building can offer the average calculated potential of the total building stock. Only the storage capacity is considered in the comparison. Table 6 gives an overview of the assessments performed in this study, the different inputs, variations and geometries studied. 3 Results 3.1 Single building investigation 3.1.1 Overall assessment The sensitivity of the design parameters has been investigated by presenting various boxplots with a fixed value of one of the design parameters. For example, one boxplot will fix the Rc-value to 3.5 m2K/W, while all the other design parameter values can vary in the defined ranges. By examining the results of the building sample in Fig. 4 , it is observed that the lightweight cases investigated show a lower potential for shifting energy (lower than 0.06 kWh/m2 in all cases in normalized results) compared to the heavyweight cases (0.06\u20130.40 kWh/m2). The cellular offices in the heavyweight cases show the highest potential (0.14\u20130.4 kWh/m2), while the open plan offices do not present results over 0.2 kWh/m2. The higher scoring results appear in the smaller geometries (higher amount of thermal mass in the same square meters) and the lowest U values of the glazing. 3.1.2 Reference geometry In a next step, a reference geometry is chosen to further explore the different cases and showcase the sensitivity of the energy shifting potential of different building design parameters more in-depth. A geometry of 4.5 m room façade by 6 m room depth has been Investigated. It is most widely used in The Netherlands and also part of the reference office building proposed by RvO [56]. A g-value of 0.8 is used in all cases. Four different building variations (Table 7 ) are considered based on Rc façade values and U-values of glazing and different WWR. Office layout and thermal capacity of construction is investigated as well. .In Fig. 5 the energy shifting potential of these building envelopes with different window to wall ratios is presented for the lightweight and heavyweight case. The lightweight case is always represented by a triangle while the heavyweight case is represented by a circle. Different colors represent the different window to wall ratios of the building cases. Note that all results are presented in electrical energy assuming a heatpump with a COP of 3. Results for this window to wall case are augmented to a 3000 m2 office building and depicted in Fig. 5 on the right y axis. \u2022 For the window to wall ratio (WWR) 0.4 case: The average shiftable energy potential of all the renovation options offered for the cellular envelopes is 0.194 kWh/m2 while the open plan envelopes offer considerably less potential with an average of 0.11 kWh/m2. \u2022 For the WWR 0.7 case: The trend is the same with min 0.04 kWh/m2, max 0.31 kWh/m2, average for envelopes with a cellular layout 0.17 kWh/m2 and envelopes with an open plan layout 0.1 kWh/m2. \u2022 For the WWR 1 case: The trend is the same with min 0.032 kWh/m2, max 0.29 kWh/m2, average for envelopes with a cellular layout 0.153 kWh/m2 and envelopes with an open plan layout 0.075 kWh/m2. 3.2 Analyzing energy flexibility under realistic conditions for four building variations 3.2.1 Experiment 1: analyzing energy flexibility under more realistic weather conditions and building use Fig. 6 presents the shiftable energy during a Demand Response Event on 4 specific envelopes on 2 specific days under 2 different ventilation rates. The formal characterization results, as presented above, for the specific building envelopes are included as well. The heavyweight envelope offers more than 0.3 kWh/m2 shiftable energy both in the low and high insulation case. The lightweight envelope offers up to 0.08 kWh/m2 shiftable energy in the high insulated case. 3.2.2 Experiment 2: extending experiment 1 by including time constraints and thermal comfort control strategies effect The results for this case study are presented in Fig. 7 . By exploring different thermal comfort control strategies, the building envelopes of this case study can shift up to 0.043 kWh/m2 during a 4-h demand response event when considering the most extreme strategy of a 3° variation in heating and cooling setpoints and spatial transition strategies in the hallway. The lowest range presented is the heavyweight, high insulated envelope that shifts up to 0.0175 kWh/m2. 3.3 Aggregator level Considering only the buildings that have been investigated based on their parameters, the minimum and maximum energy shifting potential that they can offer ranges from 35.5 MWh up to 563 MWh. This range refers to 2% of the total Dutch office building stock in square meters. Considering a reference building envelope concerning size and WWR for the whole Dutch building stock, and assuming that the Dutch office building stock is renovated with the aforementioned renovation packages, the aggregated results of the Dutch office building stock are presented in Fig. 8 . Fig. 8 depicts the combined flexibility potential of the 2% of the total Dutch office building stock in a range of 100% lightweight envelopes to 100% heavyweight envelopes. In Table 8 the collective potential of the Dutch office building stock is shown and in Table 9 different large scale energy storage solutions are depicted along with the amount of buildings an aggregator should manage in order to be able to offer the same flexibility capacity-wise. Tables 8 and 9 are further discussed in 4.3. 4 Discussion 4.1 Energy flexibility characterization- single building 4.1.1 Overall assessment Regarding the overall assessment depicted in Fig. 4, lightweight buildings do not offer that much flexibility and do not have high differences between them, no matter the other parameters (based on the ones investigated). Another influential parameter is the office layout. The open plan buildings in the heavyweight cases, present similar behavior with the lightweight buildings but with a higher flexibility. Most types of buildings investigated under the characterization assessment of Annex 67 showcase a potential of energy shifting from 0.03 to 0.45 kWh/m2 floor surface. There are different clusters that appear in the investigation and the most impactful parameter is the thermal mass of the construction of the building. Along with the U value of the glazing, they are of high importance for the energy flexibility potential. On the other hand, the Rc value of the façade is not that dominant in the results and so is the g-value of the glazing. The fact that insulation levels do not impact the results as much as glazing insulation could be attributed to the fact that in the model a high percentage of the façade is covered by glazing (window to wall ratio of 40% or higher). 4.1.2 Single building reference geometry From the outcomes of the single reference geometry building analysis showcased in Fig. 5, the minimum shiftable energy potential is observed in the 1st renovation option that also involves the lowest insulation levels. It is the result of a lightweight open plan layout at 0.14 kWh/m2 potential flexibility offered for one demand response event (translates to 420 kWh potential flexibility for a 3000 m2 office). The maximum is observed in the cellular case in the highest insulation levels. That is expected, as more walls are present in this case so more thermal capacity is added to the building envelope. The maximum shiftable energy potential amongst these envelopes is 0.34 kWh/m2. The Open plan layout offers less potential of flexibility compared to the cellular layout. That is expected and justified by the lower thermal capacity that an office layout with no internal walls presents. Furthermore, the higher the glazing percentage in the building envelopes, the lower the potential of shiftable energy is. This is based on the fact that in this investigation the insulation/U-value of the glazing is lower than the façade in any case, resulting in each envelope with higher glazing percentage having lower insulation levels, and with that more heat loss, than the same envelope with lower glazing percentages. In line with this outcome and previous research [73,74], the higher the insulation levels, the more potential there is for shiftable energy. That is attributed to the fundamental property of insulation of reduced heat transfer rate and the fact that each event of the characterization assessment has a different timeframe. The cases with higher insulation levels present longer events (the β parameter as depicted in Fig. 2), thus higher shiftable energy. 4.2 Energy flexibility under realistic conditions for four building variations 4.2.1 Experiment 1 From the analysis of the results of the first experiment and Fig. 6, the insulation levels show a bigger effect in the heavyweight cases while they do not affect the lightweight cases results that much. The lower insulated cases do perform better in some instances, such as the case with high ventilation rate (3 ACH) in spring (March 3rd), by offering higher energy shifting potential as the load is higher and therefore, even though the event might take shorter time to be completed, the final energy shifting potential (the A area as depicted in Fig. 2) might be larger. The difference between the heavyweight (high thermal mass) and lightweight (low thermal mass) case in the results is more than double in all cases but the winter day when considering a high ventilation rate. On that day, due to the cold weather, the ventilation rate has a very high impact on the demand response event resulting in very low energy shifting potential for all four building envelope cases. By lowering the ventilation rate on the 21st of January (assuming heat recovery to be present), the results showcase the ability of a heavyweight building to shift more than a lightweight one. On the transition day (March 3rd) the same effect is observed with higher results based on the higher outside temperatures. This investigation offers more insight into the theoretical potential of flexibility that the characterization assessment gives and gives an indication whether the characterization results have connection with reality. It highlights again the difference between the envelopes with high and low thermal mass (in line with the characterization assessment) but also shows that the insulation levels do not necessarily dictate which envelope will offer more shifting potential when the weather is taken into account. All cases show a load shifting potential larger than the Nissan leaf battery and all heavyweight cases except one (the investigation in January with high ventilation rate) showcase load shifting potential larger than the Tesla PowerPack battery, which also requires more than 5 m3 of space and weighs 3 tons along with the inverter. An important remark is that occupancy and weather are included in this investigation. Though this modification of the characterization assessment is closer to reality, the assessment is not performed under day to day office conditions. The specific time frame of the event, different thermal comfort control strategies and historical effects are not studied. In this assessment, the complete temperature range for comfort is applied (20\u201324 °C), starting at 24 °C so each system remains shut down until the operative temperature of the room exceeds the lower comfort limit set. That results in long events on the heavyweight envelopes of several hours, compared to more responsive lightweight envelopes that show results in the range of minutes. 4.2.2 Experiment 2 In a last step therefore the second experiment (Fig. 7) includes more realistic parameters of a demand response event than the characterization assessment and Experiment 1. In a set timeframe of a demand response event the results show difference in magnitude in the heavyweight envelope cases compared to Experiment 1. As stated above, in the characterization assessment and Experiment 1 the time frame was open. The event for the heavyweight cases presented timeframes of several hours. When this is constrained to a 4 h event the results are expectedly lower. The lightweight cases present results closer to the ones of Experiment 1 as the timeframes are more similar between the case studies. Moreover, in the previous investigation the temperature comfort range that was studied was 4 °C. In this investigation the most extreme strategy has a lower heating setpoint by 2° and a higher cooling setpoint by 2° than the reference case that was used. The results show that the different setpoints for the transition spaces (corridor) do not result in different energy consumption compared to when the corridor has the same setpoint as the main offices (thus zero shifting potential). This is attributed to the small size of the corridor compared to the cellular offices and therefore may be related to the applied model. The heavyweight case is more affected by the extra insulation as the demand of the highly insulated envelope is already low so the shifting potential is not as high as the low insulated case. The warmer day (March 3rd) in the heavyweight cases offer more shifting potential in all 4 combinations of days and insulation levels while the lightweight cases perform better on the winter day (Jan 21st). All results for the lightweight cases are closer to each other compared to the heavyweight cases where more differences can be deduced between different days and insulation levels. Even though, as expected, the potential shiftable energy is lower than the theoretical cases (characterization assessment, Experiment 1) since the time frame is limited and the comfort range is smaller; by assuming a typical Dutch office building of 3000 m2, all cases but one, showcase a median value for potential shiftable energy that is higher than the capacity of a Nissan Leaf electrical battery. 4.3 Aggregator level Moving away from the single building perspective and looking at the potential of the Dutch Office Buildings as a whole, Fig. 8 gives an overview. The grey dashed box shows the assumed distribution of lightweight and heavyweight buildings in the Dutch building stock. The potential shiftable energy that this distribution could collectively offer per event is in the range of 10 GWh to 15 GWh for a cellular layout and 6 GWh to 9 GWh for an open plan layout depending on the renovation option chosen. Table 8 shows that the office building stock of the Netherlands can showcase a very high potential of combined flexibility. Table 9 shows that the energy flexibility potential of Dutch office buildings through thermal mass can compete (regarding shifting potential) with large scale energy storage projects in Europe and around the world. An aggregator would need 4316 reference type office buildings in order to potentially offer the same storage capacity as the largest battery park project in the world, and just five buildings to be able to reach the storage capacity of the Amsterdam Arena that offers 2.8 MWh of energy. Even though by collecting the energy flexibility of different Dutch office buildings, an aggregator can potentially shift larger amounts of energy than the capacity of different battery projects as currently found around the world, there are several pros and cons for each type of storage. Electrical type of storage projects have a number of advantages over the energy shifting potential of the thermal mass of buildings. Examples would be: fast reaction, availability and independence of occupants and weather [75]. The energy shifting potential of a building involves a lot of uncertainties and its reaction time is not comparable with the one of an electrical battery. On the other hand, exploiting the thermal mass of buildings requires no additional investment and there are no extra materials involved when utilizing it [76,77]. Incorporating electrical type of storage in a building will increase the investment cost of a building design [78]. Furthermore, the thermal mass of the materials in a building construction can offer an unlimited number of cycles in charging and discharging as compared to the finite number of cycles that an electrical type of energy storage can be exposed to before needing replacement. Even though the advantages of electrical storage are important and the differences between the thermal mass and electrical storage should be noted, the shifting energy potential of office buildings is relevant and can help in congestion management on the electrical grid and other types of problems as the energy systems move towards a higher penetration of renewable energy sources [74,76,77]. 4.4 General remarks Preliminary research showcased that the difference in energy consumption and power demand during a demand response event that is repeated each day in a month can vary significantly [79,80]. This study gains further weight when data from actual buildings that operate in a DR mode becomes available. Moreover, only the capacity of storage is investigated in this study and frequency and other parameters of energy storage are not considered. Electrical storage has the ability to be quick in its response and able to provide storage without the uncertainties of weather and without stretching the comfort boundaries of the occupants, though the latter is not regarded a compromise for the utilization of a buildings\u2019 energy flexibility. The thermal mass of a building could potentially offer energy storage but it is unclear when it will be fully charged again for a next event and it does include operating the building in higher or lower acceptance setpoints regarding occupant thermal comfort. It remains uncertain how many of the building owners are willing to change their setpoints and exploit their thermal mass. It may require additional incentives. Finally, even though the above investigation shows the importance of the consideration of thermal mass in energy shifting and the ability to compete with electrical storage in specific dates/cases/situations, the uncertainty of the model used should be considered and the fact that the conclusions are valid for the specific and scenarios defined. In order to assess the ability of a specific building to shift energy during a period (week/season/year) a control optimization is needed. 5 Conclusion Energy flexibility is one of the pillars in defining the smartness of a building and a vital factor in supporting future energy systems. From the investigations conducted, it is concluded that the current Dutch office buildings can offer, through their thermal mass, shiftable energy high enough to compare with most battery projects around the world considering all the limitations of the thermal mass and the advantages of other types of energy storage (e.g. electrical batteries). An aggregator has the potential to offer to the market the same flexibility in terms of capacity with the largest battery project in the Netherlands (10 MWh capacity) by managing 17 reference type office buildings. For the case studies investigated, the shiftable energy in the demand response events is highly dependent on the parameters of each investigation. When exploiting the full bandwidth of comfort and not imposing time limitations on the event, results come close to the characterization assessment at times. Heavyweight constructions offer considerably higher potential of energy flexibility that can under certain conditions be compared with the capacity of a battery for commercial buildings (232 kWh). When more limitations are applied considering time and the thermal comfort control strategies are more realistic, these differences are smoothed but most designs still showcase a shifting potential comparable with at least an electrical car battery (40 kWh). Finally, aggregating the flexibility of the Dutch office buildings can potentially offer valuable balancing services to the local electricity grid noting that utilizing the thermal mass of a building does not include extra costs.

Appendix Materials and Inputs Used The parameters that are considered and investigated along with the specific values that each one takes, were discussed with building experts. Moreover, all different materials and constructions used in the model are discussed and agreed with building experts in the Netherlands. Fig. 9,Tables 10-14 present all materials, constructions and the occupancy scenario used. Infiltration in all models is set to 0.5 ACH constant and the ventilation rate is set to 3 ACH. Due to the modelling approach followed, no heat recovery is implemented. The object that is used to simulate the ventilation rate in the model is simple and implements fresh air in the thermal zone per hour. The ventilation system is turned on and off based on occupancy. External shading is implemented in the form of blinds. Blinds parameters are presented in Table 10.

        "dc:description": "Demand Response is used to reduce the mismatch between electricity generation by renewable energy sources and electricity demand. Buildings are large energy consumers and can play an important role in matching generation and demand. Energy flexibility is defined as the ability of a building to manage its generation and demand according to local climate conditions, user needs and grid requirements. This article focuses on the thermal mass of buildings as a source of energy flexibility. The investigation is based on a characterization assessment method on single building level and on aggregator level. On single building level, different building parameters such as the thermal capacity of the construction, window to wall ratio, façade insulation and glazing properties are investigated and their impact on the energy flexibility is assessed. The thermal capacity and window to wall ratio are considered the most influential in the studied buildings. The characterization assessment shows a minimum 0.14 and a maximum 0.34 kWh/m2 potential shiftable energy. The results of the characterization assessment method are compared with Demand Response events under more realistic conditions for specific case study buildings. The results show to be representative of the potential shiftable energy of a building envelope. The results show that in certain cases, the potential shiftable energy by the thermal mass of the building is comparable to the capacity of a commercial battery for utility buildings (232 kWh). Finally, the aggregated flexibility of clusters of Dutch office buildings is investigated and analogized to different electrical battery storage projects around the world. The results show that the thermal mass of 17 reference buildings show the potential of a storage capacity close to the biggest electrical battery projects in the Netherlands. The limitations of this study and advantages and disadvantages of electrical storage and thermal mass storage are discussed.",
