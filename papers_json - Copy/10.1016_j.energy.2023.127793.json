Handling Editor: Henrik Lund In recent times, the tremendous progress in electronic devices and making them available to all consumers has led to an increase in demand for energy, the formation of a peak, and an increase in the electricity bill of the consumer. Buildings are considered one of the main sectors of energy consumption. Improving the energy efficiency of these buildings will achieve economic and environmental goals. This paper proposes a modified algorithm for scheduling electrical appliances in the smart home to reduce the electricity bill, improve the network, maximize customer comfort and reduce peak formation. This paper uses load conversion to change the shape of the load, as it is one of the types of demand side management (DSM) strategies. A modified algorithm, called elite evolutionary strategy artificial ecosystem-based optimization (EESAEO), is used in scheduling household appliances. The obtained results using the EESAEO algorithm reduce the electricity bill, improve the network, maximize customer comfort and reduce peak formation. The original algorithm is used to compare the simulated results and to verify the strength of the proposed EESAEO algorithm. Different price strategies such as TOU, CPP, and RTP are used, to ensure the efficiency of the studied system. These successful results prove that the applied method can be used for scheduling household appliances.

The primary tasks of these systems are to control, monitor, and optimize the use of energy and flow. Energy is a major resource for all living things and life. Nowadays, electric power plays an important role in powering major infrastructures, human lifestyles, and services. Renewable energy sources such as wind or solar energy, occupy a small percentage of electricity production. Fossil fuels have a strong negative impact on the environment as they cause gas emissions, global warming, and health risks and in addition, it leads to an inevitable drain of resources. These damages have contributed to the awareness of sustainability and energy efficiency, and not only the disclosure of alternative, clean and renewable energy sources [1]. Recently, attention has been paid to reshaping the traditional power grid into a smart grid that is reliable and fully automated. This smart grid seeks to deploy and integrate storage sources and distributed generation. The smart grid consists of two-way communication channels that connect utilities and consumers and smart devices. This facilitates coordination and scheduling of electrical devices in real-time and dynamic optimization of network operation and resources. Reference [2] describes the integration of a dynamic gas model, which replicates instances where gas supply to generators is disrupted, with a power system model that allows for flexible commitment of power plants with fast start-up and shut-down times. The framework's effectiveness is demonstrated through the use of actual electric power and gas systems in various scenarios, such as those involving the penetration of wind and solar power and the analysis of time-varying \u201ccurved flow\u201d gas flows. The issue of improving voltage profiles in distribution networks is covered in Ref. [3]. The process of optimizing voltage was separated into two phases: an offline and an online phase. Afterward, several voltage control zones (VCZs) with pilot nodes (PNs) were formed in the network. The partitioning technique, based on a coordinated method utilizing two different time scales, was then implemented to enhance the voltage profiles of the distribution systems. Reference [4] presents a comprehensive survey of the applications, integration challenges, technical considerations, and potential research areas related to the use of blockchain technology in smart grids. Smart homes contain sensors and digital two-way communication devices, which allow tracking consumer consumption, controlling appliances scheduling, and communicating with utilities and the network. Smart homes are a key element in the operation and effectiveness of the smart grid, and smart homes contribute to raising energy efficiency. As the energy consumption worldwide from buildings is expected to increase dramatically over the next few years. On this trend, reduced energy consumption, waste, efficiency improvements, and environmental risks and costs associated with generation can be implemented from this direction. In the past few years, there has been a growing interest from energy researchers in home energy management systems (HEMS), where HEMS facilitates automatic and intelligent control of smart home appliances. HEMS systems strive for efficient energy management reduce energy consumption, waste, and costs, and help conserve limited fossil fuel resources. HEMS rely on the use of optimization-based techniques. Reference [5] highlights the critical role of implementing an appropriate Home Energy Management System (HEMS) in reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions, thereby enhancing the quality of life for end consumers in smart homes. Reducing billing costs and improving user satisfaction are two essential aspects of HEMS design. While the literature provides comprehensive coverage of the former factor [6\u20138], the latter remains an area for further investigation. The literature extensively covers the first crucial design element of the HEMS, which is to lower billing costs, while neglecting the psychological and behavioral aspects of End-Users' preferences. As for the grid support capabilities [9], proposes an approach that employs an agent-based coordination mechanism in an active distribution network to regulate home appliances and comply with the grid's thermal and voltage limits. Meanwhile [10], presents a HEM strategy that adjusts electricity generation and consumption based on the operating parameters of photovoltaic battery systems and thermostatically controlled loads. The energy consumption of air conditioning systems is initially measured using degree-days, while TCLs are evaluated considering fluctuating indoor temperatures [11]. provides an in-depth analysis of effective power management at home, covering the ideas, technological context, design, infrastructure, plans, objectives, problems, and obstacles that HEMS systems face [12]. offers a comprehensive analysis of the HEMS literature, including key ideas, setups, supporting technologies, and proposed technologies like HCPV and V2H. The suggested strategy schedules the best automation devices to reduce home energy demand and maximize the use of PV energy generation. To regulate domestic and indoor hot water temperature and cut energy use [13], proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm. Refeference [14] proposes a hierarchical energy management system (HEMS) for multiple residential energy hubs in the neighborhood grid, aiming to maximize financial gain and reduce peak upstream grid demand by controlling energy production, storage, procurement, and sale. The lower level of each household energy hub (HEH) supplies internal loads and reduces energy costs, while the central energy management system (CEMS) at the top level brings together local HEHs and makes attractive offers to boost financial gain through a heuristic bidding technique. Zhou et al. [15] have given an overview of concept, configurations, and scheduling strategies of HEMS. Liu et al. [1] have reviewed the main components of smart home energy management systems (SHEMS) and the concept of SHEMS and. They comparatively analyzed the different technological approaches. Zupančič et al. [16] have applied Genetic programming for home energy-management systems to reduce cost. Peacock et al. [17] have used three eco-communities as lead users to carry participatory design exercise. Nizami et al. [9] provided support to the power grid by developing a home energy management system. The proposed system improves the grid voltage level and relieves grid congestion. The proposed system was applied to a dutch low-voltage (LV) residential feeder. Shakeri et al. [18] suggested a smart home equipped with a battery and photovoltaic system to prevent peak formation during daylight hours. The study assumes that the energy consumption of electrical appliances is always below a certain level and allows resident consumers to implement demand response programs independently. The study helped reduce the price of electricity by up to 20% per day while maximizing user convenience. McIlvennie et al. [19] presented a review of the SHEMS literature, and provided an assessment on the discussion of the role of the various components of the SHEMS system in obtaining energy benefits. Lokeshgupta et al. [20] used multipurpose home energy management battery energy storage systems and applied mixed linear programming to the proposed home energy management solution. Six scenarios were hypothesized to ascertain the effects of the battery storage system on the proposed home energy management problem. Achieving the required goals, which are reducing the peak load hour and reducing electricity bills for consumers. In this paper, a modified EESAEO algorithm is used in scheduling household appliances. The proposed EESAEO algorithm features superior performance to obtain global optima. The artificial ecosystem-based optimization (AEO) simulates the ecosystem, ways of obtaining food and relying on each other to obtain food where the stronger organism preys on the weaker organism [21]. The EESAEO algorithm utilizes controlled randomization techniques and maintains abundant population diversity throughout the research process. The inclusion of the elite evolutionary strategy in the AEO algorithm aids in achieving a balance between global search or exploration, ultimately strengthening the proposed EESAEO algorithm's ability to tackle numerous high-dimensional optimization problems. The paper presents several contributions, including proposing a modified EESAEO algorithm to enhance search space exploration and performance. The proposed optimizer is validated using well-known benchmark functions. The study also applies a HEMS system to achieve various goals such as reducing electricity bills, improving the network, maximizing customer comfort, and minimizing peak formation. Finally, the paper uses the original AEO as well as the proposed EESAEO algorithm to schedule household appliances. The remainder of this paper is presented as follows: firstly, defined and characterized of HEMSs, then discuss the description of the problem, then submit the proposed system model, then information and mathematical formulation about the AEO and EESAEO algorithms; then introduced the problem and implementation of the scheduling household appliances. Finally, discuss the results and conclusion. 2 Home energy management systems Smart homes attract the attention of most researchers in the field of energy and it is a big research topic, especially from the point of view of energy efficiency among the different types of buildings. Smart homes have better quality of life and efficiency by implementing remote monitoring and contextual self-adaptation, as well as for device scheduling. Genetic algorithm (GA) is used to solve nonlinear problems, so it is applied to solve an optimization problem. To automatically schedule all devices in the optimal way it applies real time price (RTP) and inclining block rates (IBR) pricing strategies. A modified EESAEO algorithm is proposed to achieve the best results to efficiently exploit the search space. 3 Problem description At smart grid (SG), maximizing consumer satisfaction levels, minimizing energy costs and minimizing peak to average ratio (PAR) are key challenging tasks. However, in some literature, consumer satisfaction is diminished in order to reduce PAR and reduce the cost of electricity consumption. In the past years, several strategies have been proposed to deal with the above problems. GA is used to solve nonlinear problems, so it is used to solve an optimization problem. The RTP, CPP and TOU tariff charts are used to schedule all electrical appliances in the optimum manner. It achieves effective results in reducing PAR and the cost of electricity consumption. However, there is no style in their scheduling method to facilitate consumer priorities. References [22] explores a reinforcement learning algorithm for managing household electric appliances with the objective of reducing energy consumption through optimal use of renewable energy sources, while also increasing financial gain using a heuristic bidding approach. Meanwhile, Tuomela et al. [23] studied the changes in electricity consumption, daily consumption patterns, and the frequency of high and low consumption hours in ten Finnish households after installing HEMS. These changes were analyzed based on each household's energy values, which were obtained through semi-structured interviews. Ma et al. in Ref. [24] formulated the energy scheduling problem as an optimization problem. Ma assumes two types of consumer electrical appliances, one characterized as constantly operating at constant power with flexible start-up time, and is the first type of appliance. The second type operates at a predetermined working time with flexible power. Ma et al. achieved satisfactory results for both consumer convenience and energy cost. One of the drawbacks of this paper is that it has a very high computational time and complexity. Marzband et al. [25] introduced a new algorithm called multi-layer ant colony optimization (MACO) for scheduling to EMS in Micro-grid (MG). The results obtained using MACO were compared with modified conventional energy management system (MCEMS) and PSO-based EMS. The results showed the superiority of MACO over other algorithms. The system proposed by Marzband et al. achieved a decrease in Energy consumption cost, compared to PSO and MCEMS. However, it does not take into account the level of user satisfaction. Hong et al. in Ref. [26] suggested a method for load allocation. This method allocates electricity sources based on demand, priority, equity, and price. Devices with higher priority operate without disconnection even at high price hours. Energy sources are allocated to a large number of devices that operate at low price hours. The installation and maintenance costs of the energy storage systems (ESS) are negligible and not taken into account. So ESS is used to store energy during low price hours. To solve the optimization problems, many common algorithms were used in the literature such as bacterial foraging approach (BFA), GA, particle swarm optimization (PSO), sine cosine algorithm (SCA), and human serum albumin (HAS). But in this paper, a modification of the AEO algorithm is proposed and applied to manage the demand of load and compare it with the original algorithm. 4 Studied system model In this paper, the main problems faced by the electricity consumer are addressed, which is the problem of the cost of the electricity bill and reducing the PAR, taking into account the convenience of the consumer. Fig. 1 shows the proposed system model for this study [39]. The figure shows the components of the smart grid in terms of residential area, generation unit and transmission line. A home based on the Internet of things with a number of electrical appliances is considered a smart home in the residential area. Users set the values of power rating (PR) and length of operation time (LoT) for devices. The central unit used to store information. Two-way communication is used to provide communication between EMC, smart meter, and devices. EMC is included with a scheduler that schedules devices according to user LoT. Zwave, wifi and Zigbee have been widely adopted at smart home for cost effective connectivity. In this study, coordination between electrical devices in smart homes is applied. With system flexibility by integrating real-time demand. In this proposed study, the proposed system is flexible as it accepts sudden changes from the consumer. The scheduler shuts down a device, and produces an empty slot used to run priority devices at runtime by coordinating between devices to exploit that empty slot. In this study, in order to apply the coordination at runtime, the problem is solved as the backpack problem. The capacity of the backpack represents the empty slot limit. This allows consumers to tailor the schedule according to their needs and priorities for the range of devices. It allows the consumer to change devices at runtime according to their needs. The scheduler creates a new schedule for devices containing the user's preferred devices, without exposure to the load profile of other devices whenever an interruption is created in the schedule. The operating time of these favorite devices does not require a full time period of 1 h but in minutes. When a user sends an interrupt to operate an electrical appliance, the scheduler seeks to stop all scheduling operations and ensure that the devices that can do the interrupt are running in that specified time period in which the interrupt is created. Quickly, when an interruptible electrical device is getting turned on, the operations of that particular uninterruptible device are disconnected as that device is no longer desired. The scheduler allocates the remaining time to the preferred electrical appliances, and the remaining time is calculated in that specified time period. This can increase the comfort level of the user due to effective load management. DP is used to solve decision making problems so it is used for complex scheduling based on backpack problem. 5 Scenarios Suppose that it is a smart house that includes 9 electrical appliances. The user creates a priority device interrupt and scheduled reviews to turn the interruptible devices on and off at that specified hour and allocate the remaining time period for the emergency devices. The backpack problem is applied to solve the rescheduling problem between electrical devices, the capacity of the backpack is the time remaining after the interruption occurs, the weight of the backpack is the working time of the device and the value of the backpack problem is the cost of the device. This study focuses on managing energy consumption efficiently over a 24-h period to reduce the cost of electricity consumption and reduce PAR. DSM controls demand and manages power. DSM controls the demand-side of end users and manages energy consumption. Energy management motivates consumers to shift their loads from peak hours and motivate them to use energy outside of peak hours. Shifting load to off-peak hours enables users to reduce the cost of electricity consumption, with a trade-off for their convenience. As a result, network operations are efficient and reliable. Various pricing strategies have been implemented such as CPP, TOU, and RTP. 6 Proposed scheme In the previous literature, different types of optimization algorithms have been applied, which differ in terms of problem solving depending on network and consumer requirements. Among the most widely used algorithms to solve the scheduling problem in SG are BFA, PSO, GA, HSA and others. Chen et al. presented a new approach, a mixture of GA and BFA, characterized by excellent local research capabilities [27]. Jiao et al. in Ref. [28] presented a modification to HSA characterized by effectiveness globally the research space. Thus, the concept of barter appears in the exploration of the search space now, and the need to focus on the exploration and exploitation of parallel search spaces appears. The EESAEO approach is proposed to implement the studied system based on performance criteria to obtain scheduling benefits. 7 Artificial ecosystem-based optimization The Artificial Ecosystem-Based Optimization (AEO) was introduced in 2019 by Zhao et al. [29]. The AEO simulates three unique behaviors of living organisms: decomposer, consumption, and production. Producers are any type of green plant that does not depend on living organisms, and most producers provide their food directly from the sun, water, and air. Consumers are birds or animals that cannot process their own food, but consumers eat other consumers or producers for their own food. Decomposers are organisms that obtain their food from organisms' waste, or consumers (animals), or producers (dead plants). Fig. 2 show the ecosystem and energy flow. To apply an ecosystem in an AEO all populations are arranged in descending order of job suitability value. Fig. 3 shows the AEO and the red arrows are the direction of the energy flow. The lowest function fitness value is best individual and the highest function fitness value is worst individual. Producer is worst individual and decomposer is best individual. 7.1 Production Sunlight, air, water is used to produce food for the product. The worst individual (producer) in a population seeks to be updated by the best individual (the decomposer) and upper and the low limits of search. This modified individual will indicate the remaining individuals in the population search for different regions. The production process is formulated as follows: (1) X 1 ( t + 1 ) = ( 1 − b ) X n u m ( t ) + b X r a n d ( t ) (2) X r a n d = s ( max − min ) + L (3) b = s 1 1 − t MAX i t e r where n u m is the number of size population, max and min are the maximum and minimum limits, respectively, MAX i t e r is the maximal number of iterations, s 1 is a random number between [0, 1], X r a n d the random position of the individual, b is a coefficient of linear weight. 7.2 Consumption After the production process is completed, the consumption process comes, where each consumer feeds on fewer consumers or producer or both. The consumption process can be represented mathematically as follows: (4) C = 1 2 v 1 | v 2 | (5) v 1 ≈ N ( 0,1 ) , v 2 ≈ N ( 0,1 ) , If the consumer is a herbivore, he only eats the product. It can be formulated mathematically as follows: (6) X i ( t + 1 ) = X i ( t ) + C . ( X i ( t ) − X 1 ( t ) ) , i ε ( 2 , \u2026 \u2026 . . n u m ) If the consumer of the carnivore feeds on a consumer less than him in energy, it can be formulated mathematically as follows: (7) { X i ( t + 1 ) = X i ( t ) + C . ( X i ( t ) − X j ( t ) ) , i ε ( 3 , \u2026 \u2026 . . n u m ) j = r a n d i ( [ 2 i − 1 ] ) If the consumer feeds on both, a consumer of less energy or a product can be formulated mathematically as follows: (8) { X i ( t + 1 ) = X i ( t ) + C . ( s 2 ( X i ( t ) − X 1 ( t ) ) ) + ( 1 − s 2 ) ( X i ( t ) − X j ( t ) ) , i ε ( 3 , \u2026 \u2026 . . n u m ) j = r a n d i ( [ 2 i − 1 ] ) 7.3 Decomposition Decomposition is a necessary process in an ecosystem due to the dependence of product growth on the nutrients resulting from decomposition. It can be formulated mathematically as follows: (9) X i ( t + 1 ) = X n ( t ) + D . ( e . X n ( t ) − h . X n ( t ) ) , i ε ( 1 , \u2026 \u2026 . . n u m ) where D is the factor of decomposition, e and h are the coefficients of weight. Hence, the decomposition X n is used to update the position of an individual's X i by parameters D, e and h in a population. (10) D = 3 u , u ≈ N ( 0,1 ) , (11) e = r 3 . r a n d i ( [ 1 2 ] ) − 1 (12) h = 2 . r 3 − 1 8 Elite evolutionary strategy artificial ecosystem-based optimization The conventional AEO algorithm suffers from the local minima when handling non-linear objective functions. Also, the convergence rapidity and accuracy are low because of the randomness. To overcome all those drawbacks and develop the solution effectiveness as well as the rate of convergence. In addition, to improve the strength of the proposed EESAEO technique for numerous high-dimensional optimization problems, the way is utilization from an elite evolutionary strategy (EES) based on evolution-based meta-heuristic algorithms [30]. It is integrated the EES into the exploitation phase of AEO algorithm to propose an enhanced meta-heuristic algorithm referred to as EESAEO. 8.1 Elite evolution strategy This strategy includes two different methods: elite natural evolution and elite random mutation. 8.2 Elite natural evolution The core principles of Elite natural evolution are gene crossing and gene mutation. The mathematical description of the elite natural evolution is as follows: (13) N 1 = ( 50 % ⊗ E 2 ) ⊗ ( 50 % ⊗ E 3 ) (14) N 2 = [ 100 ( 1 − s p ) % ⊗ E 1 ] ⊗ [ ( 100 s p ) % ⊗ N 1 ] (15) s p = r a n d ( − 1,1 ) × ( 1 − t T ) (16) X \u2032 = N 2 + G V | N 2 − X | 8.3 Elite random mutation The purpose of elite random mutation is to mutate some genes of elite chromosomes within the search scope and provide stronger exploration ability for the algorithm in the later stage of evolution to improve the ability to jump out of local optimum. (17) R 1 = C L + ( G S n u m ) | C L − E 1 | (18) X \u2032 = [ 100 ( 1 − s p ) % ⊗ E 1 ] ⊗ [ ( 100 s p ) % ⊗ R 1 ] The flow chart of the EESAEO technique is presented in Fig. 4 . 9 Problem formulation The studied HEMS study works on operating loads and scheduling electrical devices in two periods, the first period scheduling on the next day and the second period scheduling at the present time. This paper is concerned with several important objectives, including reducing the electricity cost bill, reducing the difference between the objective load curve and actual energy consumption and reducing PAR. 10 Load shifting The first objective of the study is to reduce the difference between the objective load curves and load the consumption schedule using the modified algorithm for the ecosystem. The first objective can be represented mathematically as follows [39]: (19) O 1 = min ( E l o a d s c h h o u r − o b j l c u r v e h o u r ) where o b j l c u r v e h o u r is the objective load curve. It can be represented mathematically as follows: (20) o b j l c u r v e h o u r ∝ 1 E p r i c e s c h h o u r The o b j l c u r v e h o u r is inversely proportional to the E p r i c e s c h h o u r , the hourly price is formulated as: (21) E l o a d = ∑ d = 1 M A p p p r a t e d × ϖ ϖ It is the state of the electrical device if it is on or off 1, 0 respectively. The objective load curve has constraints and these constraints can be formulated as follows: (22) F P O P = { E l o a d i ∈ P O P ≥ P l 1 i f H p o f f E l o a d i ∈ P O P > P l 2 ˄ E l o a d i ∈ P O P < P l 3 , i f H p o n (23) P l 1 = s u m ( l o a d N h ) − s t d ( E l o a d u n s c h ) (24) P l 2 = s t d ( E l o a d u n s c h ) + ¥ × min ( E l o a d u n s c h ) (25) P l 3 = m e a n ( E l o a d u n s c h ) (26) l o a d N h = E l o a d u n s c h ( h ) − min \u2061 ( E l o a d u n s c h ) max ( E l o a d u n s c h ) − min \u2061 ( E l o a d u n s c h ) (27) F f = min \u2061 ( F P O P ) Where is P l 2 is the on-peak power limit, P l 1 is the off-peak power limit, ¥ is set such that the minimum off-peak hours load is higher than the minimum on-peak hours. These constraints enable obtaining the optimal solution from a file Search space, F f gets the most suitable person from the given Population (PoP), to avoid peak formation during peak hours. 11 Electricity cost bill minimization Reducing the electricity cost bill is the second goal, and it can be formulated mathematically as follows [39]: (28) O 2 = min ( E c o s t t o t a l ) (29) E c o s t t o t a l = ∑ h o u r = 1 24 E c o s t h o u r (30) E c o s t h o u r = ∑ d = 1 M E p r i c e h o u r × A p p p r a t e d × φ 12 User comfort maximization The user comfort maximization is the third objective. Customers need flexibility in scheduling electrical appliances, as the user can switch between electrical appliances and turn an appliance on or off based on their needs. When the user requests to turn on a specific device, rescheduling reduces the waiting time for the user. This paper is concerned with maximizing user comfort, which can be mathematically formulated as: (31) O 3 = max ( c o m f o r t ) (32) A p p α = { 1 ; i f 1 ˆ 0 ; o t h e r w i s e (33) c o m f o r t ∝ 1 A p p w t d (34) A p p w t d = min | A p p D h d − A p p S h d | 13 PAR reduction The main objective of this study is to maintain network stability by reducing PAR. It can be formulated mathematically as [31]: (35) O 4 = min ( P A R ) (36) P A R = max ( ( E l o a d s c h N ) ) 2 ( a v g ( E l o a d s c h N ) ) 2 (37) E l o a d s c h N = { E l o a d s c h 1 , E l o a d s c h 2 , E l o a d s c h 3 , \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 E l o a d s c h 24 } E l o a d s c h N is the scheduled electricity load per calculated hour. The proposed HEMS paradigm comprises two components, namely, day-ahead scheduling and real-time rescheduling, which aim to achieve the goals of reducing electricity costs, PAR, and enhancing user comfort. However, there exists a trade-off between these performance objectives as they are interdependent. To address this issue, a multi-objective optimization approach with constraints was adopted for day-ahead scheduling to minimize the trade-off between electricity prices and PAR, as described by Equation (22). On the other hand, objective was considered for real-time rescheduling. The weighted sum multi-objective optimization method was utilized to minimize the trade-off, and its mathematical expression is as follows: (38) O 1 * λ + ( 1 − λ ) * O 3 Where λ = 1 demonstrates that the user's comfort is disregarded during day-ahead scheduling. 14 Simulation results and discussion 14.1 Validation of the proposed algorithm using benchmark function This subsection presents a comparison between the proposed EESAEO technique and several recent algorithms using seven benchmark functions to demonstrate its superiority. All experiments were conducted on MATLAB (R2016a) using a computer with an Intel(R) Core i5-4210U CPU 2.40 GHz and 8 GB RAM. The maximum number of iterations for all techniques was set to 200, and the number of populations was 50. The EESAEO technique's performance was evaluated by comparing its mean value and standard deviation (STD) with those of conventional AEO, SDO [32], INFO [33], and artificial rabbits optimization (ARO) [34]. Table 1 shows the statistical results of the mean value and STD. The EESAEO algorithm outperformed the compared algorithms in five benchmark functions (F1, F2, F3, F4, F7) in terms of average value, demonstrating its effectiveness in solving real-world optimization problems. Moreover, AEO and INFO ranked second and third-best, respectively, displaying strong efficiency. Fig. 5 presents the convergence curves of each algorithm for the seven benchmark functions. Each benchmark function was implemented over 20 independent trails. The EESAEO technique showed much better convergence capability than the original AEO, SDO, INFO, and ARO algorithms. This fast convergence capability makes the EESAEO algorithm a promising technique to solve real-world optimization problems. To further investigate the attained results, boxplots for the seven benchmark functions are presented in Fig. 6 . The narrow boxplots of the proposed EESAEO technique for most functions indicate good consistency in terms of median, maximum, and minimum values. 14.2 The studied system The MATLAB program is used to perform simulations on the studied system and verify the system's performance. The studied system was applied to three different price signals, namely RTP, TOU, and CPP to verify the validity of the studied system. The results were performed using the modified ecosystem artificial optimization before and after coordination. Moreover, the results are compared with the original ecosystem artificial optimization. This studied system assumes a single smart home that includes nine electrical appliances. These devices are divided into three types: category A, category B, and category C. Table 2 shows the three categories of electrical appliances, their daily usage rate, and hourly energy consumption. 15 Price tariff Smart pricing is an alternative to the old fixed electricity prices. The price tariff program allows consumers to have various prices for electricity at various times. Consumers consume less electricity when electricity prices are high, according to the different electricity prices, which lead to a reduction in demand during peak hours. 15.1 Time of use (TOU) This pricing charges consumers with different electricity prices according to different time periods [35]. TOU pricing divides time into three categories (off-peak, mid peak, and on-peak). The price of electricity in the off-peak period is much lower than its price in the mid-peak and on-peak periods, in order to encourage users to shift their loads into off-peak. Pricing tranches are issued long in advance, it remains unchanged for a long time. 15.2 Critical peak pricing (CPP) CPP is applied for a limited number of hours or a certain period of time per year, in order to balance demand with supply or the reliability of the system [36]. The main price of this pricing is TOU pricing except for a certain period, the normal peak price is raised to reduce users' energy demand. 15.3 Real-time pricing (RTP) This pricing is called dynamic pricing, where the price of electricity in time periods varies according to different time periods of the day every 15 min or every hour [35]. RTP is used on an hourly or next day basis. RTP is considered to be the most efficient and economical software [37]. Simulation results are explained in two subcategories: Scheduling before and after coordination and its impact on electricity cost and PAR. 16 Scheduling before coordination The three different prices: RTP, TOU and CPP were used to test the studied system. The total unscheduled cost of electricity is high for all three tariffs Fig. 15 shows the total unscheduled cost of electricity. In Fig. 15, the value of RTP, TOU and CPP are 1849, 1805, and 7199 cents, respectively. Figs. 7, 9, 11, 13 and 15 show the simulation results for three tariffs before coordination. The electrical load before using EESAEO and AEO during a day is shown in Fig. 7. Fig. 7 shows the effect of EESAEO used to transfer the load, which directly affects the cost. The load curve scheduling using EESAEO is very similar to the objective load curve. In high peak hours EESAEO gives low price signals. Hourly electricity cost for unscheduled, AEO and EESAEO is shown in Fig. 9. Because the load is shifted out of peak hours without peak formation, the cost during peak hours for an unscheduled pregnancy is high compared to a scheduled pregnancy. Here comes the concept of trade-off and how to choose between cost and PAR. Table 3 shows the trade-off between cost and PAR for each EESAEO and AEO. The EESAEO algorithm demonstrates superior performance compared to AEO in terms of reducing peak-to-average ratio (PAR) and cost in various tariff structures, as shown in Figs. 13 and 15. For example, in the CPP tariff structure, EESAEO achieves a minimum PAR of 2.1, which is 58% less than unscheduled PAR, while reducing cost by 39%. Additionally, EESAEO outperforms AEO in terms of waiting time, as shown in Fig. 11(c). In the TOU tariff structure, EESAEO reduces PAR and cost by 47% and 39%, respectively, outperforming AEO. In the RTP tariff structure, EESAEO reduces PAR by 60% and cost by 14%, further demonstrating its superior performance compared to AEO. Overall, the results indicate that EESAEO is a promising algorithm for optimizing scheduling in different tariff structures. . 17 Scheduling after coordination Coordination does not affect the correlation between the load curves scheduled using EESAEO and AEO and the objective load curve as shown in Fig. 8. During peak hours, the cost of electricity is relatively high, as shown in Fig. 10. During peak hours for all different prices the cost of electricity is high. The moving load outside the peak hours of one house on the electrical network is illustrated in Fig. 8. Table 4 shows the trade-off between cost and PAR for each EESAEO and AEO after coordination. Fig. 16 shows the total cost of all the different tariffs and their impact on the moving load from peak to off-peak hours, and that the total cost decreases with coordination between devices. Fig. 14 shows the PAR of all the different tariffs and their effect on the moving load from peak to off-peak hours, and that PAR increases with coordination between devices. Fig. 16 illustrates that using RTP, there is a significant reduction in expenses for both EESAEO and AEO, with EESAEO resulting in a 13% reduction and AEO resulting in an 8% reduction. The graphs also clearly show the contrast between the pre-coordination and post-coordination periods, indicating a decrease in total load demand and an increase in peak load during coordination. The coordination reduces the load, leading to cost savings, but it may increase the PAR as occasionally large load appliances are passed, highlighting the tradeoff between cost and PAR. The waiting times of appliances are shown in Figs. 11 and 12 , where it is expected that the waiting times will be shorter after coordination compared to before. As called appliances are considered interruptible loads and their waiting time is treated as zero, this effect can be easily observed for interruptible loads. . 18 Discussion The results of the study indicate that employing a dined approach not only reduces the cost of electricity but also lowers PAR during day-ahead scheduling, thereby minimizing the need for real-time rescheduling. However, the findings also reveal that there is a trade-off between several performance measures, including PAR, comfort, and electricity cost. The proposed algorithm allows for coordination between devices to enhance user satisfaction, but this has an impact on PAR and cost, as demonstrated in Tables 3 and 4 Table 5 shows the lower and upper endpoints for an average of 20 iterations, with EESAEO exhibiting a 6% lower percentage difference between lower and upper cost and only 42% for PAR using RTP. Table 6 illustrates the impact of coordination on waiting times, PAR, and electricity costs. The results demonstrate how cooperation reduces waiting times and electricity costs while increasing PAR. The simulation results reveal that EESAEO outperforms AEO, as there is no significant difference for any pricing schemes. 19 Conclusion Most of the electricity consumption in the world falls in the residential sector as a result of the tremendous progress in the electrical appliance industry. This work is concerned with rationalizing energy consumption in the residential sector, and the concept of load transfer has been applied to achieve the desired goals. The HEMS system was implemented for scheduling electrical devices in order to achieve multiple goals using the modified algorithm for the ecological system. This paper proposes a novel optimization algorithm called EESAEO, which incorporates the elite evolutionary strategy to obtain feasible optimal solutions for the scheduling of electrical devices, while considering system constraints. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated using established benchmark functions. The results show that EESAEO outperforms or performs similarly to AEO, SDO, INFO, and ARO, thus validating the effectiveness of this innovative optimization technique. The studied system is characterized by flexibility as it enables the user to request the operation of a particular device and to turn off another device, which is called re-scheduling or scheduling at the present time, so it uses the coordination between devices with dynamic scheduling. Various price strategies are used such as TOU, CPP and RTP to evaluate the performance of the HEMS system. Electricity cost and peak to average ratio are not significantly affected during rescheduling and this is evident in the results. Moreover, the results of the modified algorithm are compared with the original algorithm to verify the accuracy of the modified algorithm and its efficiency in the studied system. The simulation results show that the cost of electrical and peak to average ratio decreased by up to 50% and 40%, respectively. Moreover, to check the performance and efficiency of the HEMS system, different price strategies RTP, TOU and CPP are analyzed. The results obtained from the EESAEO algorithm suggest its potential application in solving complex optimization problems in power systems, including single and multi-objective problems such as energy management, smart grid systems incorporating renewable energy resources and a large fleet of electrical vehicles, and smart homes. In the future, the algorithm could be expanded to encompass additional application examples, such as increasing the number or power ratings of home appliances and modifying time slots. The proposed algorithm may also be utilized in the context of consumer-owned microgrids that are connected to the larger power grid for electricity generation.

        "dc:description": "In recent times, the tremendous progress in electronic devices and making them available to all consumers has led to an increase in demand for energy, the formation of a peak, and an increase in the electricity bill of the consumer. Buildings are considered one of the main sectors of energy consumption. Improving the energy efficiency of these buildings will achieve economic and environmental goals. This paper proposes a modified algorithm for scheduling electrical appliances in the smart home to reduce the electricity bill, improve the network, maximize customer comfort and reduce peak formation. This paper uses load conversion to change the shape of the load, as it is one of the types of demand side management (DSM) strategies. A modified algorithm, called elite evolutionary strategy artificial ecosystem-based optimization (EESAEO), is used in scheduling household appliances. The obtained results using the EESAEO algorithm reduce the electricity bill, improve the network, maximize customer comfort and reduce peak formation. The original algorithm is used to compare the simulated results and to verify the strength of the proposed EESAEO algorithm. Different price strategies such as TOU, CPP, and RTP are used, to ensure the efficiency of the studied system. These successful results prove that the applied method can be used for scheduling household appliances.",
