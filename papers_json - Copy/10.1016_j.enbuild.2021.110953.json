Detecting deficiencies using building performance data in healthcare facilities: Improving operational efficiency with Continuous Commissioning ® Amin Isazadeh \u204e Rajeev Kamal \u204e Carlos Yagua Sebastian Eluvathingal David E. Claridge Energy Systems Laboratory, Texas A&M Engineering Experiment Station, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX 77840, USA Energy Systems Laboratory Texas A&M Engineering Experiment Station Texas A&M University College Station TX 77840 USA Energy Systems Laboratory, Texas A&M Engineering Experiment Station, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX 77840, USA \u204e Corresponding authors. The Continuous Commissioning® version of the Existing Building Commissioning process was implemented in three large hospitals and optimized the HVAC operations to improve their energy use while maintaining comfort without any capital system investment. In the hospitals studied, measures accounting for 64% of the total annual commissioning cost savings of $592,816 were identified by analyzing trend data. Trend analysis of AHU ON/OFF status, economizer, outside air damper position, supply air temperature, and supply air static pressure corresponded to 51%, 8%, 5%, 31%, and 4% of the total projected savings, respectively. The use of trend analysis identified measures in the three case-study hospitals that are projected to reduce the EUI of the three hospitals by 16%, 21% and 19% respectively, even though the average consumption of the three hospitals was below the 5th percentile of hospital consumption. The availability and use of trend data in these facilities saved time in identifying these operational improvements and likely identified some improvements that would not have been identified using manual diagnostic techniques. Continuous engagement of this low cost and resource-intensive analysis tool can significantly reduce the operational costs for facilities. Keywords Continuous Commissioning® Building efficiency Trend data analysis Fault detection and diagnosis Energy cost reduction measures 1 Introduction The Existing Building Commissioning Process (EBCx) has emerged over the last three decades as a highly cost-effective way to reduce energy use in large buildings \u2013 often by 10% − 20%. [1,2]. The process has been documented and a recent survey showed it is being widely implemented generating engineering revenue of at least $260 M/yr [3]. ASHRAE has developed Guideline 0.2 Commissioning Process for Existing Systems and Assemblies [4] and Guideline 1.2 Technical Requirements for The Commissioning Process for Existing HVAC&R Systems and Assemblies [5] that describe the process in detail. Historically, the process has utilized analysis of energy consumption data coupled with an on-site assessment and a detailed investigation where the EBCx team worked with the building operating staff to examine EMCS screens and conduct measurements throughout the HVAC systems to identify opportunities to improve the control algorithms used to control the systems and to identify and repair faulty components that compromise efficiency, often without compromising comfort. This was largely a manual process coupled with a simulation of proposed changes to achieve practical optimization of energy use. Over the last decade, the role of data analysis and the use of computational algorithms in the operation and control of building HVAC systems has improved significantly. Building automation systems (BAS)as computer-based technology emerged in the 1980s [6]. This technology has been developed many times in tandem with the widespread adoption of information systems across all industries. They mainly focus on control, automation and optimization of HVAC systems. Over the last decade, such systems became more distributed and more accessible. The BAS\u2019 ability to trending HVAC systems operation is one of the most valuable features that can be utilized to monitor the functionality of the system to discover possible system failure and accurately diagnose problems [7]. In recent years, scholars have enhanced the capability of such building energy management systems (BEMS) by incorporating machine learning techniques to occupant behavior and optimally control the integrated systems [8]; another study obtained 20% savings by combining Internet of Things technology and a decentralized control strategy with a legacy BAS [9]. Moreover, fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) strategies have been used to identify potential system failure. One study automated fault detection and diagnosis by manipulating temperature and flow sensor readings to address VAV-terminal box issues [10]. Another defined four featured parameters and control limits for chiller operation and identified seven types of faulty chiller operation [11]. The use of automation and analysis can help reduce the effort that goes into the manual commissioning process as the interaction of thousands of sensors, components, dampers, valves, pumps, VFDs of an HVAC system, fire and plumbing system needed to be studied, analyzed and balanced. In an ideal situation, automatic fault detection and diagnostics will provide continuous awareness of the system operation and intervention required to maintain optimum operation [12,13]. Based on the Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey [14], food service and health care (hospitals) are the most energy-intensive facilities in the commercial buildings sector. The use of an extensive variety of specialized and energy-intensive medical equipment is the main reason for the high energy intensity of hospitals. Siano et. al. [15] claimed that their energy consumption profile can be modified by incorporating a Distribution Locational Marginal Price (D-LMPs) strategy. In the present study, the Continuous Commissioning® (CC) 1 1 Continuous Commissioning and CC are registered trademarks of the Texas A&M Engineering Experiment Station version of the EBCx process has been implemented at three Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAMCs) in Salem, VA, Durham, NC, and Fayetteville, NC, covering over 1.7 million square feet of conditioned space. Measures were implemented and tuned to accommodate specific existing conditions or HVAC configurations to improve comfort while reducing overall energy costs. These energy reduction measures are expected to save 9% of electricity use (5,783 MWh/yr) and 27% of natural gas use (75,518 MMBtu). The energy savings will produce cost savings of $592,816 ($0.33/sq. ft.) per year, which are 15% of the total energy costs. This paper summarizes the deficiencies and the EBCx opportunities identified by analyzing the BAS trend data. The schematic diagram of the data analysis process done in this study is shown in Fig. 1 . The Energy Use Index (EUI) for each of these hospitals before implementation of the EBCx process was 149, 161 and 253 kBtu/(ft2-yr) for Fayetteville, Salem and Durham respectively which is far below the Energy Star Portfolio Manager median of 467 kBtu/(ft2-yr) for hospitals, and brackets the 5th percentile value of 211 kBtu/(ft2-yr) [16]. 2 Use of trend data in the CC process Data management systems have been developed to gather and analyze building information to monitor building operations and achieve a higher level of performance with lower energy consumption while assuring tenant comfort. These include the Data Warehouse developed by Ahmed et. al. [17] to facilitate storing multidimensional data for further investigation and the Automated Building Commissioning Analysis Tool developed by Bynum et. al. [18]. Other work has focused on developing an efficient fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) process to identify system faults by analyzing suspicious symptoms and performing data manipulations. A system-level FDD algorithm was proposed by Wu et. al. [19] in which a principal component analysis (PCA) projects a three-dimensional trend on a two-dimensional domain. A statistical correlation analysis is then used to identify abnormal energy consumption. In this paper, seven different types of trend data were utilized to identify or confirm the value of commissioning measures and/or to verify the successful implementation of these measures as follows: i. Air Handling Unit ON/OFF Status: to find the units running during unoccupied hours. ii. Economizer: to determine inappropriate economizer settings that lead to no outside air damper modulation. iii. Outside Air Damper Position: to discover units with high minimum outside air intake compared to ASHRAE Standard 170 [20] for health care facilities. iv. Supply Air Temperature: to see if there is any potential for a reset schedule to reduce simultaneous heating and cooling. v. Chilled Water and Hot Water Valve Positions: to spot hunting valves. vi. Supply Fan Speed: to check proper control of fans and fan response. vii. Supply Air Static Pressure: to discover potential for reset schedules to reduce fan power. The use of each of these trends is discussed with specific examples. 2.1 AHU ON/OFF status This trend indicates whether the unit is switched OFF or on. It is useful for identifying the application of an operational schedule on the unit, and whether the unit is working within or outside its intended running hours. There are times when units do not follow their intended operating schedule. Control overrides by the operators often causes such discrepancies. Claridge et al. [21] reported that identifying the operational status of a medical research facility\u2018s AHUs led to $143,053/yr (38% of total saving) of savings from optimizing schedules (including operational schedules and hot/cold deck reset schedules). One of the studied units is a 100% outside air single duct constant air volume (AHU-2H2 located in Building 143, VA Salem) with preheating coil, cooling coil, reheating coil, supply fan, and humidifier in the supply duct and energy recovery coil and exhaust fan in the exhaust duct that provides 2430 CFM flow. The supply air temperature and humidity are being controlled by the coils and the humidifier, respectively, in which the humidifier valve modulate based on minimum output of the two separate reverse-acting 2 2 Reverse-acting PID loop is a PID loop whose output tends to decrease as the measured process variable increases. PID loops; the measured relative humidity as the process variable and supply air humidity setpoint (45%) and return air humidity setpoint (60%) as the setpoints of the PID loops against which the process variable is compared. The cooling coil valve and the reheating coil valve modulate based on a single direct-acting 3 3 Direct-acting PID loop is a PID loop whose output tends to increase as the measured process variable increases. PID loop in which the measured supply air temperature is the process variable compared against a set point. The preheating coil valve has its own reverse acting PID loop with 55°F as the setpoint. This unit serves 8,100 ft2 of space (0.3 CFM/ft2) and was always ON even during unoccupied hours. The unit\u2018s operational schedule was changed to be ON during the occupied hours of 3 AM to 6 PM and OFF from 6 PM to 3 AM and all day on Sunday. The expected savings are $6,100 annually. These savings (and savings from all other measures described in this paper) were determined by modeling the performance of the building with and without these measures implemented using an internal program that is based on the ASHRAE Simplified Energy Analysis Procedure [22]. This program has been shown to provide close estimates of the savings from commissioning measures in projects implemented by the authors\u2019 laboratory for over 10 years. This includes 81,483 kWh and 1,008 MMBtu reductions in electricity and natural gas consumption, respectively. The system status before and after implementation is shown in Fig. 2 which clearly shows the unit has been ON continuously from Jan. 29, 2019 to Feb. 8, 2019 (before the measure implementation), while it is OFF for nine hours each day from 6 PM till 3 AM and on Sundays subsequently. As a clarification, the OFF status on the graph represents when the system is completely shut down including supply of chilled water and steam, not just the fans. The valves (at the unit level) will be automatically commanded to closed position, when the Building Automation System commands the system OFF and follows a set of OFF commands to valves, fans and actuators. Analysis of the operational schedule trend data in three Veterans Affairs Medical Centers identified projected schedule savings of $193,620/yr including savings of 1,821,799 kWh/yr of electricity and 30,577 MMBtu/yr of natural gas as shown in Table 1 per conditioned area of the facility. 2.2 Economizer An economizer enables HVAC systems to take advantage of free cooling when the outside air temperature is suitable. Such systems often provide all cooling during cool weather. The use of a hybrid mechanical cooling and natural ventilation system saved 2.32 kWh/ft2 one case [23]. ASHRAE Standard 62.1 defines minimum ventilation requirements according to zone functionality. The outside air volume is controlled by the outside air damper position. Reinhard [24] proposed the use of a simple offset algorithm for economizer control and specified three conditions for proper economizer operation where, \u2022 the outside air (OA) damper should be open when the outside air temperature (OAT) is between the maximum economizer operation temperature and the supply air temperature setpoint (SATSP), \u2022 the OA damper should modulate so the mixed air temperature (MAT) will be maintained at the supply air temperature setpoint when the OAT is lower than the SATSP, \u2022 and finally, the OA damper should be at its minimum position when the OAT is higher than the RAT. Each condition specifies a virtual setpoint for the MAT that allows a comparison with the measured MAT. There are several types of economizers according to their controlling logic. The most common economizer is based on fixed-OAT. This economizer just looks at the OA dry-bulb temperature and modulates the OA damper as described above. Some economizers control the OA damper position based on OA enthalpy. There are three common issues associated with outside air control, as listed below: i. High minimum OA intake: many units provide more OA than required based on the appropriate ventilation standard due to an improper damper setting or damper degradation. For instance, a single duct constant air volume unit in VA Salem was intaking an excessive amount of outside air based on the site assessment. To reduce the OA intake, the minimum OA damper position was accordingly reduced. ii. Enthalpy-based economizer: such an economizer operates based on the humidity sensor reading. Humidity sensors are notoriously difficult to maintain and often become saturated. This will prevent the economizer from operating. iii. Moreover, having a faulty sensor may lead to excessive energy usage. Such a problem was studied by Zhang et. al. [25] where they quantified the impact of erroneous OAT reading on cooling coil energy consumption at different site locations. iv. Economizer with an improper range of operation: economizer acts on the OA damper based on the outside air temperature. As noted earlier, there is a range of OAT where the OA damper can be fully open to reduce the load on the cooling coil. Such a range of operation should be wisely set to avoid excessive energy consumption. The minimum of this range may be set to the cooling coil leaving air setpoint and the maximum of the range should be less than the return air temperature. For example, a single-zone constant air volume unit with a capacity of 5,140 [CFM] and a supply fan with 7.5 [HP] serving a dishwashing area of a kitchen (AHU-1 located in Building 4, VA Salem) was detected to have an abnormal economizer setting. The unit has heating coil, cooling coil, and supply fan in the supply duct and return fan in the return duct. Both coils control the supply air temperature whose setpoint is determined by a reverse-acting PID loop compares room temperature and its set point and outputs supply air temperature set point. The valves are controlled by a single direct-acting PID loop in which the supply air temperature is the process variable and the outputted value from the previous PID loop is the set point of the loop. The return air temperature and the room temperature were being used to determine the supply air temperature set point originally; the former control scheme in the form of a linear change and the latter one in the form of a PID loop. The linear change was eliminated during the assessment. As shown in Fig. 3 , the outside air damper of the unit is always completely open and does not modulate with respect to outside air despite having an economizer. After investigation on the unit\u2018s logic, it was found that the problem originated from the fact that the economizer control is not properly configured. To fix this problem, the economizer was configured to be enabled between 40°F and 70°F of outside air temperature. The mixed air temperature setpoint was also set to SATSP \u2013 2 to allow the outside air damper modulate during the economizer mode. Another example is a unit (AHU-7 located in Building 75, VA Salem) whose economizer operational range was modified. The unit is single-zone constant air volume with heating coil, cooling coil, and supply fan serving the fitness center of the health care facility. In this unit, both valves (the heating coil and the cooling coil valves) are being controlled by a single direct-acting PID loop in which the room temperature is the process variable compared against a discharge set point which linearly changes with respect to outside air temperature. The set point of the discharge temperature of the unit is linearly (with negative slope) determined by an outside air temperature based reset schedule in which the setpoint changes between 55°F and 65°F when the OAT is between 40°F and 60°F. Based on the unit\u2018s logic, it was found that the unit\u2019s economizer did not get enabled due to a lack of proper control setting. During the CC implementation phase, the enabling OAT range of the economizer has been modified in a way that the economizer enables when the outside air temperature goes below 65°F so the outside air damper starts accordingly modulating instead of being stuck at the minimum position, consequently (shown in Fig. 4 ). Another example is a single zone constant air volume unit that serves the Credit Union offices (AHU-5 located in Building 77, VA Salem). During trend assessment, it was discovered that the outside air damper position never changed even with the economizer command \u2018ON\u2019. Similarly, for AHU-5 the damper position of 9.0 (minimum of the range) did not change during the operation days with the economizer \u2018ON\u2019 as shown in Fig. 5 . It was also found that outside air damper attained different minimum positions during hot and cold weather for about three months (shown in Fig. 6 ). To finalize, analysis of the economizer trend-data and correction of problems identified resulted in projected savings of $30,765 including savings of 435,299 kWh of electricity and 2,760 MMBtu of natural gas (the breakdown of the savings is given in Table 2 per conditioned area of the facility). 2.3 Outside air damper (OAD) The dampers are controlled and modulated by the actuators connected to a control system to keep the airflow rate at a desirable value. There are cases when dampers do not follow the BAS signals, due to a need for repair or faulty control logic. This may increase energy consumption and sometimes cause a comfort issue. Such incidents can be detected by trending the damper position. Wang et. al. [26] and Najafi et. al. [27] have reported similar observations. During the CC analysis and the measurement process, it was found that the unit shown in Fig. 7 has substantial outside air intake at its minimum OA damper position more than the ASHRAE 170 Standard requirement. The unit is a single duct constant air volume unit with two outside air intakes; the two OA dampers work in parallel in a way that each of them has its own range of control signal with no overlap, which is shown on the unit diagram; the control signal of the top one is ranging from 8.0 to 13.0 (8.0 means minimum position, 13.0 means fully opened position), but the bottom one is ranging from 3.0 to 8.0 (3.0 means minimum position and 8.0 means fully opened position). The adequacy of outside air intake is signaled to the two OA dampers by the only controlling node placed at the OA flow meter. Any values between 8.0 and 13.0 keeps the lower OA damper at its maximum position and commands the upper OA damper to modulate correspondingly. Accordingly, any values between 3.0 and 8.0 holds the upper OA damper at its minimum position while let the lower damper modulate. The unit supplies 4,556 ft2 of patient rooms with a total of 5,928 [CFM] airflow. The unit is equipped with a humidifier whose valve is controlled by taking minimum outputs of two separate reverse-acting PID loops (one with return air relative humidity as the process variable and the other one with supply air relative humidity as the process variable). The minimum outside air intake of the unit is 4,600 CFM or 1 CFM/ft2, which is relatively higher than the minimum requirement (0.5 CFM/ft2) for patient rooms specified by ASHRAE Standard 170\u20132017 [20]. The minimum OA damper position has been changed to reduce the minimum flow to 0.5 CFM/ft2 as required by the standard. The OA damper position was trended before and after the implementation in Fig. 8 . The OAD control signal changes between 3.0 and 13.0. During the audits, it was found that reducing the OAD control signal from 8 to 6 can meet the required OA flow specified by the standard. This change was projected to save about $2,961 per year, which includes 19,143 kWh and 717 MMBtu reduction in electricity and natural gas consumption, respectively. To recap, analysis on the outside airflow intake trend-data resulted in $20,591 of projected savings including 176,514 kWh of electricity and 3,599 MMBtu of natural gas (the breakdown of the savings is given in Table 3 per conditioned area of the facility). 2.4 Supply air temperature (SAT) One of the most important parameters affecting the energy consumption of a unit is the supply air temperature setpoint. Usually, the units have a constant setpoint at 55°F, which leads to unnecessary cooling and heating when the thermal heat gain of the zone is low. A reset schedule based on the zone heat gain can effectively reduce energy use. However, automation systems often reset supply air temperature based on the outside air temperature since control based on zone thermal load is seldom practical. Ji et al. [28] showed that a calibrated modified RC-model (resistance and capacitance electrical model) of a zone which includes thermal masses as separate nodes, can sufficiently estimate a zone\u2018s thermal load, but the process is not simple enough to be implemented on a real system. Trending the supply air temperature as a function of the outside air temperature can show the presence or absence of a reset schedule. If there is an existing reset schedule, it may be further optimized. As an example, a single duct constant air volume unit with 100% outside air serving some dayrooms (AHU-7 located in Building 2, VA Salem) is presented herein. The unit is equipped with preheating coil, cooling coil, supply fan, and humidifier. The preheating coil and the cooling coil control the preheat temperature and the supply air temperature, respectively. Two separate direct-acting PID loop control each coil valve. The humidifier\u2018s valve is controlled by taking minimum outputs of two separate reverse-acting PID loops (one with return air relative humidity process and the other one with supply air relative humidity as the process variables). The unit has a constant supply air temperature setpoint at 55°F and the system generally maintains the supply temperature between 54°F and 56°F as shown in Fig. 9 . The ESL team implemented a schedule where the SAT setpoint will be 62.0°F when the OAT is less than or equal to 40.0°F, and linearly reduces to 55°F when the OAT is equal to or higher than 60.0°F (shown in Fig. 10 ). The measure is projected to save $749 annually that includes savings from the reduction of 156 kWh and 234 MMBtu in electricity and natural gas consumption, respectively. Another example is a single duct constant air volume unit with no exhaust which was detected to have an abnormal supply air temperature reset. The unit has heating coil, cooling coil, and supply fan (AHU-BE1 located in Building 143, VA Salem). The heating coil and the cooling coil control the supply air temperature with a single direct-acting PID loop. As shown is presented in Fig. 11 , the SAT increases as the outside air increases. This abnormal reset (the problem is not associated with the unit cooling capacity since the unit became capable of maintaining the supply air temperature at 55°F even at high outside air temperature after the CC measure implementation) causes comfort issues when the outside air temperature is high since the unit is unable to maintain the space temperature setpoint with supply air near 70°F. The same reset schedule shown in Fig. 10 was implemented on the unit and is projected to improve comfort but increase the energy consumption of the unit by $2,193 annually, which includes 36,700 kWh and 278 MMBtu increases in electricity and natural gas consumptions, respectively. The final example in this section is given to show a capacity issue, i.e., the unit cannot maintain the supply air temperature setpoint. The unit is a single duct constant air volume unit with a capacity of 5,080 [CFM] that serves some nursing stations and hallways. The unit is equipped with preheating coil, cooling coil, supply fan, and humidifier in the supply duct and exhaust fan on the exhaust duct. The humidifier\u2019s valve is controlled by taking minimum outputs of two separate reverse-acting PID loops (one with return air relative humidity as the process variable and the other one with supply air relative humidity as the process variable). As shown in Fig. 12 , the unit is not able to maintain the 55°F setpoint when the OAT is above 70°F. To review, analysis of the supply air temperature trend-data identified measures with projected savings of $119,543 including 1,237,490 kWh of electricity and 14,109 MMBtu of natural gas (the breakdown of the savings is given in Table 4 per conditioned area of the facility) as well as measures that improved comfort. 2.5 Chilled water and hot water valves positions The chilled water valve and hot water valve modulate to maintain the supply air temperature at a set point temperature. The first principle is that the heating and the cooling valves should not be open at the same time which is sometimes called fighting coils [24] and results in energy waste due to simultaneous heating and cooling. This may be caused by inappropriate system logic. Wang et. al. [26] recognized such a control logic issue by trending DX-cooling coil and boiler status trends. It is frequently caused by a higher than necessary minimum flow set points in terminal boxes. It can also be caused by an improperly tuned control loop, leading to loop oscillation and overshooting for an extended time period [24]. In another study [29], faulty chiller valve operation was investigated by a model-based FDD algorithm where an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) was used. Gao et. al. [30] developed a system-level FDD algorithm that takes advantage of t-statistics to identify low delta-T faults in a heat exchanger by comparing the measurement temperature difference across the component and corresponding predicted values calculated from a dynamical mass and energy model. In the present study, a single duct variable air volume unit serving a cardiac rehabilitation and a woman\u2018s clinic with a total area of 11,726 [ft2] (AHU-10 located in Building 1, VA Fayetteville) was discovered to have valve issue. The unit has heating coil, cooling coil, supply VFD fan, and humidifier in the supply duct and return VFD fan in the return duct. The cooling coil and the heating coil maintain the supply air temperature at its setpoint and the humidifier controls the relative humidity of the supplied air with the use of separate PID controllers. This unit suffers from one of the common issues as mentioned before, overshooting, due to the untuned PID controller. The preheating coil valve (PHV) and the cooling coil valve (CCV) of the system are controlling the supply air temperature. The cooling coil valve and the preheating coil valve are direct acting and reverse acting, respectively. Direct-acting means the larger the control signal to the valve, the more open the valve becomes. Contrarily, a reverse acting valve closes as the control signal gets larger. As mentioned, the CCV has a direct acting controlling loop in which a higher value shown on left-axis of the plot corresponds to relatively more open position. In contrary, the preheating coil valve of the unit has a reverse acting controlling loop in which the valve becomes less opened as the value on the left axis of the plot increases. As an example, if the position changes from 40% to 80%, it means the cooling coil valve becomes more opened and the preheating coil valve gets less opened. Hence the CCV in Fig. 13 -(a) is more open at 60% than it is at 30%. As shown in Fig. 13-(b), the frequent CCV modulation leads to wide supply temperature changes. The CCV oscillation likely shortens the valve life, but more importantly, the unit cannot maintain the SAT at the setpoint (55°F) due to the improperly controlled valve and causes a ± 5°change in SAT around the set point. The identified problem was addressed and the PID loop of the cooling coil valve was tuned, which resulted in the relatively stable SAT. As shown in Fig. 14 , the cooling coil valve position is no longer hunting and the supply air temperature is being controlled properly in a manner that the SAT can be maintained at the set point with ± 1.0 degree of error. Fig. 15 depicts another tuned PID case, where the cooling coil valve position is smoothly changing and generally maintains the SAT within ± 1.5 degrees of the set point. 2.6 Fan performance Most VAV AHUs control fan speed by maintaining a static pressure setpoint at a sensor located 2/3 of the way from the fan to the end of the main duct. This static pressure is often maintained higher than necessary, leading to wasted fan power. This paper shows two examples using fan trend data. In the first example, a single duct variable air volume system with a steam humidifier that serves BioMed and occupational health clinics is studied (AHU-17 located in Building 1, VA Fayetteville). The supply air static pressure is nearly two times the set point of 1.0 in·H2O from 12/23/2018 to 10/30/2019 as shown in Fig. 16 -(a). The trended fan speed (Fig. 16-(b)) indicates that the fan was in override at a speed of 2,332 [rpm] so that the fan speed has been increased by 15%, as a result, the static pressure went up by 90%. The problem was fixed by changing the fan operation from manual to automatic mode. The second example is a single duct variable air volume unit (AHU-11 located in Building 1, VA Fayetteville) with a return fan that serves exam rooms and reception rooms (the static pressure and the supply air temperature of the unit are controlled by the variable frequency driven fan and the coils, respectively, with the use of individual PID loops. A temperature-based economizer mode is existing which allows the outside air damper to modulate at different outside air temperature.). A night time reset schedule was implemented on the terminal boxes supplied by this unit to reduce the static pressure setpoint from 1.5 in·H2O to 1.0 in·H2O between 6 PM and 6 AM. This reduced fan speed from about 95% to slightly less than 40% (shown in Fig. 17 ). The fan power was not measured, but it was projected to be reduced by 80\u201390% according to the fan law. Δ W % = W a f t e r C C M e a s u r e - W b e f o r e C C M e a s u r e W b e f o r e C C M e a s u r e = N a f t e r C C M e a s u r e N b e f o r e C C M e a s u r e - 1 . W b e f o r e C C M e a s u r e W b e f o r e C C M e a s u r e = 0.40 0.95 - 1 . W b e f o r e C C M e a s u r e W b e f o r e C C M e a s u r e ≈ 90 % where Δ W is the estimation of the fan power reduction and W is the fan power before and after the CC measure implementation. 2.7 Supply air static pressure (SASP) The static pressure setpoint is a mean to control the fan speed to provide sufficient air for the system. A constant static pressure setpoint generally wastes fan power. When loads are low and less air is required the static pressure can be reduced. One common approach is to reset the static pressure based on the outside air temperature by employing variable air volume unit. Another issue is associated with the static pressure sensor when the sensor is out of calibration. If the reading is too low, the fan will use more energy to reach the set point. If the reading is too high, there may be insufficient air leading to comfort problems. In this regard, one of the studied units is a single duct variable air volume unit serving 5,404 [ft2] of psychology services (AHU-24 located in Building 1, VA Fayetteville). The supply air temperature of the unit is controlled by the heating and the cooling coils with the use of PID controller. The static pressure set point of the unit was constant at 1.5 [in·H2O] from 10/31/2018 to 01/08/2019 as shown red symbols in Fig. 18 . Subsequently, the static pressure has been reset to the schedule shown in Fig. 19 so the static pressure setpoint increases as outside air temperature rise from 60°F to 90°F. The reset schedule shown in Fig. 19 is estimated to save $132 annually in this small AHU by reducing electricity usage by 2,449 kWh. Another issue is the unsuitable range for the static pressure resets schedule. Having a reset schedule on the static pressure setpoint is an energy conservation measure that can save a decent amount of energy. Since an OAT-based reset schedule is typically being used due to its simplicity and reliability, it should be properly set in a way that the static pressure setpoint increases as the OA temperature rises. For instance, the unit described previously (first example in section 2.6) has a reset schedule on its supply air static pressure that linearly changes from 0.7 to 1.0 [in·H2O] when the outside air temperature is between 60 [°F] and 90 [°F]. For the OAT out of the range, the static pressure is constant at 0.7 [in·H2O] when the OAT is below 60 [°F] and 1.0 [in·H2O] when the OAT is above 90 [°F]. The ESL team changed static pressure to higher reset values which vary between 1.0 and 1.5 [in·H2O] (shown in Fig. 20 ). Analysis of the supply air static pressure trend-data and subsequent changes to state pressure set points in 59 AHUs resulted in $15,302 of projected savings from 317,854 kWh of reduced electricity use as shown in Table 5 per conditioned area of the facility. 3 Summary Abstract This study focused on presenting the process of using trend data analysis to identify potential energy reduction measures and deficiencies and its results in three hospital facilities. Trend data can speed the identification of potential energy-use reduction measures. Table 6 summarizes the value of the savings measures identified from trend analysis in each of the three hospitals, as well as the projected electricity and natural gas savings from these measures at each hospital. The annual savings from these measures varied from $0.05/ft2 at Fayetteville to $0.30/ft2 at Durham. The fraction of the savings identified using trend data also varied widely among the three sites. 97% of the savings identified at Salem were identified using trend data, while the corresponding percentages at Durham and Fayetteville were 62% and 17%. The site-to-site variation is expected since the facilities and systems at each site differ considerably, and the operating staff at each site is different and prioritized different issues based on their experience and the systems at each site. Note that the measures identified were projected to result in annual natural gas savings of 28.4 kBtu/sq.ft. and 2.22 kWh/sq.ft. (7.6 kBtu/sq.ft.) of electricity, for a total reduction of 36.0 kBtu/sq.ft. in the energy use index. This is an 18% reduction in the area-weighted average EUI of 197 kBtu/(ft2-yr) for these three hospitals and was achieved in spite of the EUI of 197 being below the 5th percentile Energy Star EUI of 211 kBtu/(ft2-yr) for hospitals [16]. The projected cost and energy savings breakdowns due to different types of commissioning measures identified using trend data analysis are shown in Fig. 21 to Fig. 23. Fig. 21 shows that the opportunities for turning AHUs off were very large at Salem and Durham, accounting for nearly 40% of the savings opportunities identified by the trend analysis, but Fayetteville had virtually none of these opportunities. The other major opportunities identified from the trend data analysis were related to supply air temperature resets at Durham. While it is tempting to emphasize these major opportunities, the remaining opportunities identified by trend analysis accounted for $91,472 in opportunities, and may have been more important in the sense that the largest opportunities would undoubtedly have been identified using the standard diagnostic approaches used in the commissioning process. However, some or many of these smaller opportunities would likely have been missed since the labor intensive site measurements and analysis required to identify them probably may not have been performed. Fig. 22 and Fig. 23 show that the AHU on/off, economizer, outside air damper and supply air temperature measures all saved both electricity and natural gas, while the supply air static pressure measures saved only electricity. These opportunities summarized in this section were realized using a systematic approach to examining trend data and implementation of Continuous Commissioning® principles. The successful use of trend data to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the CC® Process can be attributed to the following key observations: 1. Availability of building trend and interval data. 2. Long term study of the data to isolate seasonal variations. 3. Use of models to predict savings that do not overlap with other efficiency measures. 4 Conclusions In this study, the Continuous Commissioning® (CC®) version of the Existing Building Commissioning process was implemented in three large hospitals and optimized the HVAC operations to improve their energy use while maintaining comfort without any capital system investment. The many different ways in which trend data was used to identify opportunities and to verify the implementation of efficiency measures has been presented. In the case studies presented, commissioning measures accounting for 64% of the total annual commissioning cost savings of $592,816 were identified by analyzing trend data. Trend analysis of AHU ON/OFF status, economizer, outside air damper position, supply air temperature, and supply air static pressure corresponded to 51%, 8%, 5%, 31%, and 4% of the total projected savings, respectively. The use of trend analysis identified measures in the three case-study hospitals that are projected to reduce the EUI of the three hospitals by 16%, 21% and 19% respectively, even though the average consumption of the three hospitals was below the 5th percentile of hospital consumption. The contribution of specific measures to the savings at each site varied widely due to many variables that are unique to each facility including, the type and level of controls available and the willingness of facility operators to implement specific operational changes. The availability and use of trend data in these facilities saved time in identifying these operational improvements and likely identified some improvements that would not have been identified using manual diagnostic techniques. Continuous engagement of this low cost and resource-intensive analysis tool can significantly reduce the operational costs for facilities.
