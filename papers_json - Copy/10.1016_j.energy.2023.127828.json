Handling Editor: Dr X Zhao In this paper, PSO-OMRC model is proposed for heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system. The PSO-OMRC predicts SPT in HVAC for energy saving and thermal comfort of persons in room. PSO-OMRC used data collected from temperature, humidity, PIR, and thermal camera sensors in HVAC installed rooms for SPT prediction. In existing HVAC systems, SPT is constant and consumes more energy. Moreover, SPT prediction using traditional machine learning algorithms considers various parameters such as room temperature, humidity and person count in room. Existing algorithms considers the above parameters for energy saving in HVAC and thermal comfort for persons, whereas other parameters such as room walls and ceiling temperature, human body temperature need to be considered for SPT prediction and for energy saving in HVAC. The PSO-OMRC model predicts the SPT based on number of occupants and microclimatic conditions such as environment temperature, humidity, room wall temperature and ceiling temperature. From experimental results, the utilization of the thermal image occupant model provides significant energy savings in the PSO-OMRC model. In nano coated room, PSO-OMRC model is evaluated with the implementation of a thermal image occupant model to improve energy savings, resulting in approximately 25.2% of energy savings while maintaining the level of thermal comfort.

In metropolitan areas, HVAC systems are the major contributor for global warming. HVAC system releases fluorocarbon, CO2 and consumes high electrical energy [1]. HVAC systems consist of an air conditioner, air handler, compressor, condenser, thermal expansion valve, air filter, chiller, duct system and microcontroller-based temperature controller. There are different types of HVAC system such as heating, cooling and hybrid split, duct free, zoned, centralized and packaged air conditioning systems. Moreover, centralized systems are commonly used in many areas. Nowadays, HVAC system energy usage is monitored through cloud computing [2]. In HVAC system, energy consumption is reduced through occupant prediction and temperature control using artificial intelligence techniques [3]. Energy savings in HVAC systems are achieved using different methods namely ensemble model of machine learning, an adaptive demand controlled strategy [4], occupancy estimation using edge computing for thermal setpoint [5], hybrid approach for temperature control using fuzzy logic optimization [6] and deep reinforcement learning temperature setpoint control [7]. The occupancy prediction [8] and regression algorithm [9] are traditional algorithms used in temperature controller of HVAC systems. Thermal comfort refers to the level of perceived coolness by the individuals in a room through HVAC. HVAC system consumes more energy, compared to other household electric appliances. Room environment temperature, humidity level and number of occupant data are collected and applied in neural network for optimization of SPT, reduce energy consumption, and provides maximum thermal for occupants in the room. Sensors are used for controlling the HVAC systems for automatic setpoint temperature. Traditional HVAC system use manual selection [10], the occupant in HVAC installed room never obtains the thermal comfort due to variations in environment parameters such as outer temperature, inside room temperature, humidity and occupant. Estimation of occupant count is crucial to adjust the indoor air temperature for optimal SPT and maximum thermal comfort [11]. In order to solve above problem, estimation of the number of occupants in room, indoor environment parameters and human body temperature are required. For prediction of the optimal setpoint temperature in HVAC system, needs indoor parameters and microclimatic data including wall and roof temperature within the room. 1.1 Problem statement SPT of HVAC system is predicted through combination of various parameters such as room temperature, humidity, CO2 level, person count in room which is obtained from different sensors such as temperature and humidity sensor, CO2 sensor [12], PIR sensor [13], ultrasonic sensor [14] and video cameras [15]. These sensors have low sensitivity, which leads to errors in occupant count measurement. Inaccurate occupant detection leads to inaccurate prediction of SPT and reduces thermal comfort for occupants in the room. The existing HVAC control system measures temperature, humidity and occupant information, never considers microclimatic conditions such as wall and roof temperatures and human body temperature in the room. Thermal comfort for the persons in the room and energy saving of HVAC depends upon SPT. In existing system, SPT is predicted based on number of persons in the room and room temperature, whereas thermal comfort in the room depends on various other parameters such as microclimatic conditions based building temperature and individual person body temperature. For example, rooms in the middle of the building and corner rooms of building have room temperature variation due to microclimatic conditions. Moreover, persons stay long hours in rooms never need same level of thermal comfort. The above problem is addressed with inclusion of various parameters such as wall temperature and human body temperature measured through thermal camera and the above data need to be used in SPT prediction. 1.2 Contributions In this paper, PSO-OMRC is proposed for energy saving in HVAC and high thermal comfort for persons in the room. The proposed PSO-OMRC method predicts the SPT based on various input parameters such as room wall temperature, ceiling temperature, occupant count, humidity and microclimatic conditions. Moreover, proposed PSO-OMRC is tested in a room environment, where SiO2 nano coating was done on inside walls of room. The nano coating maintains the chillness of the room for longer duration of time through high reflection of chill air and act as an insulator. \u2022 To predict room temperature based on microclimatic conditions and variations of temperature inside the room based on room location in the building. \u2022 To analyze, nano coated rooms temperature variation based on locations of room in the buildings. Create a dataset which consists of various parameters such as microclimatic condition, room wall temperature, ceiling temperature, humidity and occupant count for SPT prediction using proposed PSO-OMRC. \u2022 To compare, proposed PSO-OMRC method with traditional algorithms such as GPR, SVR, SW, DT and MLR for energy efficiency and thermal comfort using statistical analysis and estimated the energy consumption due to PSO-OMRC method. PSO-OMRC predicts optimal SPT based on current microclimatic conditions, human body temperature and achieves energy savings with thermal comfort. Furthermore, SiO2 nanocoating on the interior surfaces of the room [16] is applied, and energy efficiency is increased through reducing the impact of outside temperatures in room. Energy saving performance of the PSO-OMRC model is evaluated in an ordinary painted room and nano coated room. The following sections of this paper are organized as: literature survey relevant to the proposed system is discussed in section 2. In section 3, the materials and procedures utilized in the PSO-OMRC of the HVAC system are described. Experimental results are discussed in section 4 and validated the proposed system effectiveness, and section 5 provides summary of the findings. 2 Literature survey Conventional method control HVAC through different techniques for thermal comfort and energy consumption are reviewed and analyzed in this section. Different methods that improve HVAC performance are investigated and their influence on energy savings is reviewed [17]. The SPT in HVAC system reduces energy consumption and provides thermal comfort to occupants in the room. Accurate measurement of the persons count in a room requires the use of multiple PIR sensors [18]. Internet of Things (IoT) and client server cloud architecture are used for estimation of the number of students present in university lecture halls. The room relative humidity and CO2 levels are used for estimation of persons count. A thermal model based on neural network determines ideal temperature setpoint for the HVAC system based on the indoor temperature and humidity data [19]. Energy consumption and non-linear problems in HVAC are solved through ANN models. In comparison to other models, ANN models achieve higher accuracy [20]. Real time data are used to build thermal comfort based prediction model, and subjective measures are used for validation of ANN models [21]. Model predictive control uses occupant prediction methods and reduce energy consumption and maintains high thermal comfort. The prediction of human count based setpoint temperature results in energy savings in HVAC installed buildings [22,23]. GPR model integrated with meta-heuristic optimization algorithms such as particle swarm optimization, genetic algorithm, artificial bee colony, ant colony optimization, differential evolution, and grey wolf optimizer. GPR model trained using real time dataset and meta-heuristic optimization algorithms are used to optimize the hyperparameters such as kernel function, noise level and regularization parameter. Hyperparameters are optimized by minimizing the mean squared error between the predicted and actual values. Experimental result showed, among the hybrid models, the GPR-PSO model achieved high accuracy for prediction [24]. Sensor data are used for occupant detection and monitor the movement of occupants inside the room. HVAC control system efficiency is tested under different conditions to meet the user's comfort in different zones [25]. Power efficient occupant based system was developed using PIR sensor and predicts person count in the room. HVAC system is controlled based on occupant count and save energy [26]. A statistical model with bayesian approach had been proposed for monitoring and analyzing multiple humans in a room environment using an infrared sensor. The background subtraction tool and bayesian filters were used for detection of occupant movement in room [27]. To save energy in HVAC systems, price based demand response controller is developed. The performance of controller is evaluated based on thermal comfort and temperature differences in various zones [28]. Energy management framework is proposed using deep reinforcement learning agent, which learns to adjust the air conditioner (AC) setpoint and reduces energy consumption. Uncertainty-awareness is incorporated in to learning agent. Bayesian neural network model is used for uncertainty in predictions decision-making process and enables the agent to make decisions in situations with high uncertainty [29]. Computational intelligence (CI) techniques improve the energy efficiency of AC systems. Several research areas identified to improve the effectiveness of CI techniques [30]. Energy efficiency in residential AC systems considers the variability of energy consumption across different AC rooms. Using clustering techniques, AC rooms are grouped based on their energy consumption patterns. Regression models are developed for each cluster and predicted the energy consumption of a room and validated the accuracy using a collected dataset [31]. Data-driven approach is developed using machine learning techniques and modeled the energy consumption of AC systems. The experimental setup involved in data collection from residential AC units in a testbed and developed prediction model for energy consumption. The model was integrated with control system and automatically adjusts AC operation based on the real-time data inputs [32]. Internet of Things approach using low-cost sensor technology and artificial intelligence technique improve the energy efficiency of buildings. Sensors are deployed throughout building and collected data on various environmental and occupancy parameters. Machine learning techniques used for analysis of data collected by the sensors and make decisions on energy usage optimization [33]. The energy consumption of reflective coatings on the inner walls of a room in an indoor environment was evaluated in an experimental study. The environmental temperature impact inside the room was reduced as of result of using various cool paints on the wall surface [34]. The coating on a building reduces heat flow inside the room through opaque elements. Energy savings in buildings with HVAC are evaluated based on the cool coating on inner walls and coating thickness. Coating on walls reduces heat transfer from ambient environment and save energy through thermal comfort. In order to save enrgy, IR-reflective paint on inside walls were compared to non-IR reflective paint in rooms. IR-reflective paint decreases wall temperatures due to a reduction in heat transfer through the ambient environment [35]. Thermal radiation and heat transfer decrease due to low-emissivity painting on the windows of the room and consume less energy [36]. Cool white coating reduces solar heat and indoor temperature. Cool white coating decreases the radiant heat flux from the sun [37]. The existing method never considers human body temperature, building temperature parameters such as wall and roof temperature and microclimatic conditions such as outdoor temperature and humidity level for SPT prediction. The above parameter reduces thermal comfort for persons in the room and consumes more energy. Existing system considers human count, temperature and humidity in the room. The RGB camera used for human count, whereas the wall temperature inside the room and human body temperature never considered for SPT prediction. Person long stay in chill room needs change in thermal comfort, which is need to be addressed during SPT prediction. The proposed PSO-OMRC method considers the temperature of the occupant, temperature of walls, and ceiling in a room for perfect SPT prediction for HVAC. This paper proposes an optimal SPT strategy for HVAC energy savings, which takes into account various parameters including microclimatic data, human body temperature and occupant count measurement. 3 Materials and methods 3.1 Data acquisition Data from HVAC system was gathered from the building of Aalim Muhammed Salegh College of Engineering situated in Chennai and implemented in the PSO-OMRC model for the optimization of SPT. The datas are collected from meeting rooms, which have centralized air conditioning, and data are collected with and without occupants in the room. HVAC model number DBC0903V000001 S, Daikin DBC series commercial (7.5\u201312.5 tons). Scroll compressors with high performance and low noise are adjusted with their speed and matched the necessary heating and cooling condition through effective control. Indoor forward curb fans with belt drive motors facilitate easy field belt and pulley adjustment for airflow control in supply fans. The actuator in variable air volume (VAV) box modulates damper position in each room based on the SPT prediction. The supply and return air fan speeds are automatically adjusted through PSO-OMRC using a variable-speed motor for energy savings. Thermal image temperature data is used for human body temperature measurement, occupant count measurement, and wall, and ceiling temperature measurement. The proposed system architecture with room layout, sensing parameters, PSO-OMRC operation are shown in Fig. 1 . The proposed PSO-OMRC model is implemented in three different rooms, designated as room A, B, and C respectively. Table 1 shows the sensors fixed in each room for data collection, the type of coating applied to the room walls and the size of each room. Table 2 shows the thermal transmittance property of building parameters such as wall and roof. The sensors such as PIR, temperature and humidity are fixed in each room for data collection and used for HVAC control. In addition to this, PIR and door sensors are fixed in room A and thermal camera is fixed in room B and room C to measure occupant count. The Raspberry Pi3 processor is utilized for implementation of the PSO-OMRC controller, with sensors. The data collected from the sensors is then transmitted to Thingspeak cloud using the Raspberry Pi3. The Raspberry Pi controller is responsible for preprocessing the data, feature extraction and classification of the data for thermal comfort through PSO-OMRC. The data collected from the sensors every for 60 s and given to proposed PSO-OMRC. PSO-OMRC has modules for data collection from sensors and preprocessing the data with DWT to eliminate repeated data. The HM-TJ11-3AMF-Mini1 thermal camera from Hikmicro is used for measurement of room wall, roof and human temperature. The thermal sensitivity of the Hikmicro thermal imaging camera is < 0.04 °C, and has 19,200 pixels with resolution of 160 by 120 in infrared (IR). The experimental rooms are shown in Fig. 2 . All the rooms considered for experiment are facing towards same direction and located in the same floor in a building. The temperature conditions of the room A and B are same and never receive direct sunlight. Room C is corner room and exposed to the outside temperature. The sun causes the temperature in room C, rises significantly and makes the room uncomfortably warm compared to Room B and Room A. The thermography image collected from room c using thermal camera is shown in Fig. 3 . The PIR sensor can detect human presence and movement within a room, which can be used to estimate occupancy levels. This information can be combined with thermal camera images in room C to provide a more accurate estimation of the number of people in the room, their location, and their activity level. By using this data to adjust the HVAC system setpoint temperature, energy consumption can be optimized while still maintaining a comfortable environment for occupants. 3.2 Nanotechnology based wall paint in room SiO2 nano coat is used as insulation against heat loss and improves resistance to corrosion [38]. SiO2 nano coat is painted inside the room. In SiO2 nano coat, the insulating component is the silica aerogel material. The chemical composition of coating material is hydrophobic SiO2 aerogel, wetting agent made from silicone, dispersant containing Alkyl ammonium salt dispersant, acrylic resin, additives, TiO2, glass beads, ceramic powder, defoamer and deionized water [39]. Silica aerogel is an excellent insulation, characterized by an extremely less thermal conductivity of approximately 0.005 W/m K at room temperature, porosity range of 80%\u201399.8%, less density of around 0.003 g/cm3, SiO2 nanoparticles with a diameter of approximately 7 nm, refraction at approximately 1.05 and large surface area ranging between 500 and 1200 m2/g [40]. SiO2 nano paint is best insulator and worst thermal conductor. In the experimentation the nano coat is used inside the room walls for cooling applications. The nano-size particles reflect IR radiation, after nano coating, the reduction in cooling load is identified, and reflectivity of the wall increases to 0.90 [41]. In this work, the nano paint has been applied to the interior walls of room C for energy savings. Nano paint is applied to walls in liquid form with three multiple thin layer of coating. The different coatings are utilized in building environments for reducing energy usage, maintain thermal comfort, which are summarized in Table 3 . Fig. 4 (a) shows nano coat applied on room C and Fig. 4 (b) illustrates Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) image of a nano SiO2 coat. Table 4 shows the coating type, layer of coating, thickness and energy efficiency. 3.3 Optimal setpoint temperature prediction in PSO-OMRC Data for the PSO-OMRC model is obtained from sensors such as temperature sensor, humidity level sensor, PIR sensor and thermal camera images is analyzed. Data collected from sensors and thermal images are applied with machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict SPT. The ML algorithms used such as gaussian process (GPR), decision tree regression (DT), support vector (SVR), stepwise regression (SWR) and multiple linear regressions (MLR) are used for SPT prediction. ML algorithm predicts SPT based on data training and hyperparameter tuning. GPR algorithm has better performance than other ML algorithms such as SVR, SWR, DT and MLR. The GPR algorithm is used for prediction in PSO-OMRC. Mat lab software R2022a is used for prediction analysis. The training process utilizes 80% of the gathered sensor data, while the remaining 20% is utilized for testing purposes. During the process of training, ten-fold cross validation approach is utilized and selects best prediction model. To validate the prediction, three statistical parameters such as mean-absolute-error (MAE), R-squared (R2) and root-mean-square-error (RMSE) are calculated. GPR performs better and applied for SPT prediction in HVAC. The process of applying machine learning regression algorithm and prediction of SPT is described in Fig. 5 . PSO is an evolutionary computing, utilized for the optimal hyperparameters tuning before optimization. In PSO, group of particles navigates among the search space and discovers the most optimal position [42]. The particle position and velocity are constantly updated using equations (1) and (2) [43]. (1) v i m = w v i m + c 1 r 1 ( p b e s t i m − y i m ) + c 2 r 2 ( g b e s t k − y i m ) (2) y i m + 1 = y i m + v i m + 1 Where v i m is velocity, y i m is present solution and w is weight of inertia, which indicates earlier velocity vector impact on the current vector. The positive constant coefficients c 1 , c 2 and random variables r 1 , r 2 have a uniform distribution between 0 and 1 [44]. The acceptable range of values of SPT for HVAC is given by users. The regression algorithm is used for SPT prediction after tuning hyperparameters using the PSO algorithm to predicts the optimal SPT for HVAC. The PSO optimized model performances are evaluated with different indicators such as RMSE, MAE and R-squared (R2) for error calculation among the SPT actual and prediction value. The Proposed PSO-OMRC model is more accurate, MAE and RMSE values are low and R2 value is high. The ML algorithms such as MLR, DT, SWR, SVR and GPR after PSO optimization show an accuracy of 83%, 89.7%, 93.1%, 94.3% and 96.8% respectively for predicting the SPT for HVAC. Fig. 6 represents the statistical parameters RMSE, MAE and R2 value for different regression models after hyperparameter optimization with PSO algorithm. PSO-OMRC optimize SPT for a room based on current microclimatic data from sensor data, thermal image based environment temperature value and occupant count. According to SPT values, HVAC temperature is changed, which ensures optimal thermal comfort for the individuals present in room. In HVAC, considering the number of persons occupying the room and the dimensions of the room, the total air flow and air change per hour are calculated by PSO-OMRC based on ASHRAE 62.1 standard. PSO-OMRC predicts SPT, then the VAV box is adjusted and the pressure in the air duct is changed. PSO-OMRC controls fan speed based on air change. Reduced air flow reduces power consumption, results in energy savings in the HVAC. The energy savings based on fan speed switching through the PSO-OMRC controller are tabulated in Table 5 . The block diagram of proposed PSO-OMRC controller is shown in Fig. 7 . 4 Experimentation and results The proposed PSO-OMRC model uses the GPR algorithm for accurate SPT prediction. In test room A, room B and C, PSO-OMRC is implemented in different conditions as mentioned in Table 6 . Temperature data, humidity level and PIR data are used in rooms for SPT prediction along with occupant count information for the HVAC system through the proposed PSO-OMRC. 4.1 Occupant count estimation using sensors and camera images The testing was conducted for five days in the meeting room of the college, and the room is occupied with faculty members. The occupants are manually counted. Various tests under different conditions have been conducted and verified the reliability of the occupant estimation through PSO-OMRC. During test 1, ordinary paint is used on inner side wall of room A. For occupant count measurement, PIR and door sensors are used. The PIR sensor is utilized for detecting movements of persons, while the door sensor is used for detection of instances of door opening and closing. When more than one occupant enters the room at the same time, PIR counts as one. When one occupant enters and one occupant leaves at the same time, it will estimate the occupant count wrongly, results in occupant count error. The accuracy in estimating occupant is about 71.6%. However, PIR is unable to count multiple individuals simultaneously, leading to errors in occupant count. The occupancy estimation using PIR and door sensors are inaccurate. The occupancy estimation using PIR and door sensors are shown in Fig. 8 . In test 2, RGB camera is used in room B with ordinary paint for occupant count measurement. The occupant estimation accuracy of the method is about 78.42%. RGB camera based counting systems works only during ambient lighting. The field of vision of an RGB camera is far larger and never estimate correct occupant count during low lighting or high population density. When the lighting in a room is low, occupants are not easily identified, and results in decrease in accuracy. Occupant estimation using RGB camera images is not appropriate under such circumstances. The occupancy estimation using RGB camera images are shown in Fig. 9 . RGB camera was replaced with thermal camera in room B for occupant count, improved the accuracy in occupant count. Thermal camera is connected to Raspberry Pi3 via wifi and the IP webcam app. Human body, wall and roof temperature are measured using thermal camera and considered for optimal SPT prediction in PSO-OMRC. The thermal camera images, image temperature values and sensor values stored are in a Microsoft excel file in Raspberry Pi hardware. The K-means algorithm is used between two successive frames of the thermal image for segmentation. Next, classification is used for segmented classes. The difference map is created by comparing two images and analyzing the differences between them. It separates pixels into a number of blobs, which represent humans, and the number of blobs establishes the occupant number by bilinear interpolation. The connected component analysis algorithm is utilized for location of connected regions and the accuracy for occupancy count measurement in room C is about 89.10%. Fig. 10 illustrates the occupancy estimation using thermal camera images. In test 3, a thermal camera is installed in nano coated room C and occupant count is measured. Nano paint thermal resistance property keeps the cooling effect in the room for a longer period of time. As a result, low temperature setpoint are utilized, which results in rapid temperature change. To assess the nano coating impact on energy savings, an initial test was conducted. Test involved the comparision of nano coated room C and ordinary painted room B. The HVAC was turned on in both rooms for about 30 min and then turned off. The indoor temperatures of both rooms were measured utilizing a digital thermometer, and the results were represented in Fig. 11 . Experimental result demonstrated that occupant count estimation utilizing PIR and door sensor is inaccurate when more than one occupant enters or exits the room simultaneously. RGB camera accuracy has inability for occupant count during low-light conditions. Thermal image-based occupancy count can provide accurate estimations of the number of occupants. The performance of the HVAC system is better with thermal image based occupancy and a nano coated room. The accuracy of occupant sensors in various rooms and the occupant count are provided in Table 7 . Thermal camera based occupancy estimation has more accuracy and is used in the proposed PSO-OMRC model. Then thermal-based occupant count is used for SPT prediction through PSO-OMRC model. 4.2 Occupancy-based set point temperature prediction The temperature setpoint of HVAC is controlled using PSO-OMRC based on the measured occupant count. The ML algorithms such as GPR, SVR, SWR, DT and MLR used for prediction of SPT. GPR accuracy in prediction for SPT in HVAC system is more accurate. To improve accuracy, hyperparameters are tuned using PSO algorithm for SPT prediction. The PSO selects the suitable hyperparameters automatically and minimizes the objective function, this is one of the techniques used for the automatic selection of hyperparameters in PSO-OMRC. The accuracy of SPT prediction using perfect thermal occupancy is compared with ground truth SPT, which is manually provided by the users and shown in Fig. 12 . 4.3 Energy savings in HVAC system based on PSO-OMRC The energy saving of the proposed PSO-OMRC is compared with conventional controller. The proposed PSO-OMRC model maintains the different cooling strategy. The temperature was set to 27 °C when room was unoccupied, and SPT was adjusted to maintain a temperature range of 22 °C to 26 °C during occupied hours, depending on the number of occupants present in the room. The proposed PRO-OMRC saved 7.3% of energy in room A after occupant measurement through PIR and door sensor. When an RGB camera is used in room B, for occupant measurement, the energy savings was about 10.9%. In the proposed PSO-OMRC model, RGB camera was replaced using thermal camera occupancy model and improved the energy savings, resulted in 16.60% energy savings. A perfect occupant estimation model using a thermal camera was used in nano coated room C. The total energy savings attained with PSO-OMRC model in nano coated room was about 25.2%. The nano coat on interior walls of room C resulted in high energy savings. PSO-OMRC controller leads to less energy consumption and maintained maximum thermal comfort for occupants. In different environments, various tests were carried out and identified the energy saving performance of the proposed PSO-OMRC controller. The total electrical power consumption of conventional model compared with PSO-OMRC using various occupancy models and represented in Fig. 13 . The 2 °C variations in SPT achieved an average of 3%\u20135% energy savings. Fig. 14 compares conventional model [45] discomfort and energy saving performance with various control methods implemented using PSO-OMRC. The ISO 7730 standard defines distinct thermal comfort levels for occupants and classifies the periods as such: PMV≤0.5 as comfort hours, PMV between 0.5 and 0.7 as discomfort, and PMV≥0.7 as significant discomfort for those in the room. The energy savings and discomfort attained by different occupancy control models using PSO-OMRC are shown in Fig. 15 . Fig. 16 represents the energy savings achieved using a thermal camera-based occupancy model with ordinary paint in room B and nano paint in room C. 5 Discussions In this paper, occupant measurement and microclimatic condition are used in PSO-OMRC model. Traditional methods used more number of sensors such as PIR sensors, CO2 sensors and other occupant sensors for occupant prediction. The prediction of SPT in HVAC often relies on occupant sensors accuracy. Errors in occupant sensing leads to inaccurate SPT. One of the main problems encountered during the design and the implementation of this PSO-OMRC was the selection of the sensor and measured occupant count. Initially PIR sensor is used for occupant measurement never performed during multiple entry of persons in room. In another method, RGB camera is used for occupant measurement, during low lighting conditions in meeting rooms such as during projector and flickering of lights and, the occupancy estimation accuracy is inaccurate. In next method thermal images are used for human body temperature detection, this method works better in low light conditions, and the accuracy for occupancy estimation was about 89.10%. When thermal camera is placed at correct angles the energy consumption was low. HVAC control based on human body temperature measurement based number of occupant in a room used for prediction of SPT. PSO-OMRC model in a nano coated room, the energy savings were further improved to 25.2%. A comparision of proposed and existing methods are in Table 8 . The performance of PSO-OMRC model is compared with traditional methods, and represented in Fig. 17 . The primary motivation of this study is HVAC energy efficiency and occupant comfort. HVAC systems account for a significant portion of energy consumption in buildings, and optimizing the setpoint temperature can reduce energy usage and associated costs. The setpoint temperature maintains comfortable indoor environment through accurate SPT prediction and ensures occupants are satisfied with the temperature without any discomfort. In HVAC systems, prediction of the setpoint temperature optimize the performance of the system, used for energy management systems and improves building energy efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance occupant comfort. HVAC setpoint temperature prediction based on occupant estimation and microclimatic conditions improves energy efficiency, occupant comfort, and indoor air quality and increases HVAC system efficiency. HVAC setpoint temperature prediction based on occupant estimation and microclimatic conditions using thermal cameras have several challenges that need to be addressed: such as accuracy, calibration, data processing, occupant detection algorithm and integration with systems. The major drawback of using thermal camera is the cost. Fig. 18 shows SPT prediction of HVAC using various machine learning models. 6 Conclusion HVAC systems consumes more energy in urban areas, high energy consumption contributes to a higher carbon footprint. An accurate predictive model to control the indoor temperature through an optimal setpoint is required. In this paper, a PSO-OMRC controller is proposed for HVAC system control. The PSO-OMRC analyses the real-time indoor temperature data for different rooms in a building in the context of thermal comfort and predicts SPT based on the occupants present in the room. Furthermore, less sensor data with low computational complexity is required, which is attained with PSO-OMRC. Three different occupant measurement models were presented and evaluated for accuracy and energy savings. Prediction accuracy utilizing PIR sensor and door sensor-based occupant measurement model achieved low energy savings. To improve accuracy, the thermal camera images are used for calculation of the number of occupants. The thermal image-based occupant measurement was 89.10% accurate and achieved energy savings of about 16.6% over the conventional method. PSO-OMRC used machine learning algorithms to predict SPT, and the results demonstrated that using PSO-GPR gives 96.8% accuracy with less MSE compared to other machine learning algorithms. Moreover, after applying a nanocoat in a room, a cool temperature is maintained for a long duration of time due to insulation, and thermal comfort is increased. In a thermal occupant measurement model and nanocoat inside the walls of the room, energy savings was about 25.2%. PSO-OMRC-based HVAC control provides accurate occupant measurement and optimal SPT prediction based on microclimatic data. The occupant measurement model and nanocoat on the room wall, combined with the PRO-OMRC controller in the HVAC system, demonstrate high comfort and increased energy savings. Further, the PSO-OMRC model with microclimatic data-based energy savings can be implemented in split air conditioners and window air conditioners in home.

        "dc:description": "In this paper, PSO-OMRC model is proposed for heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system. The PSO-OMRC predicts SPT in HVAC for energy saving and thermal comfort of persons in room. PSO-OMRC used data collected from temperature, humidity, PIR, and thermal camera sensors in HVAC installed rooms for SPT prediction. In existing HVAC systems, SPT is constant and consumes more energy. Moreover, SPT prediction using traditional machine learning algorithms considers various parameters such as room temperature, humidity and person count in room. Existing algorithms considers the above parameters for energy saving in HVAC and thermal comfort for persons, whereas other parameters such as room walls and ceiling temperature, human body temperature need to be considered for SPT prediction and for energy saving in HVAC. The PSO-OMRC model predicts the SPT based on number of occupants and microclimatic conditions such as environment temperature, humidity, room wall temperature and ceiling temperature. From experimental results, the utilization of the thermal image occupant model provides significant energy savings in the PSO-OMRC model. In nano coated room, PSO-OMRC model is evaluated with the implementation of a thermal image occupant model to improve energy savings, resulting in approximately 25.2% of energy savings while maintaining the level of thermal comfort.",
