The present study examined in a field condition a smart integration to the control of ventilation/AC/lighting, integrated with the use of a smart sensing network, embedded PIR/CO2 sensors, and environmental system modeling towards considerable savings of building-operational cost/energy while providing satisfactory thermal comfort and indoor air quality (IAQ). For approach demonstration, a typical office building with multiple zones was utilized as testbed. The study 1) investigated the integrational effect of embedded PIR/CO2 sensors with a smart sensing network on occupancy detection/estimation; 2) field-monitored the energy benefits of an integrated smart sensing/control network in building-operations; and 3) examined the feasibility of further energy reduction via environmental system modeling. Two types of demonstration tests were performed under similar occupancy patterns and weather conditions; a) Baseline Test (3-day) with a normal building-operation following ASHRAE 62.1-2016 requirements, and b) Case Study (3-day) with a smart network-based demand control. Results showed substantial enhancements in occupancy accuracy and energy savings (up to 45% of fan electricity and 36.5% of room cooling/heating energy). The new approach provided satisfactory or similar levels of thermal comfort and IAQ. It was analyzed that the use of the environmental system modeling could further reduce the building-operational energy via more detailed control of ventilation.

Around 39.7% of all U.S. energy use in 2018 was reported to be used by commercial buildings, residential housing and their residents [1], and 3/4 of that consumption was related to electricity [2]. 55% of all commercial building energy was consumed due to Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) and lighting (HVAC's portion is ~44%, based on the 2012 CBECS survey) [3,4]. Lighting takes the largest portion of electricity consumption in the U.S. commercial buildings at an estimated cost of $38 billion per year [5]. Among the 39.7% energy-use portion of the total U.S. energy mentioned above, consumed by commercial/residential buildings, only 1% energy reduction of this figure via any energy-efficient devices or methods can be translated into the saving of 496 million oil barrels (as of December 2017), which was known to encircle the entire world 10 times when placed next to each other. As a new era of building technologies is emerging, buildings nowadays are becoming more like an active pseudo-creature equipped with various sensing organs specific for airflow rates, energy use and efficiency, occupancy, temperature and humidity, etc. A recent report on intelligent buildings stated that due to recent advancements and investments in smart buildings, building control algorithms enabled the provision of data beyond energy-efficiency, which can change the status of operational efficiency and space utilization as well [6]. These data-rich and intelligent building environments are expected to emerge more in the near future as a necessity, rather than a novelty as the return on investment (ROI) from properly-applied BIoT and associated intelligent building technologies is getting shorter than any past eras (i.e. within 2\u20133 years), together with their lower implementation costs than ever. Also, the availability of these technologies is more ubiquitous than ever before. In a reasonable sense, the expected savings of building-operational costs from the implementation of proactive energy-management controls in mid-sized buildings were roughly estimated in the range of 10\u201325% [7]. Weng et al. [8] estimated 50% electrical energy savings via sensor-based demand control solutions based on their field experimental study. Goyal et al. [9] highlighted the importance of real-time occupancy measurements in configuring building systems with a high degree of energy-saving, derived from their field experimental evaluation. Pritoni et al. [10] emphasized the substantial energy-saving impacts of occupancy-responsive controls for currently unconstrained buildings with a high tendency of low occupancy. It has been anticipated that advanced building automation and control systems (for HVAC controls) can save more than 45% of typical HVAC energy [10-13]. However, the U.S. is facing a challenge of the actual low penetration rate of this technology in the actual market, especially in the small-to-medium-sized building categories [14]. The market penetration of HVAC building automation system (BAS) in small-to-medium buildings (<9290.3 m2; such as small offices, hospitals, retail stores, restaurants, etc.) is reported to be a mere 5% [3], though the number of buildings in this category constitutes 98% of the total building number in the U.S., comprising 65% of the total U.S. building floorplan. So, there is great potential in smart HVAC controls for this building sector as a future market. The owners and managers in this small-to-medium building category feel conventional building HVAC control systems and their implementation in their buildings less attractive; the required pieces for building automation systems such as dedicated servers, gateways, local controllers and a software license for the deployment of required sensors and end-devices do not scale according to the size of building. As a result, these components are considered as a big fixed cost for the adoption of automation control systems [14]. In addition, they tend to cost proportionally more for small- and medium-sized buildings than for the larger counterpart. In consequence, many buildings in this category have not enjoyed the benefits of cost and energy savings via automatic HVAC controls. Also, field demonstration research works on advanced building controls have been mostly performed in large commercial buildings because they are usually equipped with relevant required facilities such as variable-air-volume systems, not like other typical small-to-medium buildings [15]. There are several types of smart demand controls introduced in the literature; humidity-, CO2-, pollutant-, temperature-based, and motion detection-controlled [16]. Guyot et al. [16] reviewed 38 studies of this kind \u2013 both field and modeling. The RH-based control systems proposed a promising energy-saving performance in modeling studies up to a 60% energy reduction, but showed a trivial (~6%) or no improvement in three actual field studies [16]. On the other hand, the CO2-based systems showed a promising result (up to 60% savings) in both modeling and experimental studies. Also, combinatorial approaches such as RH + motion detection (55% total energy saving) [17], CO2 + motion detection (60% reduction of the convective heat ventilation loss) [18], CO2 + RH (38\u201339% savings via elaborated control algorithms) [19], or CO2 + Absolute Humidity (35% savings of fan electricity consumption) [20] showed great potential in energy savings. Among them, one modeling study presented a surprising result of up to a 96% reduction in fan electricity consumption when sensors were combined and occupancy was accurately detected via light switch in a small space like toilets and bedrooms [21]. Based on the crucial role of the accurate estimation of occupancy in smart demand controls and the corresponding energy-saving potential, there were few studies trying to improve the occupancy accuracy in a large field setting by utilizing motion detection and CO2 sensors (though this specific combination has high cost-effectiveness). For these reasons, a quite practical and affordable implementation approach for \u201caccurate occupancy\u201d-based demand controls is called for, by utilizing easily-deployable and low-cost smart sensing techniques and actual field demonstration, especially for small-to-medium buildings. The present demonstration case study investigated in a real small-sized building the effectiveness and potential of a smart method for the control of ventilation, air conditioning [22] and lighting targeted mainly for small- and medium-sized building applications. Also, the study attempted to achieve the practicality in approach deployment and the cost via simple concise system integration, by wisely utilizing a smart sensing network or BIoT, embedded passive infrared (PIR)/CO2 sensors, and environmental system modeling toward sustainable building-operations while providing comfortable thermal conditions and acceptable indoor air quality (IAQ). The objectives of the present study were (1) to look into the benefits of the complementary integration of embedded CO2 sensors and a detection-based smart sensing network on occupancy detection/estimation; (2) to field-monitor the energy benefits of utilizing a smart control module with the integrated smart sensing network in operating lighting and HVAC systems deployed in an existing office building [23]; and (3) to suggest a way of further reducing energy consumption in future building-operations via the addition of an environmental system modeling method to the integrated sensing network [24]. 2 Experimental design and methodology 2.1 Overview of the integration and investigation methods For approach demonstration, SyracuseCoE, a LEED Platinum office building with multiple zones, was utilized as a testbed, having a relatively high level of nearby traffic pollution due to its intersectional location between two U.S. interstate highways. A low-cost and highly configurable smart sensing system (tailored for small-/medium-sized commercial spaces) was configured in the testbed (5.944×10.516×3.048-m high), which contains CO2 and PIR motion sensors embedded in each sensing module (Fig. 1 ). Eight modules and a head node for wireless network controls were deployed in 8 different zones (individual cubicles) of the testbed. Each cubicle was configured as an independent zone equipped with individual floor air supply, duct control, and environmental monitoring. For advanced occupancy detection and estimation, we had initiated the development of a synergistic fusion method using CO2 measurements and motion detection information together [25] and raised the degree of completeness in the current study. To implement an effective and economic occupancy-based demand control with far-efficient deployment practicality, a brilliant control module based on the LabVIEW visual programming language (open source, so no additional license fee was required) was developed in a form of web-based building management system (BMS) to communicate with the existing building control system via BACnet protocol, to connect/communicate wirelessly with required sensor modules and, based on the sensor input, to make control decisions to be overridden on the main building control system via the communication channel. This approach does not require additional gateways, servers or software license for approach implementation, which substantially enhanced the deployment practicality at a far reduced cost. Two types of experimental test campaigns were performed under similar occupancy patterns, conditioned outdoor air and weather conditions; (a) 3-day Baseline Test with a normal building-operation complied with the ventilation requirements of ASHRAE 62.1\u20132016 [26], and (b) 3-day Case Study with the smart occupancy-based demand control implemented via the integrated smart sensing network. During the baseline test, normal office occupancy was allowed and recorded by participating occupants. The similar occupancy profiles were deployed during the case study as well for the result comparison (See the occupancy hours in Table 3 and Fig. 8; other profiles can be found in Supplementary Document Figures. S1-S3). The mechanical ventilation of a research room in the building operated from the morning (7:00 a.m.) to the afternoon (5:00 p.m.). Cubicle temperatures were controlled at 24.0ºC (75.2ºF) for summer and 22.0ºC (71.6ºF) for winter. The cubicle relative humidity (RH) was maintained at 40\u201350% RH. Before each test, all clocks in the system, and the testing/monitoring devices were synchronized according to the official NIST time [27]. Power, energy consumption, and building environmental parameters in each zone (such as space temperature and humidity, supply air fan speed for each cubicle, supply air temperature and humidity before and after cooling/heating coil for each zone, CO2 and pollutant concentrations) were monitored and data-logged at every minute during the tests. 2.2 Instrumentation and HVAC systems For motion detection, a commercial-grade PIR sensor with a viewing angle of 150° was used in each sensing module, and for an augmented detection of human presence, a chip-type CO2 sensor (ELT Sensor Corp., accuracy ±50 ppm or 3% of measured values with a range of 0\u20132000 ppm) was embedded in each PIR sensing module, forming a network module to be inter-connected wirelessly. A balometer or air capture hood (TSI Incorporated, accuracy 3% of measured values) was used for the calibration of the rates of airflow supplied from each zone's floor diffuser and for the commissioning of test settings in the testbed. PpbRAE Plus (RAE Systems, 1-ppb accuracy) was used for measuring the concentration levels of volatile organic compounds (VOC) in the air of the testbed during the demonstration experiments (Supplementary Document Figure S7). Other environmental measurements such as temperature, RH, flow rate, and energy consumption were measured and recorded by utilizing the existing building monitoring system equipped with commercial-grade power meters and monitoring sensors. The testbed facility has two dedicated HVAC systems (utilizing electricity for variable speed fans and equipment, and natural gas for cooling and heating via water cooling/heating coils); one for pre-treating the outdoor air into the building (The first Air Handling Unit or AHU-01) and the other for providing conditioned air to each zone (or cubicle) in the testbed (AHU-02). AHU-01 is equipped with an enthalpy wheel for energy-efficiency, but not operated during the current testing to investigate the suggested method's specific energy savings. The HVAC systems are capable of providing up to 12 individually controlled zones. A dedicated software system (Carrier i-VU) is used to monitor and measure various environmental parameters under different operations and occupancy conditions. Each zone in the testbed is equipped with sensors for temperature, relative humidity, and total VOCs, plus a controller to enable the occupant to set the desired temperature and ventilation airflow rate. Occupants of the zones in this facility can adjust their own thermal environments to suit their comfort preferences. To achieve individual control, each zone has its own Air Treatment Module (ATM - a European technology). The air treatment modules are located one floor below the testbed, with the conditioned air ducted to individual testbed zones through an under-floor plenum. Each ATM contains a fan unit, a heat exchanger with hot/cold water connections, an ultraviolet irradiation filter and a control module, and is capable of supplying controlled amounts of conditioned air to each zone. The outside air is first conditioned via the first AHU before being fed to the individual ATM's. The return air to the zones in the testbed is exhausted from a return vent located approximately 2.7-m high at the northwestern corner in the testbed. When under automated control, the ATM fan speed and supply air temperature are dictated by a control unit comparing the temperature setpoint in the zone. The zone temperature is measured by a sensor (Carrier Maestro Controller) located on the front partition wall of each zone enclosure (Fig. 4). This also serves as the thermostat for each ATM. When the setpoint is changed to a value different from the zone air temperature, the fan speed is increased or decreased to supply the airflow, and the hot/cold water valves are opened to change air temperature as required to change the zone air temperature. These units are capable of supplying airflow ranging from 16.5 to 70.8 L/s (35\u2013150 cfm) and maintaining supply air temperatures as low as 14.9 °C (58.82°F) during cooling and as high as 43.3 °C (109.94°F) during heating. The temperature and the percentage of fresh air can be adjusted over a wide range in each ATM. 2.3 Ventilation and occupancy designs 2.3.1 Ventilation design The breathing zone outdoor airflow (Qbz) required by the ASHRAE 62.1\u20132016 standard was defined and calculated as: (1) Q bz = E z × Q oz = E z × F pz × Q pz = R p × P z + R a × A z where, Ez represents the zone air distribution effectiveness (0.8 in this study due to the floor diffuser used for cool air supply); Qoz the zone outdoor airflow (L/s); Fpz the primary outdoor air fraction (0.1 or 10% for satisfactory thermal comfort); Qpz the zone primary airflow; Pz the number of people in the occupied zone during the usage hours; Az represents the net floor area of the ventilation zone (m2); Rp the outdoor airflow rate required per person (2.36 L/s per person which is 5 cfm/person for offices as defined in ASHRAE 62.1\u20132016), and Ra the outdoor airflow rate required per unit area (0.3048 L/s\u2022m2 which is 0.06 cfm/ft2 for offices as in ASHRAE 62.1\u20132016). The final zone primary airflow (Qpz) for each cubicle's thermal comfort was determined to be 49.08 L/s (104 cfm) in this case, considering each cubicle's floor area (5.208 m2 or 56.06 ft2) and the required zone outdoor airflow for each cubicle (4.908 L/s or 10.4 cfm). 2.3.2 Occupancy design To generate reasonable typical office occupancy patterns for demonstration tests, the occupancy diversity factors for weekdays recommended in ASHRAE 90.1\u20132004 [28] were utilized. There were two types of tests performed \u2013 baseline and case study. For the baseline tests, the research team recruited participants and gave them a full freedom and right to use a testing cubicle for each person in the testbed according to their own usage styles and working schedules with some guidelines (i.e. asking them to stay in their space at least during 10:00\u201311:00 a.m. and 3:00\u20134:00 p.m., and have lunch during noon-2:00 p.m.). Then, the actual occupancy profiles were recorded during their working hours. These recorded occupancy profiles were deployed again during the corresponding case study for the comparison of the collected environmental conditions and the resulting energy monitoring measurements between the two. 2.4 Data fusion method for occupancy detection/estimation There have been several attempts to combine multiple sensing modalities for the improvement of human presence detection [29\u201337]. Among possible existing/emerging technologies for human presence such as digital photo imaging, infrared thermal imaging, and ultrasonic/WiFi wave distortion detection (Table 1 ), we strategically chose the modality of \u201cCO2+motion sensor\u201d because we saw its potential to maintain a relatively high level of accuracy with quite a low implementation cost (<$0.32/m2) and the possibility to challenge this modality's well-known drawbacks possibly raised by other researchers. The drawbacks are the possible long latency and not-instantly changing response of CO2 measurements in real situations. Also, some may be concerned about the dramatic degradation of the modality's detection accuracy depending on occupancy scenarios. There were also some systemic challenges to overcome for success such as a high risk in the sensor development and integration due to intrinsic uncertainties in the quality of low-cost sensor components, large variations in field conditions (layouts, occupancy patterns, and room airflow patterns), and refining requirements of a decent data fusion algorithm under a field condition. To overcome the typical drawbacks of the CO2 modality, we wisely placed the sensor in each zone within 0.5 m to the corresponding occupant (as a countermeasure against the latency issue) and below each occupant's breathing zone (for the improvement of the responsiveness; CO2 is a heavier gas than the air). Passive infrared (PIR) sensors can sense human presence by detecting occupants\u2019 arm and body motion within a minute, but often generate false-negative detection errors when occupants take a rest, have little movement or are outside the sensor's field of view. CO2 sensors can sense human presence by measuring the level of the concentration of, or the rate of concentration change of CO2 generated by occupants. It is typically known that they require a longer time for the CO2 level to increase for detection. However, this is not always the case for all test settings. CO2 sensors alone are also prone to false-positive detection errors because of the fluctuation of the CO2 level in a space due to background level fluctuation, movement of occupants, and airflow pattern in the space. In a mutually complementary manner, a combined sensor module can minimize and eliminate especially false-negative detection errors, by utilizing totally different detection characteristics of low-cost PIR and CO2 sensors. PIR sensors are mostly accurate for motion detection, but suffer from false-negative errors when occupants have little or no motion. When occupants stay in one place, the local CO2 concentration increases, which can be detected by even a low-cost CO2 sensor. Besides, relative humidity and temperature can affect the variations of the sensors\u2019 sensitivity and reliability over time, be utilized to mitigate the variations of low-cost sensor readings, and provide human presence related information for fusion algorithms. The accurate and fast motion detection by PIR is supported mostly as true for the indication of human presence, but the transient signal of PIR from 1 (motion) to 0 (no motion) should be re-checked by filtered CO2 measurements to decide whether it comes from any false-negative events (due to almost no or small movements) or actual occupant vacancy. Human vacancy events should be confirmed only by the support of both PIR and CO2. In this way, most false-negative detections could be corrected within a given required interval of detection. The detection algorithm augmented by CO2 measurements is detailed below. According to a previous study [38], buildings with packaged HVAC equipment and no powered exhaust are pressurized slightly above the prevailing ambient pressure; therefore, offices generally experience exfiltration rather than infiltration. In this regard, the present study used a modified concentration relationship for each cubicle (or zone) as follows: (2) V e f f · C ˙ z = N ( t ) · R ˙ C O 2 + Q e x f · ( C s − C z ) + Q r · ( C s − C r ) where, Veff represents the effective zone volume (m3); N(t) the number of occupants (to be determined; it should be an integer); dot of RCO2 the CO2 metabolic rate of an adult individual working in a seated position (mg/s; it can be converted from 1.2 met); Qexf the exfiltration airflow rate (m3/s); Qr the return airflow rate (m3/s); Cz the measured CO2 concentration in a given zone (mg/m3); Cs and Cr indicate the CO2 concentration levels in supply and return ducts (mg/m3), respectively (to be calculated based on measurements). Fig. 2 represents a ventilation model for each zone. Please note that the model was used to augment the human detection in each zone, not the occupancy estimation in each zone and that the overall detection results for all target zones comprised the final occupancy result. There is recirculation airflow between the inlet duct and the exhaust duct as shown in the figure. The following equations can be drawn through simple mathematic manipulations using the considered parameters: (3) x ˙ = F · x + w where, x ≡ [ N C s C r C z ] T ; F ≡ [ 0000 A · R ˙ C O 2 V e f f A · Q e x f + Q r V e f f − A · Q r V e f f − A · Q e x f V e f f B · R ˙ C O 2 V e f f B · Q e x f + Q r V e f f − B · Q r V e f f − B · Q e x f V e f f R ˙ C O 2 V e f f Q e x f + Q r V e f f − Q r V e f f − Q e x f V e f f ] ; A ≡ ( Q s − Q a ) · η v Q s − ( Q s − Q a ) · ( 1 − η v ) ; B ≡ ( 1 − η v ) · A + η v ; η v = C r − C s C z − C s ; w: Model uncertainty vector; C s _ m e a s u r e = Q a · C a + ( Q s − Q a ) · η v · C z _ m e a s u r e Q s − ( Q s − Q a ) · ( 1 − η v ) ; and C r _ m e a s u r e = ( 1 − η v ) · C s _ m e a s u r e + η v · C z _ m e a s u r e , these two values can be calculated from the measured zone CO2 concentration (Cz_measure ) as indicated. The problem for occupancy detection using a fusion method of CO2 measurements and motion detection information can also be established in a form of hypothesis statements as follows, assuming CO2 concentration measurements at each sampling time are independent and identically distributed: (4) H 0 : V e f f · C ˙ z = Q e x f · ( C s − C z ) + Q r · ( C s − C r ) H 1 : V e f f · C ˙ z = N ( t ) · R ˙ C O 2 + Q e x f · ( C s − C z ) + Q r · ( C s − C r ) where, H0 represents no occupancy in a given zone, and H1 means that occupants are in the zone. The hypothesis testing for this case is whether the measured concentration profile follows one of the above patterns. However, the problem can be simplified as follows, knowing that the probability density function (pdf) for H0 can be modeled as white Gaussian noise with a certain mean (in the present study, 720 mg/m3 or around 400 ppm, which was the averaged CO2 concentration level of the outdoor air measured during the tests), and a monotone non-decreasing likelihood ratio testing can be established even though the pdf for H1 is not known specifically (can be established as an empirical cumulative density function utilizing a set of actual measurements): (5) H 0 : C ˙ z ( k ) < η , k = 1 , 2 , \u2026 , n H 1 : C ˙ z ( k ) ≥ η Then, an N-P test (Neyman\u2013Pearson) for the case can be formulated, setting a level of type I error (False Positive). To apply this hypothesis testing, the measurements of a selected zone with three levels of white Gaussian noise were utilized, and the detector performance results were evaluated for the use of the occupancy detection/estimation algorithm for actual demonstration tests. The threshold value was determined by utilizing collected measurements from a preliminary field test. Although the value can be different on a case-by-case basis depending on given environmental structures and conditions, the proper threshold value can be determined in simple ways. Also, one may use different threshold values for H0 and H1 due to the big difference of CO2 concentration measurements between the two cases (when vacant vs. during occupied). 2.5 System integration and design of experimental test campaigns 2.5.1 System integration The system integration with the existing BMS for the current approach was constructed in a practical and fast manner by utilizing very smart and concise system integration. Any advanced demand controls can be practically tested in this way and later smoothly adopted/deployed by building owners and designers for their buildings in a persuasive and compelling way. We did not overhaul the existing BMS, or fully integrated necessary sub-components or sensing modules for the approach demonstration, which would be costly and time-consuming. Rather, by utilizing built-in BACnet communication channels, the required sensing part for the approach was augmented in a practically effective way. And then, the whole augmented building system for the approach was constructed and prepared for demonstration in a time-efficient and cost-effective way (i.e. established within a month for the current study, which would be a year project if traditional implementation methods were employed). For the practical and effective demonstration of demand-based ventilation/lighting controls in a real building, two sensors having complementary features (i.e. one method's drawbacks can be made up for by the other method's advantaging features in terms of accuracy, estimation and error propagation pattern) were selected and integrated in an embedded way, which were PIR and CO2 sensors. LabVIEW visual programming language was utilized to construct the control module for approach demonstration, communicating with the existing BMS and the fused sensor network, and making control decisions and sending the decisions back to the existing building system (Fig. 3 ). The present study modified and augmented a commercial-grade low-cost wireless sensing network by embedding an affordable PIR-based motion detection sensor and a chip-type embedded CO2 sensor in each module. This type of sensing approach was dynamic, real-time, adaptable and highly configurable for small-/medium-sized commercial spaces. Each module can interact with occupants and communicate with each other via radio-frequency (RF) wireless channels for the enhancement of the total BMS functionality and the improvement of energy management efficiency. No special wiring or remodeling was required for the deployment. 2.5.2 Field-experimental design The field testbed used for the current study consisted of 12 cubicles, configurable of 12 individual zones, with the size of 5.944 × 10.516 × 3.048-m high (19.5\u2032×34.5\u2032×10.0\u2032 high). Each cubicle was divided by partitions having a height of 1.72-m (5.64\u2032). Each cubicle can be configured as an independent zone equipped with a floor diffuser, damper and fan controls, temperature/RH sensors and controls, a computer and a monitor, and a desk and a chair (Fig. 1). Among the 12 cubicles, the present study used 8 inner cubicles (areas less affected by outdoor radiation and temperature changes) for the deployment of 8 modified sensing network modules. Fig. 4 shows the schematic diagram of this field space. For the demonstration of the usefulness and effectiveness in the integration accuracy and energy saving by the approach, we designed two types of experimental test campaigns as described in Section 2.1. To provide a clean initial environment during the case study, we employed the normal building-operation without the consideration of occupancy status especially for the period of 7:00\u20138:00 a.m. Each type of test was conducted three times (3-day baseline and 3-day case study), starting at 7:00 a.m. in the morning and ending at 5:00 p.m. in the evening. During the tests, CO2 concentration levels at the return duct and total VOC concentration measurements were collected. The green stars in Fig. 4 indicate the sampling locations of VOC measurements: at Cubicle C for Pattern 1 test, at the return duct for Pattern 2 test, and at Cubicle J for Pattern 3 test. Cubicles G and J were found to be occupied most of the time during the tests. Table 2 details the summary of the test settings experienced during the tests. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Accuracy improvement of occupant presence Results (Fig. 5 ) showed that the PIR detection-only method for occupancy detection had a difficulty of False-Negative (indicating vacant even when there was an occupant in a target zone), whereas the CO2 method for occupancy detection had a tendency of False-Positive (saying occupied when no occupant was present due to residual CO2 effects from nearby zones; refer to the periods of 8\u20138:30 and 14:30\u201315:30 in the figure of the CO2 method result). These characteristic drawbacks call for the need of a smart fusion of the two methods characteristically-different. Among several feasible methods (Table 1), the complementary use of CO2 measurements integrated with motion detection information turned out to substantially enhance the accuracy of occupancy detection/estimation in the most cost-effective way. As an example in Fig. 6 , the overall estimation accuracy for a representative pair of the test cases was found to be up to 98.3% (via the new fusion approach) from 53.4% (via the PIR-only methodology, which level was what a normal commercial-grade PIR sensor could provide). More details can be found in Supplementary Document (Figures. S4 and S5). The occupancy accuracy was calculated based on the comparison of the recorded occupancy estimation data at every minute with the actual occupancy report filled in by participants for each case from the beginning to the end of each test day. For instance, if there are five failures in the occupancy detection/estimation (for five one-minute intervals) during a target period or the whole testing day (8 a.m. to 5 p.m.), the accuracy is to be calculated as 1 - 5/[(17-8)×60+1] = 0.991 or 99.1%. 3.2 Operational energy savings and thermal comfort/IAQ The rationale behind the 3-day comparison approach during a hot summer is based on the insight obtained from a previous study. Previously, the research team has established a whole building simulation model for the testbed building via DesignBuilder, Energy+ and CONTAMW and performed comprehensive building energy and air pollution simulations. The team found that any ventilation reduction strategies for energy-efficiency based on demands such as occupancy or CO2 level [39,40] are effective only during very hot and very cold weather seasons [22]. During cool and mild climatic seasons, ventilation reduction methods are not effective in overall building energy saving. Rather, it was found that more ventilation during these seasons could save more energy, in the way of reducing overall cooling/heating loads. In this regard, the team decided to perform demonstration tests during very hot summer days to see the effectiveness of the new approach in building energy saving. These actual energy measurements can be later utilized to extrapolate energy-saving details over the whole year based on actual weather data and previous whole building energy simulation results. Three sets of tests ensure a two-third (66.7%) probability that the averaged measurement among the three is more accurate than a single trial measurement. The averaged value in this way would have a greater chance to be closer to the true effectiveness value of the new control approach than a single trial. Based on the advancement in occupancy detection/estimation, the smart-sensing occupancy-based approach could save ~45% of fan electricity and ~36.57% of room cooling/heating energy of the testbed, compared with a normal building-operational practice following the requirements of the relevant standards \u2013 ASHRAE 62.1\u20132016 and 90.1\u20132004 (Table 3 ). Table 3 summarizes energy consumption details monitored for different energy use categories during the demonstration tests, including outdoor air conditioning energy, equipment, lighting, and room conditioning energy. Power consumptions for individual categories were measured during the tests via power meters and data-loggers (Fig. 7 ). Any weather and occupancy normalization techniques were not used. Instead, each pair of baseline and case study tests was tried to be carried out under similar occupancy patterns deployed in each corresponding pair (as indicated in the quite similar occupancy person hours or Occ∙h in Table 3). For similar weather conditions, we carefully selected the test days for each pair, based on solid weather forecasts before testing each pair. Also, the outdoor air was pre-conditioned by AHU-01, cooling down up to 26.67ºC (80ºF) before supplied to the ATM modules for individual zones. Lighting and room cooling/heating energy were found to be the major parts of the whole building-operational energy. As for lighting, there was a little saving margin via the advanced building control. The reason for this is that even though there was only one occupant left in the test room during a specific testing period, the full strength of lighting was provided. If there was no occupant in the whole testbed, the lighting was fully turned off. Instead of the on/off lighting control, a lighting intensity control of illuminance based on occupancy would be a better way in harvesting any possible residual lighting energy. Based on the advancement in occupancy detection/estimation using a synergistic integration of two different types of sensors, the current smart sensing/control approach was found to save considerable energy of fan electricity and room cooling/heating. The fan electricity savings were almost proportional to the vacant density of occupants (represented by vacancy person hours in Table 3; i.e. Correlation coefficient R-value = 0.748 for the 8\u201315 period); around 0.9 of the energy savings ratio over the vacancy ratio for this category means a little overhead operational-energy and small energy leaks (The value of 1.0 of this ratio means that the reduction level of occupancy is fully translated to the level of energy savings. For example, a 50% occupancy reduction from 8 to 4 persons can lead to 50% energy savings for a target category). However, the cooling/heating energy had a somewhat different story (i.e. Correlation coefficient R-value = 0.741 for the 8\u201317 period); the savings ratio was 0.59 (except for the outlier of the second pair) over the vacancy ratio as in Table 3. The reason behind the lower saving of room cooling/heating energy than that of the fan electricity was because, for the case study with a demand control, the maximum cooling was almost always needed from the beginning of zone air conditioning when zones were vacant for a while and then occupied by the participants. During the baseline tests, however, a mild continuous cooling was observed for room conditioning during most of the testing period. Another reason behind this less energy-efficiency is due to thermal leakage among different zones. The tested zones were not completely separated by solid walls, but by top-opened partitions (Figs. 1 and 4). In this configuration, thermal leakage and pollutant concentration exchange can easily happen, which makes the current case more challenging than in normal fully-separated multi-zone testbeds. For this reason, one may expect higher energy-efficiency in room cooling/heating if the current tests were performed in a normal fully-separated testbed via the aforementioned integrational/control technique. By the way, the outlier ratio value of 0.81 of the second pair was largely induced by the lower outdoor temperature conditions of the case study than the baseline's as seen in Table 2 (≥3ºC difference). During the case study, the smart sensing approach was observed to provide a satisfactory or a similar level (per ASHRAE 55 [41]) of thermal comfort and IAQ (compared with the baseline) during the periods when each zone was occupied. ASHRAE 55 defines satisfactory thermal comfort zones for summer and winter depending on clothing, airspeed, temperature, RH and radiation levels (Fig. 8 ). Considering that the testbed was located in the inner circle of the middle section of the target office building, not facing any exterior walls or windows, the surrounding surfaces of the testbed had a small temperature difference from the mean air temperature (<1ºC). With these considerations, the resulting thermal comfort conditions for the baseline and the case study were obtained based on ANSI/ASHRAE 55\u2032s psychrometric chart [41] and plotted as shown in Fig. 8 (with <0.1 m/s airspeed and ~0.5 clo of the clothing thermal insulation during the summer season). The baseline tests maintained a temperature range of 23.5\u201325.56ºC and an RH range of 45.3\u201355.2% RH indoors during the test periods. On the other hand, the case study could provide indoor temperatures of 23.5\u201325.67ºC and humidity conditions of 40.7\u201349.1% RH when zones were occupied by the test participants. Both cases could provide a satisfactory level of thermal comfort. However, there was a slight transition in a decreasing manner along the axis of RH level for the case study, indicating that the maximum cooling found in the case study, when zones were occupied and ventilation started for zone air conditioning, might take away more water vapor from the indoor air than what the mild continuous cooling did during the baseline tests. Both types of actual demonstration tests indicated that the total VOC concentration levels measured by ppbRAE were maintained below 80 ppb most of the time during the tests or when zones were occupied. Both test cases provided a similar level of satisfactory IAQ in terms of the VOC level measured by the device. 3.3 Further energy savings via CO2/VOC correlation During the last decade, there have been growing attention and several academic attempts in developing reasonable model predictive controls (MPC). MPC is known as an effective method to design sequences of control inputs for optimizing an objective function (e.g. minimal building-zonal energy), considering defined parameters and forced constraints and utilizing a building system model and sensor data of building system inputs and disturbances (e.g. occupancy, outdoor weather, solar gain, etc.). The main purpose of this approach is to extract the most efficient control actions in optimizing building energy use, finding an optimum controller for different situations, and also managing energy use from different available sources of energy in micro-grids and buildings [24,42]. It was observed that there was a reasonable correlation of CO2 measurements with VOC levels in the air of the tested space. Similar to the MPC concept, the environmental system modeling (ESM) utilizes the baseline environmental data (such as typical emission rates, zonal temperature changes with and without ventilation, etc.) of a given space collected via BIoT, and establishes a correlational relationship of CO2 measurements from the network with the prevailing VOC concentration levels in the air (Supplementary Document Fig. S6) as a further attempt toward energy saving. Through the current study, the use of ESM could further reduce the building-operational energy via more detailed and smart control of required ventilation. In the current test case, one test zone was found to be occupied most of the time during the tests except for the lunchtime. Even though the energy saving comes from the occupancy-based demand control, more energy can be harvested by providing the required ventilation intermittently as long as IAQ and thermal comfort conditions are met within satisfactory ranges based on the monitored environmental information: CO2, T and RH. The monitored information collected from the sensing network posed a possibility of intermitted ventilation even during the occupied period, not touching any problematic ranges of IAQ and thermal comfort. By utilizing the collected data, it was found that when a zone was occupied with no ventilation, the zonal temperature increase was in the range of +0.083ºC/min and the decrease level of zonal temperature, when ventilation started due to occupancy, ranged within −0.028 to −0.067ºC/min. If a temperature increase of 0.083ºC/min (when zones are occupied without ventilation) and a temperature decrease of 0.056ºC/min due to cooling from ventilation are assumed from the observation of building environmental data, we may operate ventilation in an intermittent way such as 30-min ventilation and 20-min rest even for the occupied period as long as there is no problematic issue in thermal comfort and IAQ. Based on the observed CO2/VOC correlation, 1350 mg/m3 of CO2 concentration (750 ppm) can be a reasonable target value for IAQ in the current testing case, which could be a good indication maintaining less than 50 ppb of VOC levels measurable by ppbRAE most of the time during the demonstration tests in the target testbed. To check the concentration level and feasibility of the operation of this new type of intermitted ventilation in comparison with a normal CO2-based demand control method, an existing building IAQ analysis tool (CONTAMW) was utilized based on the collected data. The eight-zone building model (similar to the actual testbed setting as in Fig. 4) was used in this analysis. Two occupants with the same behavioral characteristics occupied each assigned zone with the same environmental characteristics during 7:00\u201312:30 p.m. and 1:30\u20135:00 p.m. Fig. 9 shows the ventilation control profiles and the corresponding resulting concentrations of CO2 for the new method and a normal demand control (The setpoint of CO2 concentration was 1350 mg/m3 or 750 ppm). Even though there was a sharp increase in the CO2 level during the occupied period with no ventilation, the new intermittent ventilation method based on the baseline environmental information from the ESM could still satisfy the set IAQ level due to the short suspension of ventilation. Both methods could maintain acceptable IAQ and thermal comfort. However, the new method could save further ventilation energy on top of the savings from the smart occupancy-based demand control thanks to the reduced duty cycle from 100% to 60% during the occupied period. 3.4 Potential implications and limitations The use of an integrated smart sensing and control system with the augmented information on temperature, occupancy, power consumption, and pollutant concentration levels via surrogate will enable the reduction of ventilation rate and save a considerable amount of lighting and HVAC system's cooling/heating energy while meeting indoor environmental quality requirements. The current approach has high efficiency and low-cost features, easy to install, manage and deploy in commercial, residential and institutional buildings. It will facilitate new/existing buildings (especially, small-to-medium-sized) in adopting demand-based ventilation controls while meeting the IAQ requirements per ASHRAE Standard 62.1\u20132016 [26] in highly energy-efficient and management cost-effective manners. There are several potential implications of the proposed approach for relevant stakeholders and end-users in the building sector. With the energy-to-dollar conversion of $0.15/kWh, a web-based smart BAS (a deployment cost of ~$8 per square meter with a target module cost of $0.32/m2) can extract a $4.51 annual saving on utilities per every square meter area (which is especially for the current case study; this value lies typically in the range of $2.15\u20134.30/m2 annually via traditional BASs with the deployment cost of $26.91\u201380.73/m2). This cost-benefit will be amplified as application buildings are scaled up, almost lightening the small portion of the fixed cost of the current approach. Besides the expected expense reduction of building utilities, the smart BAS approach can generate another monetary benefit, which is the increase of building property value equipped with the smart system. This benefit is expected thanks to the improved working/managing environments to stay and work and its future-proof readiness potential, attracting, supporting and satisfying occupants in the buildings in terms of cost, comfort, and IAQ. Also, this smart integrational approach will provide a breakthrough for developing, demonstrating and commercializing future HVAC building automation systems and products that will be specifically targeted at the small-to-medium-sized building market. The embedded web-based building automation solution is practically scalable. For building system integrators, owners and facility managers of small-to-medium buildings, the embedded building management solution with a deployable wireless network will lower the barrier-to-entry for adopting their own building automation systems which were otherwise hard to be justified based on their building size when other traditional BMS systems were considered for this small-to-medium building category. As the embedded web-based BMS approach reduces the costs of dedicated gateways, servers and software license required, there will be many viable applications that will increase the return of investment, shortening the payback period of the building automation system employment especially for small-to-medium buildings. Moreover, the embedded web-based BMS allows a system operator to supervise and manage remotely several small buildings such as retail stores maintained by a single owner, increasing the cost-effectiveness of a BMS system both in the installation and during the operational phase as well. The BMS with embedded gateways offers a more energy-saving opportunity than systems with traditional controllers because it is more interoperable and can be integrated in a better combinatorial way with other smart sensors and control products. Thanks to its easily-deployable wireless capability, the smart BMS can greatly reduce labor and other installation costs in performing wiring and maintenance works. Still, it provides a similar level of energy-saving potential based on traditional demand-based controls (expected from typical expensive BAS systems), but with a far less cost and implementation period. For policy makers, as smart BAS systems with deployment practicality facilitate a building-level centralized HVAC control (enabling the optimization of HVAC performance, comfort, and energy usage), policy makers can make a huge difference by encouraging and incenting more open and interoperable technology architectures. On the other hand, there are some approach limitations careful in mind. When scaled up to larger commercial spaces than the small office case like in the current study, the location of the sensing/networking modules becomes important, which should be lower than occupants\u2019 breathing zones and close to the occupants as possible as they can for the best performance. For some building applications, this best location requirement may not be sufficiently met due to their large space configuration or installation practicality. For a scale-up application, some communication congestion issues may arise due to the expected high volume of calls from many end-devices simultaneously. Also, the communication security issues among deployed wireless devices for a scale-up application should be considered more in depth and delicately refined with advanced network security technologies or via the utilization of secure commercial cloud systems or services. 4 Conclusions The complementary use of motion detection and CO2 measurements with a smart-sensing network could substantially enhance the occupancy detection/estimation accuracy (53.4% → 98.3% via the new fusion approach), the efficiency of building automation system implementation/deployment (within a month for a year project), and the energy-effectiveness of occupancy-based demand controls (up to 45% energy savings) in a real building application. The study also observed that CO2 had good potential as a practical indicator of related VOC levels (especially, VOCs from occupant-dominant sources). Results showed the potential of a smart sensing/control network for future building improvements/developments toward sustainable and healthy environments. The study findings also provided previously unavailable field experimental data and new insight into the smart-sensing network for future building sustainability. As energy prices are rising and the financial/social agreements on the importance of energy-efficiency are getting established strong, the market opportunity of smart sensing/control technologies for building automation will shine brighter and become more prominent in the near future than now.

        "dc:description": "The present study examined in a field condition a smart integration to the control of ventilation/AC/lighting, integrated with the use of a smart sensing network, embedded PIR/CO2 sensors, and environmental system modeling towards considerable savings of building-operational cost/energy while providing satisfactory thermal comfort and indoor air quality (IAQ). For approach demonstration, a typical office building with multiple zones was utilized as testbed. The study 1) investigated the integrational effect of embedded PIR/CO2 sensors with a smart sensing network on occupancy detection/estimation; 2) field-monitored the energy benefits of an integrated smart sensing/control network in building-operations; and 3) examined the feasibility of further energy reduction via environmental system modeling. Two types of demonstration tests were performed under similar occupancy patterns and weather conditions; a) Baseline Test (3-day) with a normal building-operation following ASHRAE 62.1-2016 requirements, and b) Case Study (3-day) with a smart network-based demand control. Results showed substantial enhancements in occupancy accuracy and energy savings (up to 45% of fan electricity and 36.5% of room cooling/heating energy). The new approach provided satisfactory or similar levels of thermal comfort and IAQ. It was analyzed that the use of the environmental system modeling could further reduce the building-operational energy via more detailed control of ventilation.",
