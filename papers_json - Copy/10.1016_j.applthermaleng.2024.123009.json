A significant amount of energy consumed by building environment control systems is used for dehumidification. However, the conventional cooling dehumidification method is energy-intensive as the low required dew-point temperature and reheating. In this paper, two different new building environment control systems based on cooling dehumidification under positive pressure are proposed, which can realize dehumidification with a natural cooling source at ambient temperature. The cooling dehumidification model under positive pressure is proposed and verified by experiments, and the errors are within\u202f±\u202f4.16\u202f%. Influences of pressure ratio and cooling source temperature on system performances are analyzed by simulation. The result shows that proposed systems can achieve the dehumidified air with a humidity ratio of 8.18\u202fg/kgDA and a temperature of 20℃, and the dehumidification energy efficiency of new systems can achieve 6.11\u202fkg/kWh. At a cooling source temperature of 18\u202f°C and pressure ratio of 1.6, the total dehumidification rate of the system can reach 19.49\u202fg/s. Reheating in front of the expander can reduce the detrimental dehumidification proportion to 0\u202f%. The coefficient of performance (COP) of the new system can reach 6.26, which is superior to other dehumidification methods.

However, the global energy landscape is encountering profound challenges, garnering heightened scrutiny and attention within contemporary society [3]. Amidst the challenges posed by energy scarcity, considerable attention has been directed towards energy technologies [4], renewable and clean energy production and storage [5], advanced materials and composites [6,7], and environmental concerns [8]. Within these domains, energy efficiency emerges as a pervasive issue of interest, garnering widespread attention from both national and local governments. It is imperative for these entities to enhance energy efficiency, curtail emissions, and bolster production to align with sustainable development objectives. The building energy consumption accounts for about 50\u202f% of the entire energy consumption of society in China [9]. However, if building energy policies and technologies remain, by 2050, total energy consumption of China will increase by 170\u202f% and carbon dioxide emissions will increase by 100\u202f% compared with 2010[10]. It becomes a necessity to save energy by reducing the energy consumption of building [11,12]. Currently, energy conservation measures in building construction, guided by technological innovation, primarily follow two main directions. The first involves ensuring that the design of new building structures prioritizes energy efficiency, incorporating appropriate building envelope materials to reduce energy consumption related to building environment control systems [13,14]. The second direction focuses on optimizing the building environment control systems of existing building structures, recognized for their considerable potential in energy savings [15,16]. Research indicates that through comprehensive renovation of the building environment control systems in public buildings, there is a notable reduction in energy consumption per unit area, by at least 11.77\u202f% compared to pre-renovation levels [17]. This underscores the pressing need to investigate and implement more energy-efficient methods for controlling building environments. A conducive thermal and humid building environment stands as a paramount factor influencing the quality of the building environment and plays a pivotal role in meeting human demands for thermal comfort [18,19]. The establishment of an optimal thermal and humid building environment not only ensures human well-being but also enhances overall productivity. Nevertheless, the energy consumption of dehumidification accounts for 20\u202f%-40\u202f% of the entire energy consumption of building environment control systems, indicating a significant potential for energy savings [20,21]. Consequently, it is imperative to undertake research and development in pursuit of an efficient building environment control method. Numerous dehumidification methods have been proposed and applied in building environment control systems. Among these, cooling dehumidification stands out as a typical approach, wherein excessive moisture in the ambient air is mitigated through cooling coils, followed by reheating the air to achieve the desired temperature. Over the years, researchers have concentrated their efforts on enhancing structural designs, optimizing components, and refining operational strategies within the air supply system. Guo et al. [22] introduced a geothermal recycling system designed to effectively recover waste heat for simultaneous mine cooling and dehumidification, thereby enhancing energy efficiency by 20\u202f% compared with the conventional system. Chen et al. [23] conducted an investigation into a hybrid process that connects the indirect evaporative cooler (IEC) and the existing mechanical vapor compression (MCV) in tandem, which can yields a reduction in the humidity ratio of outdoor air by 0.5\u20134\u202fg/kgDA. Shahzad et al. [24] proposed a water droplet intervened IEC system using a thin aluminium foil in the air channel that can boost heat transfer from supply air to working air. This innovation enhances heat transfer from supply air to working air, resulting in an overall Coefficient of Performance (COP) of 10, where the dehumidification system COP is approximately 5. Kone et al. [25] proposed a new system, termed the dual air handling unit system, designed to address the considerable latent load characteristic of tropical regions. This method saves up to 13.2\u202f% more energy than traditional air-conditioning systems while maintaining occupant thermal comfort. Zhuang et al. [26] proposed a novel adaptive full-range decoupled ventilation strategy to reduce the excessive consumption of energy during dehumidification, which can provide enhanced thermal performance throughout the entire range of internal load and weather conditions while the initial cost is even lower than the recommended ventilation strategy. The literature shows that the cooling dehumidification method offers the advantages of straightforward operation and ease of control [27]. However, the advancement of cooling dehumidification is impeded by inherent challenges. Achieving the targeted humidity ratio necessitates cooling the air below the supply air temperature, consuming up to 50\u202f% of the total energy consumption, particularly in tropical climates [28,29]. Furthermore, this method demands low-temperature cooling sources within the range of 5℃ to 10℃, which imposes stringent requirements on the chiller [28]. Additionally, the process requires reheating to elevate the air temperature to the designated set value, resulting in large energy consumption [30,31]. The utilization of chillers, refrigerants, evaporators, and other components further contributes to increased costs and complexity in system structure. Instead of applying the conventional cooling dehumidification method of lowering the temperature of moist air to the dew point, an alternative strategy involves increasing the dew point of air via pressure elevation. Xia et al. [32] proposed an electroplating wastewater treatment system that applied an air compression expansion cycle to condense moist air and recover the wastewater under the positive pressure. This method enables the complete separation of salt and water, achieving a notable system efficiency ratio of 7.13\u202fkg⋅kWh−1. Moon et al. [33] studied the compression-expansion type dehumidification systems that can provide dehumidified air with dew point temperature down to −40℃. This method enables the complete separation of salt and water, achieving a notable system efficiency ratio. The rationale behind employing cooling dehumidification under positive pressure can be logically substantiated through research conducted in various fields. Notably, this approach can be effectively integrated into building environmental control systems. Instead of relying on a chiller system with stringent standards, a natural cooling source operating at ambient temperature can adequately cool and condense air under positive pressure. Besides, there exists potential to recover the heat from compressed air to reheat dehumidified air, which is significant energy consumption in the conventional cooling dehumidification method. The expander enables compressed air to release energy, compensating the power consumed during the compression process. These features collectively highlight the advantages of employing cooling dehumidification within building environmental control systems. Notably, in the majority of research focused on cooling dehumidification under positive pressure, the outlet air temperature of the expander consistently falls below freezing, indicating the condensation of air within the expander. This occurrence poses potential risks, such as pipe blockage and turbine damage, thereby jeopardizing the secure functioning of systems [34]. The excessive or inadvertent removal of the moisture from the air in an indoor environment, referred to as detrimental dehumidification, has been overlooked in prior studies. In summary, cooling dehumidification plays a crucial role in the application of building environmental control systems. However, the enormous energy consumption associated with latent heat load and the reheating underscores the need for investigating a reliable and energy-efficient air dehumidification method. In this paper, two different new systems based on cooling dehumidification under positive pressure are proposed, which uses natural cooling source to condensate the moist air under positive pressure. Unlike conventional cooling dehumidification methods that focus on cooling moist air below its dew point, the proposed dehumidification method elevates the dew point temperature actively by increasing pressure, reducing the requirement on cooling source. Furthermore, the heat of compressed air can be further utilized. This approach holds the potential to significantly reduce the energy consumption of dehumidification systems. In comparison to conventional cooling dehumidification methods, proposed systems offer the possibility of achieving building environmental control without the reliance on a large chiller. Experimental validations are conducted to verify the accuracy of the system model. Influences of pressure ratio and cooling source temperature on the dehumidification performance and energy efficiency of systems are analyzed. The occurrence of detrimental dehumidification in the two systems and a comprehensive performance comparison between them are discussed. Furthermore, new systems are compared with other humidity control systems to evaluate their energy-saving capabilities. These analyses contribute a fresh perspective to the field of air dehumidification in building environment. 2 The new building environment control systems based on cooling dehumidification under positive pressure 2.1 System principles 2.1.1 System structure In order to acquire the reliable and energy-efficient air cooling dehumidification process, two different new building environment control systems based on cooling dehumidification under positive pressure are developed in this paper, which is shown in Fig. 1 . The air compression expansion system for building environment control (ACES) is shown in Fig. 1 (a). ACES consists of a compressor, an expander, an air-to-air heat exchanger, a dehumidifier, a cooling source and a motor that designed to share a shaft with the compressor and expander. At first, the air from user side enters the compressor, where its pressure and temperature are raised. Then, the air under positive pressure is preliminarily cooled in the air-to-air heat exchanger. Next, the air is cooled by the cooling source and the water condensation of air is collected and discharged in the dehumidifier. After that, the air flows through the expander, where both its pressure and temperature are reduced. The work output from the expander can supply a certain amount of energy to compensate for the compression process by shaft. Finally, outlet air of the expander is transferred to hot side of the air-to-air heat exchanger and is heated to the required temperature. Accordingly, the air with certain humidity and temperature is supplied to the user side. Compared with ACES, the air compression expansion system with reheating before the expander for building environment control (ACES-RE) is shown in Fig. 1 (b), which has an additional air-to-air heat exchanger 1 after the compressor. The air-to-air heat exchanger 1 can both facilitate the cooling of compressed air and provide heat for the saturated air before the expander, so that no condensation will occur in the expander. 2.1.2 Thermal process of systems Fig. 2 illustrates the thermal process of different cooling dehumidification systems. The air process in conventional cooling dehumidification systems is shown in Fig. 2 (a). The graph reveals that, in the case of conventional cooling dehumidification systems, the moist air undergoes a subcooling process (1\u20132) to reach the dew point and satisfy the required specific humidity for air supply. Subsequently, it undergoes a reheating process (2\u20133) to elevate the subcooled air to the desired temperature for air supply. In contrast, systems proposed in this study elevates the dew point temperature by compressing air, thereby reducing the energy required for cooling dehumidification. Simultaneously, the heat generated during air compression is utilized for reheating the supercooled air, as is shown in Fig. 2 (b) and (c). In comparison to ACES, ACES-RE differs in that it utilizes the heat from compressed air to reheat the air before expansion (5\u20136). This eliminates liquid droplet condensation within the expander, thereby preventing mechanical damage. Furthermore, the multi-stage utilization of residual heat from compressed air assists in alleviating cooling pressure on the cooling source. The thermal analysis presented above indicates that the new building environment control systems based on cooling dehumidification under positive pressure have the following advantages: 1) Cooling dehumidification under positive pressure increases the dew point of the air, which can promote the dehumidification and increase the required cooling source temperature. 2) The air-to-air heat exchanger after the expander can preheat the outlet air of the expander, which can reduce energy waste caused by overcooling and reheating in the conventional cooling dehumidification method. 3) The air-to-air heat exchanger before the expander can heat inlet air of the expander, thus avoiding detrimental dehumidification and realizing stable and reliable cooling dehumidification under positive pressure. 2.2 Modeling of systems 2.2.1 Design constrains and assumptions Following design constrains and assumptions are made to simplify the calculation: 1) Losses of heat and pressure in the pipeline are ignored [35]. 2) The mass flow of air throughout the process remains constant [36]. 3) The moisture in the air is fully precipitated and discharged in the dehumidifier [37]. 2.2.2 Models of different components 1) Compression process The inlet air parameters of the compressor are tailored to correspond with the prevailing conditions within the building environment. During the compression process, the humidity ratio of the air remains unchanged. Firstly, the compression process can be regarded as an isentropic compression process[38]. The outlet air temperature of the compressor can be obtained by Eq. (1). (1) T com , o u t , i T com , i n = ( P r ) k - 1 k Then, the isentropic efficiency of the compressor is defined as the ratio of ideally isentropic energy consumption to non-isentropic energy consumption, which can be achieved by Eq. (2). (2) η com = h com , o u t , i - h com , i n h com , o u t - h com , i n where the parameter h com , o u t , i is ideal enthalpy of outlet air of the compressor, which can be acquired by humidity ratio, temperature and pressure of air in table of moist air thermodynamic properties. Finally, the energy consumption of compressor can be calculated by Eq. (3). (3) W com = ( h com , o u t - h com , i n ) · ( 1 + w com , i n ) · m da where the parameter w com,in and m da is the inlet air humidity ratio of the compressor and dry air mass flow rate in the system, respectively. 2) Air-to-air exchanger In this research, the heat exchanger employed is of the shell-and-tube type. The cooling source flows in the inner tubes, while the moist air flows around the outer surface of the tubes. Heat transfer occurs between the two fluid streams through the tube walls. The heat and mass transfer analysis of the air-to-air heat exchanger must be considered as a combination of sensible and latent heat [32,38]. The heat transfer rate of the air-to-air exchanger can be calculated by Eq. (4). (4) q hex = h hex , h , i n - h hex , h , o u t - ( w hex , i n - w hex , o u t ) · h hex , w An overall heat exchanger efficiency is used to model the air-to-air heat exchanger, which is defined by Eq. (5). (5) η hex = q hex q hex , max where the parameter q hex , max represents the maximum heat transfer rate of the heat exchanger, and it can be obtained by Eq. (6). (6) q hex , max = max ( h hex , h , i n - h hex , h , o u t , min , h hex , c , o u t , max - h hex , c , i n ) where the parameter h hex , h , o u t , min is the minimum outlet air enthalpy of the heat exchanger hot side. It can be obtained when outlet air temperature of the heat exchanger hot side is equal to the value of the cold side inlet. The parameter h hex , c , out , max is the maximum outlet air enthalpy of the heat exchanger cold side. It can be obtained when the outlet air temperature of the heat exchanger cold side is equal to the value of the hot side inlet. 3) Expansion process The expansion process of moist air is similar to the compression process. Without considering the pressure loss in the system, the inlet air pressure of the expander is equal to the outlet air pressure of the compressor. The pressure and temperature of the moist air decrease during the expansion process. If the inlet air is saturated, the air will condense during the expansion process. Firstly, the expansion process can be regarded as an isentropic expansion process[32]. The outlet air temperature of the expander can be obtained by Eq. (7). (7) T exp , i n T exp , out , i = P r k - 1 k Then, an isentropic efficiency is used to express the non-isentropic process[32]. The isentropic efficiency of an expander, which can be obtained by Eq. (8), is defined as the ratio of non-isentropic energy consumption to isentropic energy consumption. Different from the adiabatic expansion process of an ideal gas, the adiabatic expansion of moist air involves a division of the enthalpy drop. A portion of the enthalpy drop is converted into axial work, while the remaining segment contributes to the heat absorbed during the condensation of water within the moist air. Consequently, in the calculation of expansion work, it becomes imperative to deduct the latent heat associated with water condensation throughout the expansion process. (8) η exp = h exp , i n - h exp , o u t - ( w exp , i n - w exp , o u t ) · h exp , w h exp , i n - h exp , o u t , i - ( w exp , i n - w exp , o u t ) · h exp , w where the enthalpies can be obtained by pressure, humidity and temperature of the air. The parameter h exp , w represents the enthalpy of condensed water in the expander, which brings an enthalpy drop but does not produce expansion work. Finally, the energy compensation produced by the expander can be calculated by Eq. (9). (9) W exp = [ h exp , i n - h exp , o u t - ( w exp , i n - w exp , o u t ) · ( h exp , w + r exp , w ) ] · ( 1 + w exp , i n ) · m da where the parameter r exp , w is the latent heat of condensed water in the expander, which can be obtained by pressure, humidity and temperature of the air. To improve the rationality of calculation, the enthalpy drop caused by condensed water must be eliminated from the expansion work. 4) The dehumidifier and the cooling source The dehumidifier and the cooling source are designed to achieve the air dehumidification under positive pressure. The moist air is cooled to certain temperature by the cooling source and the condensation of air is removed in the dehumidifier. The dehumidifier employed in this study is a cooling heat exchanger connected to a natural cooling source at ambient temperature, and the condensed water can be separated and discharged in this dehumidifier. As a heat and mass transfer module, the dehumidifier and the cooling source can generate dehumidified air. The heat transfer rate of the cooling source can be obtained by Eq. (10). (10) q coo = h coo , i n - h coo , o u t - ( w coo , i n - w coo , o u t ) · h coo , w The heat transfer amount can be calculated by Eq. (11). (11) Q coo = q coo · ( 1 + w coo , i n ) · m da 2.2.3 Simulation logic Based on the above calculation modeling, parameters of each state point in the systems and other results can be calculated by iteration. In conducting the simulations for the theoretical model, a computational approach is opted, leveraging the capabilities of MATLAB software. The numerical solution derived from the theoretical framework was implemented using this tool, allowing us to simulate and analyze diverse scenarios related to dehumidification processes in building environments. The specific simulation logic diagram is shown in Fig. 3 . 2.2.4 Operating conditions The operating conditions involved in the analysis are given in Table 1 . The pressure of air achieved after compression ranges from 150\u202fkPa to 320\u202fkPa. The subsequent experiments conducted are also consistent with these pressure parameters. 2.3 Experiment 2.3.1 Description of the experimental system Based on system principles and moist air physical properties, the experimental system of cooling dehumidification under positive pressure is designed and constructed to validate the accuracy of the system model under positive pressure. The schematic diagram of the experimental system is presented in Fig. 4 . The experimental system consists of a moist air pretreatment module and a cooling dehumidification under positive pressure module. Specifications of key components are listed in Table 2 . The picture of the experimental system is shown in Fig. 5 . The measuring instruments and precision are presented in Table 3 . The moist air pretreatment module, including a heat gun, a humidifier box, a condenser and a plenum box, is designed to obtain moist air of certain temperature and humidity ratio. The ambient air is heated at the module inlet by a heat gun to acquire sufficient capacity to contain moisture. Water is sprayed from above in the humidifier box, wetting the air to be supersaturated. Then the air is cooled in the condenser to the designed temperature. The pretreated air is fed into the plenum box to balance the phases in the moist air. The cooling dehumidification under positive pressure module, including a compressor, a cooler, two dehumidifiers and a relief valve, is designed to analyze the condensation characteristics of moist air under positive pressure. In this process, air with certain humidity and temperature enters the compressor and is compressed to designed pressure. In addition, the system mass flow rate is determined by the compressor gas inducing rate. Then, the air flows into the cooler to exchange heat with the cooling source and moisture in the air condenses under positive pressure. Water at 27℃ is used as a natural cooling source to condense the moist air. Dehumidifier 1 is configured to separate condensed moisture from saturated humid air, and the collected condensate is analyzed to assess the dehumidification efficiency. To ensure thorough separation of moisture by dehumidifier 1, preventing any leakage of droplets due to excessive airflow velocity, dehumidifier 2 is introduced. During the experiments, the presence or absence of moisture in dehumidifier 2 is observed to verify that the air subjected to positive pressure condensation dehumidification is indeed saturated humid air, rather than carrying droplets as in the case of oversaturated air. This meticulous validation enhances the accuracy of experimental results. The relief valve at the system outlet can ensure safe operation of the experimental system and control the pressure. 2.3.2 Experimental method The purpose of this experiment is to measure the actual effectiveness of cooling condensation under positive pressure in a shell-and-tube heat exchanger at a specific cooling source temperature. In the experimental study, saturated humid air of a specific temperature is first obtained through a moist air pretreatment module. Subsequently, the saturated humid air is drawn into a compressor and compressed to a specific pressure. Under positive pressure, the humid air undergoes heat exchange with the cooling source in the shell-and-tube heat exchanger, achieving cooling condensation under positive pressure. Due to gravity, the condensed water flows along the air duct into the gas\u2013liquid separator. The condensed water is separated and collected from the air by dehumidifier 1 for measuring the dehumidification amount of the system over a period of time. During the experiment, the condensation phenomenon in dehumidifier 2 is observed. If droplets are present, it indicates that some droplets have not been captured by dehumidifier 1 and have flowed out of the system with the air. In this case, the measurement results are inaccurate, requiring adjustment of the opening of gas\u2013liquid separator and re-experimentation. If no droplets are observed, it indicates that the system is removing saturated humid air effectively. The compressor used in the experiment can reach a maximum pressure of 7\u202fMPa, and the system pressure is determined by the pressure relief valve. The experiment was conducted for a pressure ratio range of 1.2 to 3.0, with 19 sets of experiments performed. Each experiment was repeated 5 times, and the average value was taken as the experimental data. A series of raw data were obtained, including the dehumidification capacity of the system, the temperature and humidity of the humid air outlet, and the flow rate. 2.4 Evaluation index The energy consumption of the system is the deviation between power consumption of the compressor and energy compensation of the expander, which can be represented by Eq. (12). (12) W net = W com - W exp The coefficient of performance (COP) is normally designated as the main performance indicator of building environment control systems. The cooling capacity of proposed systems can be expressed by the enthalpy difference of air between the inlet and outlet of systems since air is both refrigerant and refrigerant carrier in an open air compression expansion cycle. Therefore, the COP of building environment control systems based on cooling dehumidification under positive pressure can be obtained by Eq. (13). (13) COP = ( h in - h out ) / W net The total dehumidification rate (G) is introduced to reflect the dehumidification ability of systems, which can be obtained by Eq. (14). (14) G = ( w sys , i n - w sys , o u t ) · m a The dehumidification energy efficiency (DEE) is proposed as the significance performance index of an air dehumidification system. It can be expressed by the total dehumidification rate to energy consumption per unit time as Eq. (15). (15) DEE = ( w sys , i n - w sys , o u t ) · m da W com - W exp = G W net 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Validation By adjusting the compressor and the relief valve, the system pressure ratio changes from 1.2 to 3.0. The outlet air humidity ratio of the experimental system is obtained by temperature, pressure and relative humidity. Each operating condition is repeated in several sets to obtain the average of data. Partial experimental data are presented in Table 4 , and the whole set of experimental results is presented in the appendix. In response to the experimental conditions, a systematic mathematical model was employed to conduct simulation studies, which were then juxtaposed with the experimental results. Comparing the outlet air humidity ratio of experimental system with that of simulation result, it can be concluded that the errors are within\u202f±\u202f4.16\u202f%, as illustrated in Fig. 6 . Therefore, the model is proved to be reliable and can predict the humidity of dehumidified air under various pressure ratios. 3.2 Dehumidification capacity of systems On the basis of the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE standard 55), specific criteria must be adhered to for air conditioning systems to achieve thermal comfort in building environments, namely maintaining a temperature range of 22 to 27 ℃ and a relative humidity of 40\u201360\u202f%[27]. The outcomes of numerous simulation iterations, ensuring compliance with the specified building environment standards, are presented herein. Influences of pressure ratio and cooling source temperature on the outlet air humidity ratio of ACES are illustrated in Fig. 7 (a). It is evident that the outlet air humidity ratio of ACES increases with the cooling source temperature. Simultaneously, an increase in the pressure ratio results in a reduction of the outlet air humidity ratio of ACES. This observation suggests that lowering the cooling source temperature and elevating the pressure ratio contribute positively to the dehumidification effectiveness of the system. The thermodynamic principle underlying this phenomenon is that the dew point temperature is dependent on both the water vapor content and the pressure within the air. For moist air with a specific humidity, a higher atmospheric pressure corresponds to an elevated dew point temperature, signifying that moist air is more prone to reaching saturation and thereby achieving dehumidification. Furthermore, for moist air at certain pressure, a lower temperature of the cooling source results in a lower final temperature attained, consequently reducing humidity of the moist air. Therefore, the pressure ratio and the temperature of the cooling source are two pivotal factors in systems that influence the dehumidification efficiency. Under specific operational conditions (P r\u202f=\u202f1.6 and t coo\u202f=\u202f32℃), ACES demonstrates its capability to produce dehumidified air with a humidity ratio of 6.55\u202fg/kgDA (rh sys,out\u202f=\u202f44.4\u202f% when t sys,out\u202f=\u202f20℃ and p sys,out\u202f=\u202f101\u202fkPa), highlighting its commendable dehumidification capacity and its minimal requirements for pressure ratio and cooling source temperature. A parallel trend is observed in the influence of pressure ratio and cooling source temperature on the outlet air humidity ratio of ACES-RE, as depicted in Fig. 7 (b). It can be observed that ACES-RE can achieve dehumidified air with 8.18\u202fg/kgDA (rh sys,out\u202f=\u202f55.3\u202f% when t sys,out\u202f=\u202f20℃ and p sys,out\u202f=\u202f101\u202fkPa) when operating condition is P r\u202f=\u202f1.6 and t coo\u202f=\u202f18℃. In contrast, a desiccant evaporative combined air conditioning system yields dehumidified air at 13.4\u202fg/kgDA with a chilled water temperature of 16\u202f°C [39]. This underscores the fine dehumidification capability of both systems, satisfying the demands of the building environment. In conclusion, the findings affirm that both ACES and ACES-RE exhibit robust dehumidification capabilities, effectively meeting the stringent requirements of the building environment. Fig. 8 elucidates influences of pressure ratio and cooling source temperature on the total dehumidification rate of systems. The data reveal a clear trend: both systems exhibit a decrease in total dehumidification rate as the cooling source temperature increases and as the pressure ratio decreases. Specifically, at a cooling source temperature of 18℃ and a pressure ratio of 1.6, the total dehumidification rate of ACES is 19.49\u202fg/s, while is 13.66\u202fg/s. In contrast, a cascade system with direct-contact cooling and liquid desiccant has a maximum total dehumidification rate of 10.83\u202fg/s in studied conditions. These rates are deemed highly effective for controlling the environmental conditions within buildings. In summarizing these findings, it can be stated that lowering the temperature of the cooling source alongside increasing the pressure ratio significantly enhances the dehumidification efficiency of these systems. The positive pressure enhances the dew point temperature of air, making it possible to facilitate the condensation of moist air by using natural cooling source. Besides, the analysis indicates that it is feasible to match the cooling source temperature and pressure ratio to meet the demand for dehumidification. Moreover, the conducted analyses indicate that it is feasible to strategically adjust the cooling source temperature and pressure ratio to fulfill specific dehumidification requirements. This ensures that proposed systems can be optimized to meet the diverse needs of building environmental control, thereby reinforcing the practical application and versatility of the ACES and ACES-RE systems in achieving desired indoor humidity levels. 3.3 System performances Fig. 9 (a) and (b) reveal the influences of cooling source temperature and pressure ratio on system COP. Notably, as the pressure ratio of the systems increases, there is a discernible decrease in the COP for both systems. This observed trend is attributed to the fact that, at a constant cooling source temperature, the work input rises proportionally with the escalating pressure ratio. However, this increase in work input occurs at a rate significantly surpassing that of the air enthalpy difference between the inlet and outlet of the systems. This is because compressed air, regardless of its initial state, is cooled to the same temperature by the cooling source, resulting in a lower enthalpy drop in heat exchanger under conditions of higher pressure compared to those of lower pressure. Consequently, the compensation proportion at the expander decreases, leading to an increase in input work. These thermal processes contribute valuable insights into the dynamic relationship between pressure ratio, cooling source temperature, and COP, providing a basis for optimizing the design and operation of dehumidification systems in the realm of building environmental control. Specifically, under conditions where P r\u202f=\u202f1.6 and the t coo\u202f=\u202f16℃, the system COP of ACES can reach 5.37, while that of ACES achieves a slightly higher COP of 5.75. In contrast, the COP of a dedicated outdoor air system assisted by isothermal dehumidification and evaporative cooling is 3.61 [40]. These findings demonstrate the excellent energy efficiency performance of proposed systems, indicating its potential to become a novel energy-saving building environmental control system. It offers new application possibilities for buildings facing energy consumption challenges in environmental control, such as in wood processing, pharmaceutical manufacturing, food preservation, data centers, and other scenarios. Influences of cooling source temperature and pressure ratio on the dehumidification energy efficiency of the systems, as depicted in Fig. 10 (a) and (b), elucidate significant trends. Notably, it is discernible that the dehumidification energy efficiency experiences a decrement with the increasing pressure ratio when cooling source temperature remains constant. This observed phenomenon underscores a critical aspect of system performance, wherein an increase in pressure ratio correlates with a diminishing efficiency in dehumidification energy utilization. Specifically, when P r\u202f=\u202f1.6 and t coo\u202f=\u202f16℃, the dehumidification energy efficiency of ACES can reach 5.80\u202fkg/kWh while that of the ACES can reach an even higher efficiency of 6.11\u202fkg/kWh. In contrast, A Brayton refrigeration air system utilized for electroplating wastewater treatment can enhance the system efficiency ratio to 2.18\u202fkg/kWh through the integration of a solar collector [38]. These findings serve to underscore the efficacy of the proposed building environmental control systems, particularly in their ability to achieve optimal dehumidification performance under positive pressure conditions, primarily relying on cooling-based dehumidification mechanisms. This elucidation not only provides valuable insights into the nuanced dynamics of cooling source temperature and pressure ratio but also highlights the potential of such systems to deliver efficient dehumidification solutions in the context of building environmental control. Such empirical evidence underscores the significance of these findings in informing the design and implementation of advanced dehumidification systems geared towards enhancing energy efficiency and environmental sustainability in building environments. 3.4 Detrimental dehumidification Detrimental dehumidification, characterized by excessive or erroneous moisture removal within the expander, poses a significant risk to system reliability and safety. In contrast, condensation that occurs in a heat exchanger or a dehumidifier is defined as beneficial dehumidification. Fig. 11 indicates the composition of dehumidification amount at different pressure ratio when t coo\u202f=\u202f18℃. It can be concluded that the dehumidification amount of ACES and ACES-RE increases as pressure ratio increases. Detrimental dehumidification occupies a certain proportion in ACES, and the detrimental dehumidification amount decreases with the increase of pressure ratio. In comparison, no detrimental dehumidification occurs in ACES-RE. This favorable outcome is attributed to the reheating effect facilitated by air-to-air heat exchanger 1, which elevates the inlet air temperature of the expander, thereby preventing the occurrence of dew point conditions. Consequently, ACES-RE emerges as an effective solution capable of circumventing detrimental dehumidification, consequently enhancing system operational security. Furthermore, while detrimental dehumidification persists within the ACES configuration, its adverse effects can be mitigated through the strategic adjustment of pressure ratios. This observation underscores the potential for optimizing system performance and reliability by modulating operational parameters, thereby ensuring effective moisture control while safeguarding against operational risks. In summary, the findings underscore the pivotal role of distinguishing between beneficial and detrimental dehumidification phenomena. Furthermore, the preceding discussion enhances the practical viability of applying the systems in engineering. This section also serves to raise awareness of detrimental dehumidification, a concern overlooked in contemporary engineering applications. 3.5 Comparison of the two systems In this section, a comparative analysis of two distinct dehumidification systems is undertaken to ascertain their respective performance disparities. In this case, cooling source temperature is set at 18℃, and pressure ratio of systems varied from 1.6 to 2.4. The comparison of outlet air humidity ratio of systems is presented in Fig. 12 (a). It can be observed that outlet air relative humidity of ACES ranges from 0.45 to 2.31\u202fg/kgDA, whereas that of ACES-RE spans from 5.34 to 8.04\u202fg/kgDA. These findings indicate a superior dehumidification efficacy for ACES compared to ACES-RE. Nevertheless, the outlet air relative humidity of ACES-RE, which ranges from 40\u202f% to 60\u202f%, is also able to meet the air supply demand according to ASHRAE standard 55\u20132017 [41]. This underscores the practical viability of ACES-RE in meeting ambient air quality requirements despite its relatively lower dehumidification efficiency. The comparison of total dehumidification rate of the two systems is shown in Fig. 12(b). According to the calculation, the average dehumidification rate of ACES is 36.2\u202f% higher than that of ACES-RE, which shows good dehumidification performance of ACES. However, it is imperative to consider the potential for mechanical damage associated with the operation of ACES, particularly when tasked with dehumidifying ambient air characterized by high humidity ratios. Consequently, while ACES demonstrates superior dehumidification capabilities, caution must be exercised regarding its operational suitability under conditions conducive to mechanical stress. Comparison of the system COP is shown in Fig. 12(c). It can be calculated that COP of ACES-RE is 14.2\u202f% higher than that of ACES on average. This enhancement can primarily be attributed to the reheating of air prior to its expansion within the system, a process which elevates the air temperature and consequently augments the work output during expansion. The COP of ACES-RE can reach 6.26 when t coo\u202f=\u202f18℃ and P r\u202f=\u202f1.6, indicating a good energy efficiency performance. Comparison of the system DEE is shown in Fig. 12(d). In this analysis, the DEE of ACES-RE is higher than that of ACES at first. However, the DEE of ACES-RE declines faster than that of ACES as the increase of P r. The maximum disparity of DEE between the two systems is 4.7\u202f% and the average difference (calculated by absolute values) is within 2.5\u202f%. In conclusion, the two systems have their own advantages. ACES can produce air with lower humidity ratio than ACES-RE. However, the inlet air humidity ratio of ACES cannot be too high, otherwise the detrimental dehumidification amount will be large, which means the dehumidification is completed at the expense of safe operation. Besides, the reheating feature of ACES-RE offers a notable advantage by mitigating the risks associated with detrimental dehumidification, ensuring the reliable operation of the dehumidification system. Further, ACES-RE is more energy-saving than ACES. 3.6 Comparison of different dehumidification methods To demonstrate performance advantages of proposed systems, COP and humidity ratio of supply air are compared with other building environment dehumidification systems. Parameters of dehumidification systems using different methods are listed in Table 5 . Parameters of ACES and ACES-RE are obtained when t coo\u202f=\u202f18℃ and P r\u202f=\u202f1.6, which is an optimization selection among the simulation cases. The COP of ACES and ACES-RE is 5.41 and 6.26, respectively. The humidity ratio of supply air in ACES and ACES-RE is 2.35\u202fg/kgDA and 8.18\u202fg/kgDA, respectively. It is worth noting that the parameters of the other systems included in the comparison were sourced from relevant literature. The investigation reveals the notable energy efficiency of the new building environment control systems based on cooling dehumidification under positive pressure. Specifically, The COP of ACES and ACES-RE surpasses that of their counterparts in the field. The hybrid fresh air handling system based on evaporative cooling and cooling dehumidification is a kind of conventional cooling dehumidification method [42]. Under similar system inlet air parameter with the proposed systems (36.0℃, 24.7\u202fg/kgDA), this system can reach the COP of 3.96 by recovering heat. However, a single-stage total heat recovery module consisting of a chiller and a spray packing complicated the structure of this system. With similar system inlet air parameter input, the COP of ACES and ACES-RE is 36.61\u202f% and 58.08\u202f% higher than that of the conventional method, respectively. Besides, ACES and ACES-RE can achieve a 73.89\u202f% and 9.11\u202f% lower humidity ratio than that of the conventional method, respectively. It is calculated that under optimum operating condition, ACES and ACES-RE consume 11.86\u202fkW and 7.88\u202fkW for the dehumidification of wet air per unit mass, respectively. While the conventional dehumidification method consumes 16.38\u202fkW in comparison. This signifies a remarkable 27.59\u202f% and 51.89\u202f% energy savings for ACES and ACES-RE, respectively, underscoring the significant advantages in energy conservation offered by these proposed systems in contrast to conventional dehumidification methods. Combination of multiple dehumidification technologies are used in mentioned literatures to improve dehumidification efficiency [43,44], but complex structures were unavoidable. Moreover, high requirements for material and mildew problem are defects of mentioned dehumidification systems. Vacuum-based membrane dehumidification systems have emerged as an alternative method for eliminating the need for heating or cooling sources [45]. Nevertheless, membrane dehumidification methods continue to face challenges related to suboptimal dehumidification performance and elevated costs, leading to a discernible gap in their practical application, as elucidated in Table 5. The liquid-desiccant dehumidification have been addressed with advantages in high efficiency and energy saving. However, systems proposed in this study demonstrate superior dehumidification rates and energy efficiency compared to liquid-desiccant dehumidification systems [46]. In conclusion, the proposed systems hold considerable significance relative to other published works. Primarily, this novel cooling dehumidification approach demonstrates efficient delivery of dry air, rendering it practicable for building environmental control. Furthermore, the proposed systems demonstrate commendable dehumidification efficacy and energy efficiency, superior to other dehumidification systems. Lastly, the proposed systems eliminate the necessity for structurally intricate and expensive chiller units, thereby presenting efficient energy preservation and wide application prospects. 4 Conclusion In this paper, new building environment control systems based on cooling dehumidification under positive pressure are proposed to solve the high energy consumption problem of conventional cooling dehumidification methods. Experiments are conducted to verify the model of air condensation under positive pressure. Influences of pressure ratio and cooling source temperature on the system performances are studied. Moreover, energy consumption and dehumidification capacity of systems are compared with other systems in literatures. The results indicate that: 1) Proposed systems based on cooling dehumidification under positive pressure are feasible and effectively for dehumidification with a natural cooling source at ambient temperature. When t coo\u202f=\u202f18℃ and P r\u202f=\u202f1.6, COP of ACES and ACES-RE can reach 5.41 and 6.26, respectively, and the humidity ratio of supply air in ACES and ACES-RE can reach 2.35\u202fg/kgDA and 8.18\u202fg/kgDA, respectively. 2) Reheating before the expander can avoid detrimental dehumidification effectively. No air condensation occurs in ACES-RE, ensuring the security and stability of the system. 3) Proposed systems exhibit superior performance compared with conventional dehumidification methods. DEE of ACES and ACES-RE can reach 5.80\u202fkg/kWh and 6.06\u202fkg/kWh, respectively, demonstrating good energy efficiency. 4) In future studies, comprehensive experimental research will be conducted on the system including the expander to explore its practical effectiveness in building environments. In addition, the actual condensation process of moist air is complex. Subsequent research will focus on experimental studies with different heat exchangers to investigate the condensation mechanism of moist air.

        "dc:description": "A significant amount of energy consumed by building environment control systems is used for dehumidification. However, the conventional cooling dehumidification method is energy-intensive as the low required dew-point temperature and reheating. In this paper, two different new building environment control systems based on cooling dehumidification under positive pressure are proposed, which can realize dehumidification with a natural cooling source at ambient temperature. The cooling dehumidification model under positive pressure is proposed and verified by experiments, and the errors are within\u202f±\u202f4.16\u202f%. Influences of pressure ratio and cooling source temperature on system performances are analyzed by simulation. The result shows that proposed systems can achieve the dehumidified air with a humidity ratio of 8.18\u202fg/kgDA and a temperature of 20℃, and the dehumidification energy efficiency of new systems can achieve 6.11\u202fkg/kWh. At a cooling source temperature of 18\u202f°C and pressure ratio of 1.6, the total dehumidification rate of the system can reach 19.49\u202fg/s. Reheating in front of the expander can reduce the detrimental dehumidification proportion to 0\u202f%. The coefficient of performance (COP) of the new system can reach 6.26, which is superior to other dehumidification methods.",
