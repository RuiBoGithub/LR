Increasing the penetration of renewable power in Denmark, demand-side flexibility is offered as a workable solution to hedge against the intermittency and volatility of renewable energy. In the residential sector, heat pumps are economic alternatives for district heating to unlock heat flexibility in response to renewable power availability. This paper proposes a novel economic approach to optimize the heat consumption of a single responsive building with multiple rooms. The suggested approach makes it possible to set different temperature zones for the rooms based on the occupancy patterns. To provide power system flexibility, an Economic Model Predictive Control (EMPC) is designed. The EMPC adjusts heat consumption in response to the electricity price. Integration of the heat flexibility into the power system, two types of heat flexibilities are investigated, including thermal inertia of rooms and thermal storage of buffer. To increase the applicability of the problem, real sensor data of a Danish residential building is used to estimate the constant parameters of the thermal dynamic. To achieve the aim, a model identification method is developed to estimate the constant factors based on the maximum likelihood function. Finally, the performance of the suggested approach is examined in response to the day-ahead electricity price of the Danish Electricity Market. The results showed that the suggested approach not only ensures power system flexibility but also decreases the energy consumption cost of the building up to 37% a week.

In Denmark, the penetration of renewable power has increased from 5.5 GW (44% of total available capacity) in 2015 to 6.4 (55%) in 2020 and is scheduled to reach 8.1 GW (60%) in 2025 [1]. To hedge against the intermittency of renewable power, demand flexibility is an alternative solution. The demand-side flexibility should be aggregated by the participation of all demand sectors, including residential [2], agricultural [3], industrial [4], commercial sectors [5], and electric vehicles [6]. In the Danish residential sector, the District Heating (DH) supplies 65% of Danish citizens. Considering 58.9% renewable power penetration in the Danish DH, a huge amount of heat flexibility can be unlocked [7]. To investigate the heat flexibility potentials, first of all, the thermal dynamics of heat consumers, e.g. buildings, should be determined. Then, an advanced controller is needed to adjust the heat consumption of the buildings in response to renewable power availability. This is the main motivation of this study. 1.2 Literature review In the literature, to study the flexibility potentials of the DH, three types of heat flexibilities are addressed. Thermal inertia of building [8], the flexibility of heat carriers [9], and the flexibility of thermal storage devices [10] are the most important types of heat flexibilities in a DH. The first type of heat flexibility is reflected in the thermal dynamics of buildings. This heat flexibility is unlocked by changing the indoor temperature within a comfort band. This is fast-response flexibility which can respond to Demand Response (DR) requests on short notice. In [11], this type of flexibility was investigated to provide up-/down-regulation when a power shortage/excess occurs in the supply-side. Moreover, it was addressed as a practical solution to facilitate the integration of renewable energies into the power system [12]. This flexibility can be extracted by the optimization of the supply and return water temperatures of buildings [13]. In this way, the thermal inertia flexibility is addressed as the regulation source of heating systems for wind power integration. Residents\u2019 comfort band determines the upper and lower thresholds of this flexibility [14]. The flexibility of the heat carrier emanates from the thermal dynamics of the distribution network. Generally, the key variables of the heat carrier, including temperature, differential pressure, and mass flow, can be adjusted to unlock heat flexibility. This flexibility may impose an additional cost on the DH. In this way, material fatigue in steel pipes [15], thermal stress, and pipe cracks [16] were reported in some studies. Therefore, it needs a quite complex controller to prevent unexpected aging. In [9], the flexibility of the heat carrier was addressed as a peak-shaving object. Also, this flexibility was suggested to decarbonize cities and their suburbs [17]. The heat flexibility of distribution substations is comprehensively characterized by [18]. Thermal storage devices are designed to provide heat flexibility to the DH. Based on the material, the thermal storage can be a water tank [19], chemical storage [20], aquifer [21], and borehole [22]. Regarding the time response criteria, thermal storage is classified into short-term and long-term storage. Short-term storage can provide power flexibility to the day-ahead [23], intraday [24], and balancing markets [25]. In the literature, hot water tanks were proposed as a practical solution to shift the power demand to off-peak periods [26]. Besides, shallow alluvial aquifers showed high potential in short-term flexibility [27]. In contrast, large-scale thermal storage was proposed to provide seasonal demand flexibility [28]. Apart from the types of heat flexibility, the controller is a key issue to unlock heat flexibility in a DH. Generally, the DH controllers can be classified into classic and advanced controllers [29]. The classic controllers normally aim to make a balance between demand and supply in a DH. Therefore, no energy system criteria are incorporated into the controller to respond to DR requests [30]. Adversely, the advanced controllers are able to optimize the heat demand/supply addressing the flexibility requirements of the energy systems, i.e. heat and power networks [31]. This type of controllers can incorporate the uncertainties associated with climate variables which have significant impacts on the DH operation [32]. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is one of the best practices of advanced controllers for flexible energy systems [33]. The MPC not only addresses the uncertain climate data but also considers the energy price to adjust the heat demand in response to renewable power availability. In [34], an Economic MPC (EMPC) was proposed to offer power flexibility to the electricity markets. 1.3 Paper contributions and organization This paper proposes a novel approach to unlock the heat flexibility of a Danish single-family house. In this way, the flexibilities of the thermal inertia of dynamics and thermal storage are investigated. To address heat flexibilities based on occupancy patterns, different temperature zones are defined for different rooms. Therefore, heat flexibilities can be optimized based on occupied and unoccupied hours. Moreover, the heat extraction from household appliances, e.g. cooking and refrigerator waste heat, are incorporated into the thermal dynamics. The approach is suggested in two steps as (1) model identification and (2) controller design. In the first step, real sensor data of a single-family building, including four rooms, is used to estimate the constants parameters of the thermal dynamics. In this way, a Continuous-Time Stochastic Model (CTSM) is developed to address the heat exchange between the internal envelopes. In the second step, a bi-level EMPC is suggested to optimize the heat consumption of the building in response to day-ahead electricity prices. In level one, the energy consumptions of floor pipes in rooms are optimized. Importing the heat demand of rooms to level two, the charging/discharging operations of the storage tank is optimized. To sum up, the main contributions of the study can be stated as follows: (1) Developing the thermal dynamics of buildings to set different temperature zones based on occupancy patterns. (2) Designing a bi-level EMPC to unlock the flexibility of thermal inertia and thermal storage. (3) Providing power flexibility in response to day-ahead electricity prices. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in section 2, the problem is formulated mathematically. In section 2.1, the model identification is stated considering the thermal dynamics and state-space. Section 2.2 illustrates thermal storage. In section 2.3, the objective function of the EMPC is presented. Section 3 describes the numerical studies and simulation results. Finally, section 4 concludes the suggested approach. 2 Problem formulation The approach is presented in two main sections. In the first section, the model identification is suggested to estimate the constant coefficients of the thermal dynamics for the residential building. In the second section, the bi-level EMPC is designed to unlock the flexibility of thermal dynamics and thermal storage in levels one and two, respectively. 2.1 Model identification In this section, a model-based approach for the thermal dynamics of buildings is developed to address different temperature zones. The thermal behavior is introduced in differential equations and state space. The former describes the thermal dynamics of buildings. The latter provides a mathematical structure to design heat controllers. Formulating the thermal behavior of the building, the stochastic grey-box model, i.e. CTSM, is used to identify the constant coefficients of the model. Thanks to the advances in metering technologies, the real sensor data is imported to the grey-box model to increase the applicability of the approach. 2.1.1 Thermal dynamic of Multi-room buildings In this section, a mathematical model for the thermal dynamics of buildings with multiple rooms is suggested. In the proposed model, the thermal dynamics of each room are modeled individually addressing the heat exchange to the adjacent rooms. The aim is to set different temperature zones for different rooms based on occupancy patterns. To achieve the aim, first of all, the conventional thermal dynamic of single-room buildings is presented. Afterward, the model is developed to address the internal heat exchange between adjacent rooms. Generally, the thermal dynamics of a single-room building can be stated as follows [35]: (1) C i × d T i dt = 1 R ie ( T e - T i ) + 1 R ih ( T h - T i ) + ( A w × P Sun ) (2) C e × d T e dt = 1 R ie ( T i - T e ) + 1 R ea ( T am - T e ) (3) C h × d T h dt = 1 R ih ( T i - T h ) + ( P Floor ) The differential equations (1)-(3), describe the 3-state thermal dynamics of a building with floor piping. In this model, Eq. (1), (2), and (3) illustrate the variation of the indoor, envelope, and floor temperature, respectively. This differential equation set addresses the thermal dynamics of a building that is surrounded by the outdoor temperature. In this model, the heat exchange is modeled only between envelopes and the outdoor environment. In other words, if one envelope is surrounded by another room or building, the thermal equation fails to address the heat exchange between the rooms. Fig. 1 depicts a schematic of a single-room house with the heat exchange between envelopes and the environment. Based on Fig. 1, the conventional house model, i.e. Eq. (1)-(3), only addresses the heat exchange between envelopes and the environment. Defining different temperature zones in multiple rooms of a building, the heat flux between the internal envelopes must be modeled. Therefore, to address the internal heat exchange, the conventional thermal dynamic is developed as the following general form: (4) C i r × d T i r dt = 1 R ih r × T h r - T i r + 1 R ie r × T e r - T i r 1 R iap r × ( T ap r - T i r ) + A w r × P Sun r (5) C e r × d T e r dt = T i r - T e r R ie r + ∑ r \u2032 = 1 r \u2032 ≠ r R T i r \u2032 - T e r R e r r \u2032 + ∑ a = 1 A T am - T e r R e ra (6) C h r × d T h r dt = ( T i r - T h r ) R ih r + P Floor r (7) C ap r × d T ap r dt = ( T i r - T ap r ) R iap r + P Appliance r The developed model Eq. (4)-(7) states the thermal dynamics of the room r which is surrounded by rooms r ' ∈ {1,2,\u2026,R} with R envelopes and outdoor environment with A envelopes a ∈ {1,2,\u2026,A}. Eq. (4)-(7) express the temperatures of indoor air, envelope, floor pipes, and household appliances in two consecutive times, respectively. In Eq. (4), the first term describes the heat exchange between the indoor air and floor pipes; the second term illustrates the heat exchange between indoor air and envelops; the third term is the heat exchange between indoor air and household appliances, and the fourth term shows heat extraction from solar irradiation. In Eq. (5), the first term denotes the heat exchange between indoor air and the envelope; the second and third terms explain the summation of heat exchange between the envelope and surrounding rooms, and between the envelope and surrounding environments with R and A envelopes, respectively. Eq. (6) illustrates the thermal dynamics of the heat extraction from the floor pipes. Finally, Eq. (7) models the heat extraction from household appliances, e.g. ovens and refrigerators. Note that the building is surrounded by the ambient air and the coupling of the floor to the ground is not taken into account. To clarify the suggested structure, Fig. 2 depicts a schematic diagram to illustrate the heat exchange between internal and external envelopes. In addition to the schematic diagram, the RC network of the developed model is described in Fig. 3 . 2.1.2 State-Space of the model In order to design a controller for the building energy management, the differential equations (4)-(7) should be transformed into a state-space model. Therefore, the state-space of the suggested thermal dynamics can be formulated as follows: (8) x ̇ s × 1 = [ A ] s × s x s × 1 + [ B ] s × m u m × 1 + [ E ] s × n d n × 1 (9) y j × 1 = [ C ] j × s x s × 1 where s, m, n, and j denote the numbers of states, measured inputs, disturbance inputs, and output variables, respectively. In the state-space (8)-(9), the states are [ x ] = [ T i , T e , T h , T a p ] T ; the measured input is [u] = PFloor; the disturbance inputs are [ d ] = T a m , [ T i 1 , ⋯ , T i R ] T , P S u n , P A p p l i a n c e T and the output variable is [ y ] = T i r . From the control viewpoint, [u] is the input variable subject to optimization. The data set [d] is uncontrollable variables that are imposed on the system as measured disturbances. The [d] data is extracted from sensors and metering devices. The ultimate aim is to obtain satisfactory realizations for output variables [y]. In residential buildings, a comfort band is determined for the output variable by residents. In this model, [A], [B], [E], and [C] are system, control influence, disturbance influence, and output influence matrixes, respectively. Regarding the thermal dynamics of the multi-room building (4)-(7), the system and influence matrixes can be stated as follows: (10) A = - 1 C i r × 1 R ih r + 1 R ie r + 1 R iap r 1 C i r × R ie r 1 C i r × R ih r 1 C i r × R iap r 1 C e r × R ie r - 1 C e r × 1 R ie r + 1 ∑ r \u2032 = 1 r \u2032 ≠ r R R e r r \u2032 + 1 ∑ a = 1 A R e ra 0 0 1 C h r × R ih r 0 - 1 C h r × R ih r 0 1 C ap r × R iap r 0 0 - 1 C ap r × R iap r (11) B = 0 0 1 C h r 0 , C = [ 1 0 0 0 ] (12) E = 0 1 × A 0 1 × R A w r C i r 0 1 C e r × R e ra 1 × A 1 C e r × R e r r ' 1 × R 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 C a p r The state-space model of the multi-room dynamic makes it possible to define different temperature zones in different rooms based on occupancy patterns. Therefore, residents can provide occupied and unoccupied temperature settings for the controller. Consequently, more flexibility potentials can be integrated into the supply-side. 2.1.3 Stochastic Gray-box of CTSM Designing a heat controller for the state-space (8)-(12), the constant parameters, including R and C, must be determined. To carry out the parameter estimation, computer software CTSM is used. This software is developed by the Technical University of Denmark (DTU Compute) to estimate the constant parameters of stochastic differential equations [36]. The estimation scheme of CTSM is based on the extended Kalman filter and features maximum likelihood on multiple independent data sets, including both measured inputs and disturbance inputs. In the state-space (8)-(12), the CTSM accepts the matrixes [u] and [d] as input data to estimate the constant coefficients of the state-space model, including R and C. The thermal model of the building, i.e. equations (4)-(7), is coupled with a data-driven model. The data-driven model includes sensor data which is used for parameter estimation. The discrete-time measurement equation is stated as follows: (13) Y k = T ik + e k where k is the point in time tk of a measurement; Yk is the indoor temperature from sensor (observed) data and ek is the measurement error. The measurement error is considered as Gaussian white noise. Considering the gray-box model, maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters are obtained. Estimating the thermal coefficients, the performance of the model is tested to confirm that the provided model is consistent with the sensor data of the heating system. Further information about the CTSM structure can be found in [37,38]. The CTSM is coded in the graphical user interface (GUI) of R software. 2.2 Thermal storage In a residential building, there are two forms of heat flexibility including thermal inertia of building and thermal storage. The former stems from the thermal inertia of buildings, i.e. (4)-(7) or equivalent state-space (8)-(12). The latter emanates from the heat storage in the thermal storage devices. In this study, both types of thermal flexibilities are addressed. In order to unlock the flexibility potentials of thermal storage, the thermal dynamics of a buffer tank is mathematically modeled. Moreover, to translate the heat demand of rooms into real controllable variables, the heat flow characteristics, including mass flow and forward/return water temperature, are determined. Considering the abovementioned facts, the mathematical model of the buffer is presented as follows: (14) C w × d T w dt = P H P - ∑ r = 1 R P Floor r + ( T cl - T w ) R w (15) P Floor r = m ̇ r × C p × ( T w - T Re r ) (16) P HP = η COP × P Elec Eq. (14) illustrates the thermal dynamic of the buffer. In Eq. (15), the heat consumption of floor pipes is described as a function of mass flow and forward/return temperatures. Note that the water temperature of the buffer is considered as the forward water temperature to each room. Finally, Eq. (16) shows the input energy to the buffer. The COP of the heat pump depends mainly on the temperature difference between indoor and outdoor environments. To give a general overview of the buffer and floor pipes, Fig. 4 depicts a schematic diagram of the energy flow in the building. 2.3 Economic model predictive control The MPC is an advanced control approach which represents a series of control strategies where the control input is determined based on optimization of an objective function and associated constraints. The MPC iterates over a predefined control horizon to find the best strategies. In DH studies, the objective function of the MPC is normally the temperature tracking of the indoor environment. In contrast, in the EMPC, the objective function includes economic cost functions. In the electricity markets with high penetration of renewable power, there is a strong correlation between renewable power availability and the electricity price. Therefore, price signals include important data about renewable power availability. The main aim of the suggested approach is to optimize the heat consumption of the building in response to the electricity market price. Regarding the close correlation between the price and power availability in the supply-side, the approach aims to provide demand flexibility to the electricity market. To achieve the aim, an EMPC is designed based on the economic cost function. The objective function of the EMPC is defined as follows: (17) Min ( T i r , P t Elec , ε k ) ∑ t = 1 N w 1 × ∑ r = 1 R T i r , Ref - T i r ( t ) 2 + w 2 × λ t DA × P t Elec + w 3 × ∑ k = 1 K ε k 2 s.t. (4)-(7) (18) (19) P Min Elec ⩽ P Elec ( t ) ⩽ P Max Elec (20) T Min r ± ε k ⩽ T i r ( t ) ⩽ T Max r ± ε k (21) T w Min ± ε k ⩽ T w ( t ) ⩽ T w Max ± ε k (22) P Elec ( t ) - P Elec ( t - 1 ) ⩽ γ HP up (23) P Elec ( t - 1 ) - P Elec ( t ) ⩽ γ HP down The objective function of the EMPC Eq. (17) is comprised of three terms. The first term describes the Euclidean distance between the room temperature and the preferred reference temperature. The second term illustrates the cost of electricity consumption by the heat pump compressor. The third term shows a slack variable to define a soft constraint for the temperature in contrast to conventional hard temperature constraints. The lower and upper thresholds of electricity consumption of the heat pump compressor is defined in Eq. (19). In Eq. (20), the comfort temperature band of residents is stated. The comfort band is set to the controller by the residents. The developed thermal dynamics, Eq. (4)-(7), address the multiple-room buildings. Therefore, different temperature zones can be set to the EMPC controller for different rooms based on the occupancy patterns. Eq. (21) describes the lower and upper thresholds of the water temperature of the buffer. The slack variable εk is defined to prevent hard constraints. Finally, Eq. (22) and (23) illustrate the ramp-up and ramp-down of the heat pump compressor. In order to optimize the objective function (17) with the associated constraints (18)-(23), the EMPC optimizes the control strategies in two levels. In Level 1, the EMPC determines the optimized heat demand for each room in response to the electricity price. In this way, the EMPC unlocks the flexibility of thermal inertia of rooms. In Level 2, the EMPC schedules the heat charging/discharging to/from the buffer in response to the electricity price. In this step, the EMPC uses the heat flexibility of thermal storage (buffer). Therefore, the flexibility potentials of the thermal inertia of building and thermal storage are unlocked in Levels 1 and 2 of the EMPC, respectively. In order to give a general overview, the whole procedure of the proposed approach is illustrated in Fig. 5 . 3 Numerical studies In this section, numerical studies are presented. First of all, the input data is described. Afterward, the simulation results are stated and discussed. The problem aims to optimize the heat consumption of the residential building in response to day-ahead electricity prices. To achieve the aim, a Danish single-family house with 4 rooms is simulated. The area of the test house is 150 m2 and the house materials are following the Danish building regulations. Fig. 6 describes the structure of the simulated house [39]. To identify the thermal dynamics of the house, the sensor data of the house is imported to the CTSM. Figs. 7, 8, and 9 illustrate the disturbances input data, including solar irradiation, outdoor temperature, and heat waste from household appliances, respectively. The 5-day worth of data, i.e. 120 h, is used to find the likelihood function. As Fig. 7 reveals, the solar irradiation for rooms 1 and 4 are higher than rooms 2 and 3 in the training horizon. Room 3 has the least solar irradiation due to the small window dimension and bathroom application. Fig. 9 describes the waste heat from household appliances. Based on the bar graph, room 1, i.e. the kitchen, experiences the highest heat waste from the appliances. The heat waste from ovens and refrigerators are the key factors. All in all, room 1 is highly affected by the uncontrolled disturbances, i.e. solar irradiation and waste heat, in comparison to the other rooms. In order to identify the thermal dynamics of the rooms, the input data of the house, including solar irradiation, outdoor temperature, the waste heat of household appliances, and the heat demand of floor pipes are imported to the CTSM. The CTSM determines the RC values of the thermal dynamics. The resultant coefficients are described in Table 1 . As Table 1 reveals, the thermal dynamics for each room are identified individually; therefore, the problem can optimize control strategies for each room based on the occupancy patterns. Based on the resultant thermal dynamics, Fig. 10 compares the predicted temperature with the actual measured temperature for 4 rooms. Based on Fig. 10, the precision of the estimation approach for room 1 is very different from rooms 2, 3, and 4. This issue emanates from the intensity of the disturbance inputs. According to Figs. 7 and 9, room 1 experiences high values of solar irradiation and waste heat from the household appliances. Regarding the solar irradiation, the magnitude of the solar power is higher than the other rooms due to the large dimension of windows. Besides, there are some heating power spikes in the waste heat of the ovens as a result of daily cooking. The high accuracy of the prediction temperature for other rooms, i.e. rooms 2, 3, and 4, confirms the justification. Therefore, the technical result is that the heating power spikes in the input data make significant disturbances in the prediction of indoor temperature. One of the great advantages of the proposed approach is that the developed model can address different temperature zones. Therefore, Fig. 11 introduces the daily temperature zones for the 4 rooms based on the occupancy patterns. The controller operates the heating systems during occupied hours and then turns them off/down when the rooms are unoccupied. While turning the heating system off/down may save cost or energy, it often increases demand on the heat pump when it is turned back on. In this way, the heat pump has to operate longer and harder to reach the desired indoor temperature set by the residents. To overcome this challenge, the suggested EMPC uses the storage capacity of the buffer to store heat energy when the electricity price is low. Then, the heat energy can be injected into the rooms during occupied hours when the electricity price is relatively high. The optimized heat consumption of the heating system for each room with the resultant indoor temperature is depicted in Fig. 12 . To justify the applicability of the suggested heating system, winter temperatures have been considered. The performance of the controller is evaluated over 7 days of simulation. As can be seen, the controller is successful in keeping the indoor temperature within the predefined temperature zones set by the residents. The temperature zones are set based on occupied and unoccupied hours. Therefore, the controller not only saves energy consumption but also decreases the electricity bills. On the other hand, the operation of floor pipes in each room is optimized based on the day-ahead electricity price. Consequently, the input peak power of the rooms occurs when the electricity price is relatively low. Note that the day-ahead electricity price belongs to the Danish sector of Nordic Electricity Market from 1 to 7 April 2020 [40]. The day-ahead prices are on an hourly basis. The optimized operation of the buffer is depicted in Fig. 13 . The figure illustrates the heating consumption of the buffer in response to the electricity price variations. Besides, the water temperature of the buffer is described. Based on the graph, the lower and upper thresholds of the water temperature are defined as 40 and 60C, respectively. As the graph reveals, the controller is successful in keeping the water temperature within the predefined band. Also, the energy consumptions of the buffer are mainly scheduled when the electricity price is low. Due to the predictive nature of the EMPC, the controller increases the buffer temperature in low price hours to supply the heat consumption of rooms when the electricity price is high. This issue occurs several times before the electricity price increase. In fact, the controller preheats the water to store energy for high price hours. Some preheating durations are pointed out in Fig. 13. Considering a strong correlation between the electricity price and renewable power availability in the Danish Electricity Market, the designed controller is successful to operate charging strategies of the buffer when the supply-side experiences an excess power generation. In contrast, as the graph reveals, the controller turns the electricity consumption off/down during high price hours when the electricity market faces a renewable power shortage. Fig. 14 describes the temperature of the return water from floor pipes of 4 rooms. In this figure, the return temperatures are compared with the forward temperature. When the control valves of rooms are closed, i.e. zero mass flow, no temperature is registered for the return water. This is the reason why the return temperature in some time slots has no value. In order to study the behavior of return temperatures with respect to the electricity price, the profile of the day-ahead price is depicted in the lower subfigure. The interesting result is that during high price hours, the average difference between the forward and return temperatures are lower than the low price hours. The results are depicted in Fig. 15 . Based on the figure, there is an inverse relationship between the difference value of return and forward temperatures with the electricity price. As can be seen, when the electricity price is high, the controller decreases the heat consumption of rooms. Therefore, the average difference between the forward and return temperature decreases. Fig. 16 describes the electricity consumption of the heat pump compressor over the 7-day simulation. The electricity consumption is plotted in two states including price-responsive and non-responsive states. The price-responsive refer to the EMPC approach. In the non-responsive state, it is assumed that the controller does not respond to the price variation; therefore, the controller aims to track the comfort band of the indoor temperatures. To clarify the role of the EMPC in providing power flexibility to the Danish Electricity Market, two durations are pointed out in the profile of the electricity price. First of all, when the electricity price is high, the electricity market may face a renewable power shortage. In response to renewable power availability, the EMPC decreases electricity consumption to provide up-regulation for the power systems. Moreover, during low price hours, an excess of power may occur in the supply-side. Therefore, the EMPC increase the electricity consumption of the heating system to provide down-regulation for the power system. In contrast to the responsive state, the non-responsive controller does not respond to the flexibility requirements of the electricity market. Table 2 illustrates the one-week electricity consumption of the heat pump compressor with associated electricity bills. Based on the table, implementing the price-responsive EMPC, the electricity consumption of the heat pump is a bit, i.e. around 1%, lower than the non-responsive state. But the electricity bill experiences a significant reduction of around 37%. Therefore, the results show that the designed EMPC not only provides demand-side flexibility to the electricity market but also decreases the electricity bills of the consumers. Generally, price-responsive controllers aim to heat the water tank in low price hours. Therefore, the heat energy is stored in the water tank for longer times in comparison with the non-responsive controllers. Although energy consumption cost decreases, the value of energy consumption is expected to increase due to the time gap between energy storage and consumption. The value of increased energy consumption depends on many factors including the capacity of water storage, the location of water storage, the occupancy pattern, etc. Increasing the water storage capacity, the flexibility potentials of the water tank increases. Besides, the total conductivity of the tank shell increases; therefore, much more energy loss is expected. The closet temperature of the water tank is also a key factor. For the water tanks located at room temperature, the heat loss affects the indoor temperature as a heat disturbance. In contrast, if the water tank is located outward, e.g. balcony, not only the energy loss increases but also the heat loss is wasted to the environment. In this study, a water tank with a capacity of 100 Liter and thermal conductance of 1.5 W/(K.m2) is used. The closet temperature of the water tank is considered as the indoor temperature. As Table 2 reveals, the responsive controller has consumed 1.27 kWh energy more than the non-responsive controller. The difference value can be interpreted as the cost of energy flexibility. Note that although the power consumption increases, the cost of energy consumption decreases due to operation in low price hours. In order to evaluate the energy loss of the water tank, Figs. 17 and 18 depict the energy loss for the tanks located inward and outward, respectively. In these figures, the indoor and outdoor temperatures are also described. Based on the figures, the total energy losses of the storage for the inward and outward tanks are 7.60 and 12.76 kWh, respectively. The main difference is that in the former, the 7.60 kWh energy is used to warm up the indoor temperature. Adversely, in the latter, the 12.76 kWh energy is wasted to the environment. 4 Current challenges and future studies Although the suggested approach was successful in integrating the flexibility potentials of heat pumps into the electricity market, there are some critical issues remained for future researches. The key challenges can be stated as follows: 1. The Danish Electricity Market consists of three trading floors a day, including day-ahead, intraday, and balancing markets. To trade flexibilities in the real structure of the electrify market, the approach should address the intraday and balancing market prices in the model. In this situation, the heat controller can provide power flexibility to the supply-side in response to the Renewable Energy Sources (RES). Approaching power delivery time, the uncertainty of RES decreases; therefore, the controller can provide power flexibility hierarchically from 24 h prior to energy delivery time until near-real-time. The three market floors make it possible to integrate flexibility potentials into electricity markets hierarchically on long, mid, and short advance notices. This is a novel idea for future researches. Fig. 19 shows a schematic diagram for the suggested approach. 2. In this study, the Domestic Hot Water (DHW) for sanitation, personal hygiene, etc. is not addressed in the model. This can be a great idea for future researches to add the DHW to the EMPC. 3. Due to the uncertainty and intermittency of renewable energies, e.g. wind and solar, renewable power is a stochastic variable. To adjust the day-ahead electricity consumption of the heat pump, the uncertainty of renewable power should be addressed. In this way, non-deterministic approaches, e.g. stochastic programming and robust optimization, can be discussed. 5 Conclusion This paper proposed a novel structure to adjust the heat consumption of a Danish multi-room house in response to electricity price variation. The thermal dynamics of the building were developed to address different temperature zones based on occupancy patterns. First of all, the thermal dynamics of the house were developed to address the heat exchange between adjacent rooms. To estimate the constant coefficients of the thermal dynamics, the CTSM program was used in R software. The estimation results showed that the estimation accuracy of the program is high-enough when the value of input disturbances, e.g. heat waste of household appliances, is relatively low. In contrast, when the input disturbances are intensive, the precision of the estimation decreases. To adjust the heat consumption of the rooms in response to wholesale electricity prices, an Economic Model Predictive Controller (EMPC) was designed. The results showed that the EMPC was successful in optimizing the energy consumption from the viewpoints of the electricity market and occupants. Regarding the electricity market, the EMPC minimized/maximized the heat consumption during high/low electricity price hours. Considering a strong correlation between the electricity price and renewable power availability in the Danish Electricity Market, the EMPC could provide down-/up-regulation to the market when a power excess/shortage occurs in the supply-side. Besides, from the occupants\u2019 viewpoint, the EMPC could decrease the electricity consumption cost up to 37% a week.

        "dc:description": "Increasing the penetration of renewable power in Denmark, demand-side flexibility is offered as a workable solution to hedge against the intermittency and volatility of renewable energy. In the residential sector, heat pumps are economic alternatives for district heating to unlock heat flexibility in response to renewable power availability. This paper proposes a novel economic approach to optimize the heat consumption of a single responsive building with multiple rooms. The suggested approach makes it possible to set different temperature zones for the rooms based on the occupancy patterns. To provide power system flexibility, an Economic Model Predictive Control (EMPC) is designed. The EMPC adjusts heat consumption in response to the electricity price. Integration of the heat flexibility into the power system, two types of heat flexibilities are investigated, including thermal inertia of rooms and thermal storage of buffer. To increase the applicability of the problem, real sensor data of a Danish residential building is used to estimate the constant parameters of the thermal dynamic. To achieve the aim, a model identification method is developed to estimate the constant factors based on the maximum likelihood function. Finally, the performance of the suggested approach is examined in response to the day-ahead electricity price of the Danish Electricity Market. The results showed that the suggested approach not only ensures power system flexibility but also decreases the energy consumption cost of the building up to 37% a week.",
