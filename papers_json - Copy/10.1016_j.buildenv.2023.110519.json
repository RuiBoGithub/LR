Natural ventilation delivers energy-efficient strategies for reducing energy consumption, improving indoor air quality, and maintaining a comfortable indoor thermal environment [2]. However, the successful implementation of natural ventilation needs to consider lots of critical features [3] and normally involves multiple targets. This generates challenges when adopting the conventional rule-based control strategy. Rule-based control (RBC) has been widely deployed in most building automation systems [4]. It follows the \u201cif condition then action\u201d control policy and requires deep domain knowledge and intensive human work to generate rules. Applying the conventional RBC for multi-objective building control problems is challenging, as it may not derive the optimal solution and thus leads to limited energy-saving potential [5]. Multi-objective optimization of energy consumption, thermal comfort and indoor environmental quality is well established at the building level with implementation of advanced control techniques [6\u20139]. Model predictive control (MPC) generates optimized control actions by estimating future responses of the system based on the dynamic model. Unlike other optimal control strategies, MPC employs the receding horizon approach to update the optimal control inputs in each sampling time interval and thus avoid the accumulation of control errors [10]. As an advanced control algorithm, MPC has demonstrated its great potential in addressing multi-objective control optimization problems and enhancing building performance in the past decades [11,12]. Many studies indicate that MPC is promising for the improvement of indoor thermal comfort while simultaneously reducing energy use by 15%\u201350% [13,14]. Spindler and Norford [2] deployed an inverse model to optimize the cooling strategies for a multi-zone mixed-mode building with natural ventilation. May-Ostendorp et al. [15] simulated a small office building with natural ventilation in EnergyPlus and used a particle swarm optimization algorithm to optimize window opening schedules. The simulation results indicated up to 40% cooling energy reduction with derived optimal night cooling strategies. The strength of MPC lies in its capability to predict future disturbances, consider constraints and building dynamics, and deal with multiple optimization objectives [16]. Despite all these benefits, the main challenge of MPC lies in identifying an accurate control-oriented system model and precise estimation of the system response, which heavily affects its control performance [14]. The process of model identification was reported to account for about 70% of the effort in developing an MPC controller [17]. Besides the requirement for expert knowledge, the physics-based nonlinear building model also demands high computational complexity for accurate system dynamics capturing, imposing difficulties in online optimization and control. Employing linear approximation of nonlinearity or simplified physics-based models in the system identification process leads to prediction errors and deviation from the actual building response [18]. Additionally, single-sided natural ventilation is a very complex process as it is affected by many factors simultaneously, so it is technically challenging to model single-sided natural ventilation by using linear models. Machine learning (ML) methods have received increasing attention in building system modeling [19]. Deep-learning (DL) models, such as the neural network models, have been demonstrated to be effective for modeling the nonlinearity of natural ventilation in terms of prediction accuracy and affordable computational cost [20]. Although feed-forward neural networks (FNN) showed promising results as system models in MPC, it is challenging to model complicated long-term dynamic processes given the unidirectional nature of FNN [21]. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) [22] was proposed to better capture the ordinal nature of time-series data with incorporation of feedback loops [23]. The effectiveness of using Long short-term memory (LSTM), a type of RNN, as a dynamic system model for chemical reactor control has been demonstrated by delivering accurate estimation and achieving the desired set-points [24]. Moreover, a comparison between shallow ML and DL models with regards to prediction performance was studied, and results indicate that the LSTM network significantly outperformed the shallow ML method for short-term predictions [25]. However, using a single data-driven model for recursive multi-step long-term prediction is sensitive to accumulated errors, as the predicted value at the current timestep is fed back in as the input for the next timestep forecast, and thus, leading to the accumulated prediction error. It is especially problematic when a small timestep is required to capture the short-term dynamics while a long-term prediction horizon is needed to fulfill predictive control goals. In this case, the model will be recursively called for many times. A single model may not be sufficient to capture the complex nature of both short-term system dynamics and long-term variation trends. Moreover, buildings are dynamic systems with uncertain and time-varying characteristics [26]. The dynamics of a building are significantly influenced by both external and internal factors, including weather conditions, occupancy, and internal heat gain, etc. These elements are highly time-dependent and nonlinear. Using a simplified time-independent model to estimate building variation over a long horizon could lead to considerable prediction error. Deploying an adaptive system dynamic model is a more desirable solution, as the model is refined continuously over time by using online operational data and thus maintaining better prediction accuracy, reducing uncertainty, and improving MPC control performance [18,27]. Yang et al. developed an adaptive MPC controller with NN model for real-time control of building thermal environment and found out that the MPC control performance increased over time with adaptive NN model [18]. Colmenar-Santos et al. proposed an adaptive MPC algorithm with ANN-based models to reduce electricity bill, improve grid elasticity and achieve thermal comfort in the household sector [28]. This study, therefore, proposes a novel Ensembled Multi-time scale Adaptive Model Predictive Control (EMA-MPC) system that incorporates adaptive multi-time scale deep-learning-based models and a bound control module. Specifically, deep-learning models were employed to capture the nonlinearity of the complex natural ventilation dynamics, and the ensembled structure utilized multiple deep-learning models (two Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models) with different timesteps to retain short-term dynamics while also preserving accuracy for long-prediction horizon forecast. Ensembled-LSTM models perform regular self-updating model parameters using online system operational data with a 24-h time interval. The proposed EMA-MPC system also involves a bound control module to ensure the environment stays within the threshold if an unforeseen scenario occurs while the model adaptation time interval has not been reached. A case study was conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The case study concentrates on optimizing window opening angle and duration in winter for a room with single-sided natural ventilation using automated windows to meet both indoor air quality and thermal comfort requirements. The control performance of the proposed EMA-MPC system is compared against the baseline RBC, basic MPC with pre-trained non-adaptive models, as well as the enhanced MPC with non-adaptive models and bound control. While addressing the challenges in smart control of natural ventilation, this study provides the following scientific contributions to the field: \u2022 Developed a novel EMA-MPC system to use ML models for controlling complex nonlinear building systems, which demonstrates superior performance while reducing modeling efforts. \u2022 Proposed a new modeling method for dynamic systems, i.e., Ensembled-LSTM model, that integrates multiple deep-learning models with different time scales to preserve accuracy for long-prediction horizon forecasts while capturing the short-term nonlinear dynamics. \u2022 Designed a hybrid online model adaptation and bound control mechanism to enhance the robustness and reliability of using ML models in smart building controls. 2 Methodology 2.1 Overview The proposed EMA-MPC system consists of three main features, including multi-time scale ensembled-LSTM models, a bound control module, and a model adaptation loop, which are designed to enhance the reliable use of ML-based models in MPC applications (Fig. 1 ). The first strategy developed in this study is using a multi-time scale ensembled-LSTM model structure in the system modeling process, which helps to maintain prediction accuracy with a long forecast horizon while capturing the short-term dynamics. A dataset was generated by performing simulations with RBC in a physics-based simulator. After preprocessing, this dataset was used to construct and train the initial ensembled-LSTM model of the controlled system, which is then used to formulate the preliminary MPC controller. The MPC optimization problem was designed to optimize indoor air quality, indoor air temperature, and energy efficiency. As the MPC system controls the environment, the MPC controller generates the optimal control strategies and passes solutions of the control horizon to the simulator. The measured disturbances, state variables, and control variables are collected in real-time and sent to the MPC controller at each control interval for next-round optimization. The details of MPC formulation are discussed in section 2.3. In order to avoid high indoor environment fluctuation due to unforeseen scenarios, a safety mechanism \u2013 bound control module \u2013 is added to the MPC control loop. With implementing the optimized control actions generated by the MPC controller, the bound control module checks the actual indoor air temperature of the environment on a minute basis. If the temperature is below 19 °C at the current state and the next window opening angle is not zero, it overwrites the next control action to close the window. The whole control process is demonstrated by the solid line in Fig. 1. Additionally, as shown in Fig. 1 dash line, the process of new database collection and model adaption with online system operational data is another crucial feature of the proposed EMA-MPC system. When the control system is in operation, the measured disturbances, the control actions generated by the MPC controller and refined by the bound control module, and the room conditions are appended to the new database. As suggested in the study [18], setting 24 h as the model adaptation time interval allows the operation data to accumulate to a considerable volume that may affect the building dynamics model. In this study, a 24-h time interval is adopted as the model accuracy check frequency for preparing the model adaptation. At the end of each full diurnal operation cycle, the model accuracy is checked by comparing the predicted indoor condition values and actual operation data. If the current model is inaccurate, the parameters of the system dynamic model will be updated by substituting the operation data stored in the new database. Otherwise, the current model continues to be utilized for the next day of control optimization. 2.2 Multi-time scale ensembled-deep-learning-based system identification The control-oriented model has been acknowledged as the cornerstone of MPC since the performance of MPC highly depends on its underlying model. Natural ventilation is a complex process that exhibits nonlinear dynamics, which can make it challenging to predict using traditional modeling techniques. ML models, such as support vector machines (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and artificial neural networks (ANN) are highly regarded for their ability to learn nonlinear relationships between input and output data without considering the underlying mechanism [29]. However, these methods do not effectively investigate the correlations between data [30]. To capture the time-varying dynamics of a building system, a dynamic neural network (NN) model for time series prediction is required [31]. The deep learning approach using RNN has commonly applied in forecasting time series due to their proficiency in processing complex nonlinear properties [30] and capability in tackling datasets with sequential correlations [32]. The LSTM naturally deals with sequences and can capture temporal dependencies by preserving the state. LSTM networks don't require predefined time windows, and they can accurately model complex multivariate sequences [33]. In order to comprehensively assess the most suitable model for the dynamic system, seven commonly used ML models were trained and compared, including Linear Regression (LR), Support Vector Regressor (SVR), KNN, Random Forest (RF), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Simple RNN, and LSTM. Their performances were analyzed to represent the controlled system. Mean absolute error (MAE) was used for model performance evaluation. Indoor air temperature and CO2 concentration are predicted with separate models due to different input parameters. Table 1 summarizes the input and output parameters for model training. The entire dataset was split into training, validation, and testing sets in a 70:20:10 ratio. To ensure that the data is divided into windows of consecutive samples and the validation/test results reflect realistic scenarios by being evaluated on data after the model has been trained, the data is not randomly shuffled before splitting. Table 2 describes the parameter settings for ML models. The sensitivity analysis was carried out to tune and determine the optimal combination of hyperparameters for each ML model. The hyperparameters of SVR, KNN, and RF were tuned by using grid search cross-validation with the Keras library in Python. Whereas, for the NN models, the number of hidden layers were determined by starting with a small number of hidden layers and gradually increasing the number until the validation performance stops improving, or until there is evidence of overfitting. Early stopping was also utilized for closely monitoring the validation loss throughout the training process to avoid potential overfitting. To capture the time-varying dynamics, the NN models were trained with look-back ten timesteps of historical data. ReLU was used as the activation function for all NN models. Adam with learning rate of 0.001 was adopted in training deep NN, as it automatically adapts the learning rate based on the gradient of the loss function [34]. Based on the model performance in the single-step predictions, the 15-timestep recursive prediction was also conducted to evaluate the model performance in making long-term predictions. It is found out that the LSTM model outperforms other ML models with the smallest MAE in both CO2 and indoor air temperature (Troom) predictions. Additionally, the LSTM model demonstrates its capability to capture the dynamics variation by delivering better accuracy in continuous predictions over 15 timesteps. The detailed model performance comparison is discussed in section 4.1. Natural ventilation in winter, especially in extremely cold days, may have an appreciable impact on the room air temperature within 1 or 2 min, which indicates the requirement of a short sample time for controls. Meanwhile, a long-prediction horizon is also suggested to take future weather and indoor environment conditions into account. With nonlinear dynamics of natural ventilation, requirement to retain short-term dynamics and meanwhile preserve accuracy for long-prediction horizon forecast, this paper proposes a multi-time scale ensembled-LSTM structure (two LSTM models in this study) for system modeling, where one LSTM model with a fast time-scale is used to capture the short-term system dynamics, while another model with a slow time-scale is adopted for securing the long-term system behavior trend. Within ensembled-LSTM, two LSTM models were developed to predict the indoor CO2 concentration for a 5-h prediction horizon. LSTM model 1, called f C O 2 _ f a s t forecasts CO2 every minute for 15 min long. LSTM model 2, called f C O 2 _ s l o w , predicts the average indoor CO2 concentration every 15 min over 4 h and 45 min of prediction time. f C O 2 _ f a s t is designed to capture the short-term dynamics of the indoor CO2 dynamics, and f C O 2 _ s l o w seizes the system's long-term variation pattern. f C O 2 _ f a s t and f C O 2 _ s l o w are integrated as one ensembled-LSTM model for CO2 prediction with a 5-h prediction horizon. The same method was applied for indoor air temperature prediction (Troom), where f T _ f a s t forecasts short-horizon Troom over 15 min, and f T _ s l o w predicts the average Troom every 15 min over 4 h and 45 min. Fig. 2 illustrates the proposed ensembled-LSTM model structure. The proposed LSTM models were constructed in Python with Keras package using TensorFlow backend. A stacked LSTM architecture was adopted, comprising two LSTM layers followed by a Dense layer. The input layer has a dimension of 11x10 for input data (11 input features with 10 historical timesteps values), and the dimension of the output layer is one that is either the predicted indoor air temperature or CO2 concentration at a future timestep. The model uses MAE as the loss function, ReLU as the activation function, and Adam as the optimizer. 2.3 MPC formulation The proposed MPC aims to improve indoor CO2 concentration, indoor air temperature regulation, and energy efficiency by optimizing two variables including window opening angle (x1) and duration (x2) over the 15 min of controlling time. To avoid the frequent change in opening angles, the control algorithm outputs a window control sequence for the windows to open with x1° for x2 minutes during the 15 min control horizon. If the x2 is smaller than 15, the window will be closed for the rest of the controlling time. The objective function is formulated to minimize the CO2 concentration penalty, indoor air temperature penalty, and energy consumption penalty, subject to the adaptive ensembled-LSTM model of the system and various constraints, as shown in Equation (1).

The temperature penalty (Tp) is the penalty added to the objective function if the predicted indoor air temperature is outside of the thermal comfort range from 20 °C to 26 °C. Similarly, the CO2 penalty (Cp) is another penalty term that prescribes a high cost if the predicted CO2 is larger than 800 ppm. The third term is the total opening angle (OA), which helps to minimize the total opening angle over the controlling time as long as the indoor air temperature and air quality requirements are met. This term is designed to reduce the energy consumption of natural ventilation in the heating season, as it affects the valve operational time to maintain the desired indoor air temperature. Different weighting factors associated with the three penalty terms (Tp, Cp, OA) are w 1 , w 2 , and w 3 , respectively. The window opening degree (x 1 ) has a constraint from 0° to 11.6°, and the duration (x 2 ) has the integer bounds from 0 to 15. Disturbances (d) is a 10 x 10 matrix, including all inputs described in Table 1 except the window opening angle. The Bayesian optimization with Gaussian Process is employed. Skopt.gp_minimize, a Python library, is used to solve this optimization problem. The simulations are performed on a laptop PC with Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8750H CPU @ 2.20\u20132.21 GHz and 16 GB memory. The proposed ensembled-LSTM models are applied to the EMA-MPC system for predicting the room responses to changes in control variables and determining the optimal window control sequence that can optimize indoor air quality, thermal comfort, and energy efficiency. The EMA-MPC system is designed with a 5-h prediction horizon and a 15-min control horizon. The EMA-MPC system controls the window operation while performing the model adaptation through the following steps: Step 1. Compute the optimal window control sequence by minimizing the objective function as stated in Equation (1). Step 2. Send the optimized control sequence over a 15-min control horizon computed by the MPC controller to the simulator. Step 3. While the simulator performs simulations with given optimized control action, apply the bound control to check the current indoor air temperature on a minute basis. If the current state indoor air temperature is lower than 19 °C and the next window opening angle is not zero, the bound control overwrites the next control action to close the window; otherwise, keep the original optimal control signal sent by the MPC controller. Step 4. The simulator will output the actual room responses (Troom, CO2) and update the disturbances within the 15 min of controlling time. All operational data within this 15-min control horizon will be appended to the updated database. Step 5. Time will advance to the next interval t + 15 min. Check the timer. If the 24-h time interval for model adaptation is reached, perform step 6. Otherwise, the procedure is repeated from step 1 with updated system status and new disturbances. Step 6. Perform the model accuracy check at the end of each day by comparing the model prediction and actual operation data. If the model is accurate, keep using the current model in the MPC controller. If the model is inaccurate, the updated database will be used to update the model and then send the updated model back to the MPC controller for the next round of control optimization. The procedure is repeated from step 1 with updated system predictive models. 2.4 Performance assessment metrics As pointed out by [35], American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Airconditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Standard 62.1 does not contain a limit value for indoor CO2. Instead, the ASHRAE recommends minimum ventilation rates for different types of buildings [35]. Thus, the CO2 limit values in this study were determined based on referencing other studies about impacts of indoor CO2 concentration on human well-being for office buildings. Tsai et al. found out that based on the generalized estimating equation models, office workers who were subjected to indoor CO2 levels exceeding 800 ppm experienced a greater incidence of upper respiratory symptoms or eye irritation [36]. Satish et al. concluded that a significant decrease in decision-making performance was observed in six out of nine scales when individuals were exposed to 1000 ppm CO2, compared to a CO2 level of 600 ppm [37]. It was also mentioned in [35] that indoor concentrations of CO2 greater than 1000 ppm have been associated with increases in self-reported sick building syndrome symptoms. Therefore, in this study, we define the low CO2 condition as the CO2 concentration under 800 ppm, high CO2 condition as the CO2 concentration that falls between 800 ppm and 1000 ppm, and unmet condition as the CO2 concentration above 1000 ppm. A recent review study on adaptive thermal comfort of office buildings indicates that the range of comfortable indoor air temperature in the naturally ventilated buildings falls between 17.6 °C and 31.2 °C, from winter to summer. Whereas in air-conditioned buildings, the range is narrower at 20.3\u201327.5 °C [38]. According to ASHRAE Standard 55, the recommended indoor air temperature range for winter months is between 68.5 °F and 75 °F (20.3\u201323.9 °C) for heating mode [39]. Barbhuiya and Barbhuiya [40] sets 19 °C as the lower limit for indoor air temperature in offices within an education building during winter. Chen et al. [41] takes into account the annual accumulation of discomfort degree hours, which represent the time when the indoor temperature falls below 19 °C (cold degree hours) or exceeds 26 °C (hot degree hours) in a naturally ventilated building. Hence, in the bound control module, 19 °C is set to be the threshold to trigger the window action to be closed. Meanwhile, 20 °C is the lower bound in the MPC algorithm design, below which the temperature penalty will be applied to the objective function. The total heating demands of the simulated space with radiant floor heating system is calculated as shown in equation (2). Where Q is the total heating demands, Tsup and Tret are the supply water temperature and the return water temperature. m ˙ represents the mass flow rate of water, and c p is the specific heat capacity of water. The heating demands are analyzed to compare the energy efficiency of different control algorithms. (2) Q = m ˙ × c p × T s u p − T r e t 3 Case study 3.1 Data description With applying the proposed EMA-MPC system, the case study concentrates on optimizing window opening angle and duration in winter for a room with single-sided natural ventilation using automated windows to meet both indoor air quality, thermal comfort, and energy efficiency requirements. The building called HouseZero, located in Massachusetts, United States, features 100% natural ventilation with automated windows and a radiant floor heating and cooling system powered by a geothermal heat pump [42]. A room with two south-facing windows and one skylight is selected as the testbed for this research (Fig. 3 ), and its other three surfaces are surrounded by adjacent spaces including offices and a lounge. A physics-based virtual testbed of the selected zone was developed in Modelica as shown in Fig. 4 . The \u201cRoom\u201d module models the building thermal dynamics of the studied case, which is largely based on the Modelica Buildings library [43]. The \u201cSEM\u201d module predicts natural ventilation rate based on window semi-empirical prediction model, which will be described in detail in this section. The \u201cControl\u201d module connects the control algorithm developed in Python with the building models in Modelica based on the \u201cPython36\u201d module in the Modelica Buildings library [43]. In the model, the metabolism level is assumed to be constant since it is an office building where people are mostly sitting. The model is calibrated and validated with the actual operational data from the studied building. The results show that the simulation results are generally in good agreement with the measured data. For example, the RMSEs of the simulated room air temperature for calibration and validation are 0.73 K and 0.76 K, respectively. Refer to [31] for detailed description of the model implementation and validation. The virtual testbed was used for dataset generation, different control strategies testing and the proposed EMA-MPC system performance verification. The prediction model for the natural ventilation flowrate used in the virtual testbed is based on a semi-empirical model for single-sided hopper windows described in [44]: (3) Q = min \u2061 ( C d , c o n v e r g i n g C d , r e c sin α 2 , 1 ) C d , r e c w | C p | ∫ z 0 h + h 0 z 2 / 7 − z 0 2 / 7 d z z r e f 1 / 7 U r e f where, C d , r e c and C d , c o n v e r g i n g are discharge coefficients for a rectangular office and a converging nozzle, which are set to be 0.62 and 0.92, respectively for this study [45]. α is the window opening angle. z and z 0 are the vertical positions of the window and the neutral plane. w is the window opening width. U is the reference wind speed at the weather station height. The subscript r e f denotes the reference value at the weather station height. C p is the pressure coefficient that can be determined by [46]: (4) C p ( θ w ) C p ( 0 ) = ln [ 1.248 − 0.703 sin θ w 2 − 1.175 sin 2 θ w + 0.131 sin 3 ( 2 θ w G ) + 0.769 cos θ w 2 + 0.07 G 2 sin 2 θ w 2 + 0.717 cos 2 θ w 2 ] where, G is the natural logarithm of the building length-width ratio. θ w is the wind incident angle. By implementing the baseline RBC as described in section 3.2.1, the virtual testbed was used to generate three months of data from November to January, parameters shown in Table 1 were collected with 1 min time interval. The dataset was split into training, validation, and testing sets in a 70:20:10 ratio based on the chronological order, and it was used for the short-term LSTM models ( f C O 2 _ f a s t and f T _ f a s t ) training and testing. Additionally, the same dataset was averaged every 15 min to produce another dataset for training and testing the long-term LSTM models ( f C O 2 _ s l o w and f T _ s l o w ), which was also split into training, validation, and testing sets in a 70:20:10 ratio. Short-term and long-term LSTM models were separately trained and tested, and then combined as an ensembled model for MPC with 5-h prediction horizon. 3.2 Case design 3.2.1 Baseline rule-based control system Rule-based control, which is currently deployed in the building, performed as the baseline model in this study. The RBC strategies were performed as stated in Table 3 . The RBC makes decisions on window operations based on outdoor and indoor conditions at each timestep. The window will be opened with degree of u angle if the indoor air temperature T room is higher than 22 °C and indoor CO2 concentration is larger than 800 ppm. The window opening angle follows a linear regression function which depends on the outdoor air temperature T out . The window will remain closed under other conditions. Refer to [47] for detailed descriptions of control logics of the mechanical systems in the building. 3.2.2 Basic MPC system To comprehensively evaluate and compare the control performance of the proposed EMA-MPC system, a basic MPC and an enhanced MPC that consist of the offline-trained non-adaptive system model are developed. Fig. 5 (a) illustrates the schematic diagram of the basic MPC system. The basic MPC involves a pre-trained ensembled-LSTM model and follows the objective function as defined by Equation (1) to determine the manipulated variables (i.e. window opening angle and duration) for optimizing indoor air quality, thermal comfort, and energy efficiency. The basic MPC is operated in a receding horizon control fashion as depicted in the Algorithm 1. The prediction horizon is set to be 5 h while a 15-min period is taken as the control horizon. Therefore, with the non-adaptive ensembled-LSTM model applied, the optimization problem is solved by taking the forecasts for the future 5 h and selecting 15 min decision variables that minimize the objective function. The optimized solution is passed to the simulator based on the control horizon time interval. Once the control horizon ends, the state variables (Troom and CO2) are updated. This process is repeated until the simulation period finishes (2 months in this case study). Image 1 3.2.3 Enhanced MPC system The basic MPC described above can be further developed by incorporating the uncertainties in the predictive model and optimization process when unforeseen scenarios occur. The pre-trained predictive model might be inaccurate for predicting the extrapolation points. To avoid the environment being unstable when encountering conditions that were not present in the training data, a bound control strategy is added to the basic MPC, which named the enhanced MPC system in this study. Algorithm 2 describes the control operation of the enhanced MPC system. By continuously monitoring the actual indoor air temperature of the controlled environment on a minute basis, the bound control module is able to detect if the temperature falls below the threshold, which is set to be 19 °C. If this occurs and the next control action generated by the MPC controller keeps the window open, the bound control rule will overwrite the next control action to close the window. The enhanced MPC system is designed to constrain the states of the environment to stay within the defined bounds and thus to help ensure that the control system remains stable even if the model predictions are not entirely accurate. Image 2 3.2.4 Proposed EMA-MPC system The basic MPC and enhanced MPC systems are designed with a non-adaptive offline-trained deep learning model that does not consider the robustness of the control system in handling uncertainties, time-varying dynamics, and unmodeled dynamics. Therefore, to further improve the control performance and system robustness, the EMA-MPC system is proposed, as illustrated in Fig. 1. The EMA-MPC system allows the predictive model to be updated as new data becomes available in online operation and to adapt the control strategy in real-time based on the current system state. Having a hybrid approach involving both online-learning and bound control, the EMA-MPC system can ensure improved control performance, handle uncertainties, and increase flexibility to adapt to changes in the system dynamics. Algorithm 3 describes the operation of the EMA-MPC system. Image 3 4 Results and discussion The main objective of this study is twofold. The first objective is to develop an accurate data-driven model of a dynamic system that can make reliable long-term predictions while capturing short-term dynamics. This section evaluates the performance of various ML models and compares the proposed ensembled-LSTM model against a single LSTM model with a long prediction horizon. The second objective is to compare the control performance of the proposed EMA-MPC system against three other control systems as described in section 3.2: the baseline RBC, basic MPC with pre-trained non-adaptive models, and enhanced MPC with non-adaptive models and bound control. The section provides a comprehensive analysis of the case study results and discusses the advantages, potential applications, and limitations of the proposed method. 4.1 Model performance The primary aim of the evaluation process is to identify a precise data-driven model capable of capturing short-term dynamics while preserving long-term prediction accuracy. The tested ML models are initially evaluated by comparing their MAEs for single-step prediction on both the training and testing datasets. This is followed by analyzing the 15-timestep recursive prediction on the test dataset for the selected models that have relatively better prediction accuracy. After identifying the best performing model, the performance of the proposed ensembled multi-timescale model structure is further studied with a 5-h prediction horizon and compared against a single DL model. MAE, as shown in equation (5), is used as the model performance metrics in this study. It is the average of the absolute error | P i − y i | , where P i is the model prediction and y i is the true value [48]. MAE naturally measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions without considering their directions, providing a simple and intuitive measurement. The study by Willmott and Matsuura suggested that average model performance evaluations and inter-comparisons should be based on MAE instead of root-mean-square error (RMSE) [48]. (5) M A E = 1 n ∑ i = 1 n | P i − y i | , i = 1,2 , \u2026 , n 4.1.1 Model selection As described above, seven ML models, including LR, SVR, KNN, RF, MLP, Simple RNN, and LSTM were trained and compared. As demonstrated in Table 4 , LSTM model outperforms other models, because it generates the lowest training and test MAEs for both CO2 and Troom predictions among all models for one timestep prediction. Upon examining the results of KNN and RF models, it has become evident that although the MAEs of these models are relatively small, there exist significant disparities between the training and testing MAEs as compared to other models. This implies that these models are overfitted and may not be effective in predicting unseen data. The KNN and RF models may have memorized the training data, rather than learning the underlying patterns. In addition to the one-step MAEs, the study also evaluates the multi-step recursive prediction performance of the models as depicted in Fig. 6 . Among these models, the LSTM model also shows the best performance to predict the future variation of indoor CO2 level and Troom with 15-timesteps recursive estimations. The LSTM model is well-suited for accurately modeling complex multivariate sequences and nonlinear dynamics. In contrast, other ML models may not be able to capture the changing dynamics accurately over continuous predictions. Therefore, LSTM model was selected in this study to model the controlled system and form the multi-time scale ensembled model structure based on its better performance and ability to handle time series data. 4.1.2 Ensembled-LSTM performance In this study, four LSTM models were developed: f T _ f a s t , 1-min T room prediction model; f T _ s l o w , 15-min average T room prediction model; f C O 2 _ f a s t , 1-min CO2 prediction model; f C O 2 _ s l o w , 15-min average indoor CO2 concentration prediction model. These models were trained with the dataset generated from the simulator based on RBC strategy. Models were trained with stacked LSTM architecture and followed by a Dense layer, as the deeper model is helpful in capturing complex dynamics. Fig. 7 illustrates the predicted results versus measured true values, which shows the LSTM models accurately estimate indoor CO2 concentration and air temperature with different timesteps for the test dataset. Table 5 summarizes the training and test MAEs of each LSTM model. As shown, the MAEs of f T _ f a s t and f T _ s l o w are less than 0.1 K for one timestep prediction, meanwhile the MAEs of f C O 2 _ f a s t and f C O 2 _ s l o w are around 1 ppm and 3 ppm respectively. LSTM models developed with stacked architectures are able to capture different time-scale system dynamics, and all models show good performance with very small MAEs and high prediction accuracy. By applying the proposed ensembled-LSTM structure, the models are combined as one integrated model to predict CO2 concentration over the 5-h prediction horizon. Similarly, the f T _ f a s t and f T _ s l o w models are ensembled together to estimate the indoor air temperature for 5 h in the future. The results of the study, as illustrated in Fig. 8 , show that the ensembled-LSTMs model outperforms the single model with 5-h prediction horizons for both CO2 and Troom predictions. By adopting the ensembled-LSTM model, the MAE of 5-h, look-ahead, continuous CO2 and Troom predictions are 8.9 ppm and 0.08 K respectively. Whereas, by using the single model, the MAE associated with CO2 and Troom predictions are 41.5 ppm and 0.72 K respectively. The proposed ensembled-LSTM models showed good prediction performance for long prediction horizon, which reduced MAE by 78.6% & 88.9% for CO2 and air temperature predictions respectively, with the 5-h prediction against using a single LSTM model. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the ensembled-LSTM structure outperforms the single deep-learning model for addressing MPC problems that require a long prediction horizon. The ensembled-LSTM structure is able to combine the predictions of multiple LSTM models with different timesteps to provide a more accurate and robust prediction under long-prediction horizon case, which can improve the performance of the MPC controller. 4.2 MPC performance The CPU time consumption per optimization for the MPC controllers by using Skopt.gp_minimize was 2 min 33 s for the PC used in this study as described in Section 2.3. For every round of optimization, the MPC controllers generate 15-min window operation actions for the control horizon. With support of more powerful hardware, the computational time is expected to be reduced. To test and compare the performance of the basic, enhanced, and EMA-MPC systems, the simulations were performed for 2 months from November 1st to December 31st during the heating season to obtain the responses of the test room, including indoor air temperature, CO2 concentration, and heating demands. The selected room was operating with a 9:00 a.m. to 18:00 p.m. occupancy schedule. The outdoor conditions were collected from our local weather station and adopted as the inputs for the simulation studies. The control performances of three MPC controllers included: 1) basic MPC, 2) enhanced MPC, and 3) EMA-MPC as well as 4) RBC as baseline, are evaluated and compared with the control of the automated window system of the test room on the virtual testbed. The objective function is designed with the initial indoor air quality biased weights, while it switches to the indoor air temperature biased if more than 20% of the predicted indoor air temperatures are below the preset threshold (19 °C) over the prediction horizon. The heating demands of the room are evaluated by monitoring the difference between supply and return water temperatures given the optimal control actions generated by the MPC controllers. Fig. 9 illustrates the distribution of indoor air temperature and CO2 concentration of the four controllers during the occupied hours over a two-month simulation period. Overall, all three MPC controllers achieve better performance in controlling indoor air quality as compared to the RBC. The EMA-MPC system performs the best at the task of maintaining a stable and comfortable indoor environment. Meanwhile, the EMA-MPC provides better prediction accuracy through online learning to update the model of the controlled system in real-time, as new data becomes available. As shown in Fig. 9 (a), even though the RBC controls indoor air temperature very well as it follows a strict rule, the CO2 concentration shows wider variation, more extremes, and higher frequency under high CO2, as well as the unmet CO2 conditions. Fig. 9(b) depicts the control performance of the basic MPC controller, which demonstrates strong capability to maintain the desired CO2 concentration for most of the occupied hours. However, it shows high fluctuation in the indoor air temperature and there are many extreme cases in which the indoor air temperature is even below 18 °C. This is mainly because the non-adaptive model used in the basic MPC is unable to adapt to changes in the system dynamics when unforeseen scenarios occur, and thus leads to inaccurate predictions and poor control performance. Since the CO2 and indoor air temperature prediction models were trained separately with different inputs, and the CO2 variation range was fully covered in the original dataset in this case study, indoor air temperature model is the one with higher uncertainties and vulnerabilities to the changes in the environment. To address this limitation, the enhanced MPC with the bound control was tested, and the simulation results are shown in Fig. 9(c). The overall performance in controlling the indoor air temperature is improved as compared to the basic MPC. There is much less time that falls under the threshold (19 °C) and the CO2 is also well-maintained within the comfortable range for most of the time. However, the enhanced MPC does not address the root cause of the problem, which is a fixed model used in the system. Therefore, the EMA-MPC system is proposed in this study, and Fig. 9(d) shows the control performance of the EMA-MPC system. The indoor air temperature and CO2 are well-controlled to stay within the desired range for the majority of the occupied hours. EMA-MPC is more effective in achieving a high level of control accuracy than the basic MPC and enhanced MPC due to its ability to adapt to changes in the system in real-time. Fig. 10 compares the results of four controllers in a working day's occupied hours. Fig. 10(a) shows that all three MPC controllers keep indoor CO2 concentration below the designed threshold (800 ppm), whereas the RBC cannot control the CO2 concentration well and most of the occupied hours are categorized as having a high CO2 environment. Even though the basic MPC is able to maintain the CO2 level at the lowest among all MPC controllers, it creates much more temperature fluctuations and results in extremely low temperatures as compared to the other controllers (Fig. 10(b)). Enhanced MPC can prevent extreme low temperatures, but it still generates temperature drops due to the fixed pre-trained model used, which could lead to inaccurate prediction in the optimization process. EMA-MPC system, however, as shown by the red line in Fig. 10(a) and (b), performs the best in balancing the temperature fluctuations while maintaining the CO2 level at the desired range. EMA-MPC helps to avoid the temperature sharp drop to very low values, leading to the improved stability of the controlled environment. Additionally, referring to the heating demands shown in Fig. 10(c), four controllers share almost the same variation trend, with only very minor differences among them. This indicates that the proposed EMA-MPC with multi-objective control optimization significantly improves the indoor environment without the compromise of energy consumption. Fig. 11 depicts the relationship between indoor air temperature, CO2 concentration, and outdoor air temperature, along with the optimized window opening schedule. As shown in Fig. 11(a), when the outdoor air temperature falls between −4 °C and −2 °C, the window is opened to a small degree of about 4° to better conserve the indoor heat, while a bound control mechanism is employed to prevent a sharp drop in indoor temperature on that day. In contrast, when the outdoor temperature is relatively higher, the window is opened to a larger degree and for a longer duration to maintain good indoor air quality, provided that the indoor temperature remains within the comfort range (Fig. 11(b)). This highlights the effectiveness of the proposed system in generating a window operation schedule that balances indoor air quality and indoor air temperature while considering the outdoor conditions. Fig. 12 shows statistical analysis of 2 months of simulation results comparing four controllers. Basic MPC, enhanced MPC, and EMA-MPC maintain the indoor CO2 concentration below 800 ppm for 96.6%, 92.7%, and 92.5% of the simulation period respectively, whereas the RBC is less effective in this regard, achieving only 69.1% (Fig. 12(a)). Fig. 12(b) demonstrates that using the basic MPC results in 3% of the simulated time under high CO2 conditions, while using the enhanced MPC and EMA-MPC results in 6.5% and 6.6% of the simulated time respectively. This is significantly less than using the RBC, which leads to 24.6% of the simulated time under high CO2. As shown in Fig. 12(c), by analyzing the unmet conditions when the CO2 is higher than 1000 ppm, three MPC controllers results in less than 1% of simulated time with unmet conditions. In contrast, the RBC gives rise to 6.3% of the simulation period with unmet CO2 conditions, which is approximately 7 times higher than enhanced MPC and EMA-MPC, as well as about 15 times higher compared to the basic MPC. In addition to the indoor CO2 level, the control performance of four controllers in terms of indoor air temperature are compared, as shown in Fig. 12(d) and (e). Based on the observation, EMA-MPC offers significant benefits in terms of maintaining a comfortable and more stable indoor thermal environment. Over the 2 months simulation period, only 5.1 occupied hours are lower than 19 °C when implementing the proposed EMA-MPC system, which is 44% and 93% lower as compared to enhanced MPC and basic MPC respectively. By using an adaptive system dynamics model, EMA-MPC can adjust its control for changes, which leads to improved performance against basic and enhanced MPC methods. Furthermore, as observed from Fig. 12(f), the heating loads with four controllers are very similar. EMA-MPC only consumes 4 kWh more as compared to the baseline RBC over the 2-month period. The results indicate that control optimization with the proposed EMA-MPC system can significantly improve the indoor air quality without compromising the occupants\u2019 thermal comfort and overall energy consumption. The prediction performance of the adaptive system dynamics model in EMA-MPC is evaluated by comparing with the basic MPC system. Fig. 13 (a) shows the trending of daily prediction MAE between the adaptive model and nonadaptive model. The MAE of the adaptive model shows an overall lower trend. When it detects high MAE, which means the model is inaccurate, the model will refine itself using new data, and thus lowers the MAE in the following days. New data collected can help the EMA-MPC system to identify changes in the system dynamics and adjust the model accordingly, leading to improved accuracy in the future predictions. Distribution of MAE of the simulated period is shown in Fig. 13(b). The median MAE of the adaptive and the initial models are 0.13 K and 0.37 K respectively. Therefore, adding the model adaptation feature helps improve the overall control performance of the MPC system with multi-objectives. 4.3 Discussion This study proposes a effective approach to address the reliability, feasibility, and robustness of using ML model-based MPC for real applications. MPC controllers that employ either a physics-based model or a ML-based model are effective in dealing with multi-objective optimization problems. However, the physics-based model requires detailed system information, a high level of expertise, and intensive human interactions for construction. The data-driven approach can largely reduce human efforts involved in the system identification process. However, uncertainties, including nonlinear and time-varying system dynamics, prediction accuracy with a long-prediction horizon, and unforeseen disturbances variations, impose challenges in the use of ML-based models in MPC implementation. The three-layer augmentation approach embedded in the developed EMA-MPC system is effective for addressing these challenges. Firstly, the use of multi-time scale ensembled-LSTM models in the EMA-MPC system enables the capability to capture short-term system dynamics while maintaining long-term prediction accuracy, which supports a more robust and reliable control strategy. Additionally, the bound control module in the proposed system provides a safety mechanism to ensure that the indoor environment stays within certain predetermined limits even in the presence of unexpected changes and if the next model adaptation time has not been reached. If the controlled system deviates from its expected behavior due to changes in the system dynamics, the bound control module will act to keep the indoor environment within the desired bounds until the next model adaptation time interval, at which point the predictive model can be updated to better reflect the new conditions. Thirdly, with the model adaptation feature, the predictive model embedded in the EMA-MPC system allows the control system to continuously adapt to the changing conditions, and thus deliver more accurate predictions and improved control performance. EMA-MPC outperforms other MPC controllers by delivering more reliable control strategy to ensure thermal comfort, better indoor air quality, and energy efficiency, while also providing superior prediction performance. The proposed method can be applied to other building system controls, including lighting, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, heat pumps, energy storage systems, shading devices, etc. For example, the demand response application normally requires a long prediction horizon, as the electricity demand may vary significantly over time. The proposed methodology can be adopted to deliver an accurate forecast for a long prediction horizon, and thus provide a better control solution in demand response applications. With a fully automated process, adopting the ML-based model integrated with bound control and model adaptation features enables us to improve overall performance of building systems and provide more reliable building automation. This study is based on a single-zone testbed. Multi-zone building control involves more complex dynamics, which may require larger size DL-based models and higher computational cost associated with online learning and real-time model adaptation. To tackle more complex and realistic building control problems, the application of the proposed EMA-MPC system for future work should be expanded and tested in a multi-zone testbed. Future research will also implement the developed EMA-MPC system in physical building experiments to evaluate its effectiveness and robustness in practical applications. Additionally, future research will extend to other building systems, such as lighting, HVAC, and shading devices, and to integrate multiple building systems for a more holistic approach. Moreover, future research is also expected to incorporate a more realistic occupancy schedule with different number of occupants, adaptive thermal comfort, and difference in thermal comfort preference for different occupants as well as enhance the interpretability of the deep learning model. As we advance in proposing advanced controls for natural ventilation, other ventilation solutions, such as single-room Heat Recovery Ventilators (HRVs), have also seen significant development in recent years. HRVs are becoming an increasingly viable option, particularly considering their improving affordability and simplicity of installation. The HRVs provide a high degree of energy efficiency with heat recovery, and offer enhanced IAQ by supplying filtered air, which is particularly advantageous for individuals with allergies. Despite these advantages, the HRVs still consume fan energy for operation, which can be eliminated in natural ventilation. Moreover, the single-room HRVs may have limited capacity of free cooling and night flushing against natural ventilation. Nonetheless, both options represent contemporary approaches to maintaining IAQ and thermal comfort, and a more detailed cost-benefit comparison is suggested in future research. 5 Conclusion This study proposed an ensembled multi-time scale deep-learning-based adaptive model predictive control (EMA-MPC) system to enhance the reliable use of machine learning models in real applications. A multi-time scale ensembled-LSTM model was proposed to improve the prediction accuracy and robustness for a long prediction horizon. Online model adaptation was implemented to constantly refine the model to maintain a reliable prediction accuracy over time, leading to better control performance in terms of maintaining the desired performance metrics. A bound control module was also included to help guarantee the safety of building system operations in the event of unforeseen scenarios. The module effectively keeps the indoor environment within the intended constraints until the next model adaptation time if the control system deviates from its expected behavior. The performance of the proposed EMA-MPC was evaluated on a virtual testbed with a natural ventilation case, and compared with the basic MPC, enhanced MPC, and the conventional RBC. It was found that the proposed multi-time scale ensembled-LSTM models showed a much better prediction performance for a long prediction horizon, which reduced MAE by 78.6% & 88.9% for CO2 and indoor air temperature predictions respectively with the 5-h prediction against a single LSTM model. The proposed EMA-MPC system achieved the best performance in balancing thermal comfort, indoor air quality, and energy efficiency among different MPC strategies. The system significantly improved indoor air quality without compromising the thermal comfort and overall energy consumption, which reduced unmet hours of CO2 concentration by 86% against RBC. The EMA-MPC provided more stable indoor environment control, which decreases the occupied hours with temperature lower than 19 °C by 44% and 93% as compared to enhanced MPC and the basic MPC respectively. To conclude, the proposed method reduces the modeling efforts required by conventional MPC through the application of ML. Moreover, the EMA-MPC system demonstrates an effective approach towards reliable use of ML models in smart building automation.

A multi-objective optimization problem is formulated to maintain indoor air temperature and CO2 concentration within the predefined comfort range while optimizing energy efficiency by controlling automated windows in a naturally ventilated room in winter. The EMA-MPC system demonstrates superior performance in balancing indoor air quality, temperature regulation, and energy efficiency. The ensembled-LSTM model significantly reduces the mean absolute error by 78.6% and 88.9% for CO2 and indoor air temperature predictions respectively, against a single LSTM model.
