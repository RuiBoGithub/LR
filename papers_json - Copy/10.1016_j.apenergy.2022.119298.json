In this paper, optimized controls to enhance the energy efficiency and demand response benefits of roof-integrated switchable insulation system combined with precooling strategies are evaluated for office buildings. A wide range of optimal cost functions are investigated to evaluate the total building energy saving as well as electrical peak demand shedding and shifting potentials. The results indicate that roof-integrated switchable insulation systems provide modest reductions even when optimally controlled of up to 5% and 4% savings in total building\u2019s energy use and electrical peak demand during a peak day. However, when precooling strategies are integrated with roof switchable insulation systems, optimal controls can enhance the performance of office buildings by reducing total energy use by up to 19% and electrical peak demand by up to 34%. Moreover, the analysis presented in this study demonstrated that roof-integrated SIS combined with precooling strategies offer significant potential to shape the energy demand profiles for grid-interactive efficient building (GEB) applications when optimized controls are deployed.

Recently, several passive and active technologies have been promoted to be effective in improving the energy efficiency in the commercial sector. One of the primary areas that have been given a special attention to reduce and shape building energy loads is adaptive envelope systems [2]. These systems can modulate their thermal and/or optical properties based on predefined and/or optimized control strategies to adjust heating and cooling thermal loads. One of the recent technologies that demonstrated its effectiveness in enhancing energy efficiency of buildings is switchable insulation system (SIS). Previous research indicates that SIS operated using 2-step temperature-based [3,4] and optimal controls [5,6] can provide heating and cooling energy savings when deployed in walls [7,8] and roofs [9,10] of residential [11,12] and commercial buildings [5,13]. For instance, Jin et al. [5] evaluated the performance of adaptive wall insulation systems applied to an office room when operated using temperature based and optimal controls. Their research indicates that adaptive insulation systems that uses optimal controls can achieve 50% reduction in heating and cooling energy end-uses relative to static conventional insulation. In a more recent study, Dehwah and Krarti [13] evaluated the performance of SIS allowed to switch its thermal resistance value between high and low settings according to temperature-based rulesets when deployed in roofs of commercial buildings. The analysis reported significant reductions of up to 62% and 24% in heating and cooling energy uses respectively. SIS by itself offers modest reductions in peak demand since it tends to maintain the building envelope at its high thermal resistance (R-value) setting during hot summer days to reduce conduction and solar heat gains [13]. Precooling is one of the common and easy to deploy techniques to reduce and/or shift the peak demand for residential [14,15] and commercial buildings [16,17]. Precooling relies on controlling indoor air temperature of a zone to store passively cooling energy using thermal mass in the building fabric. The stored cooling energy can then be discharged using surface activation mechanism to lower and/or shift peak demands typically occurring late afternoon hours [18]. Precooling strategies are more commonly applied in commercial rather than residential buildings since they are subjected to time of use (TOU) tariffs that offer incentives to lower the load profile and/or the peak demand during on-peak periods [19]. A time of use (TOU) tariff charges commercial users for high peak demands to lower the need for constructing new power plants and deploying less efficient generators [20]. Also, commercial buildings typically have moderate to high thermal mass levels which makes them suitable for effective precooling applications [21]. A large number of studies in the reported literature examined the performance of precooling using rule-based [22,23] and optimal controls [24,25]. Practitioners and researchers use optimization tools for a wide range of design and control applications including building envelopes [26] as well as lighting fixtures [27], HVAC systems [28] and thermal storage tanks [29]. The most common optimization methods used for precooling applications include genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) incorporated into a deterministic or a model predictive control (MPC) analysis environments [30]. In particular, GA has been effective in solving building energy related problems including precooling strategies as well as dynamic insulation systems [5,31]. Typically, optimization algorithms are developed to minimize a specific objective function including energy use, peak demand, or energy cost with and without demand charges and/or thermal discomfort [32]. For instance, Morgan and Krarti [22] carried out a series of parametric analyses to assess the performance of precooling strategies for an office building in various US climates. Their simulation-based study focused on investigating the impacts of key design and control variables including thermal mass level, utility rates, precooling as well as on-peak periods on the performance of precooling strategies. Through rule-based controls, their analysis found that 4 to 8 h of precooling, medium thermal mass levels, and short on-peak periods are most effective in reducing operational costs. The realized energy cost savings from precooling strategies are found between 10% and 20%. Xu [23] investigated the cooling load shedding and shifting potential of precooling office buildings through both experimental and simulation-based studies. The study reported 30% reductions in peak cooling loads for office buildings with high thermal mass levels. Henze et al. [33] evaluated the performance of precooling strategies applied to a three-story office building considering a series of sensitivity analyses. Their study investigated the impact of factors including building thermal mass, utility tariff structures, internal gins, on-peak periods as well as climate. Their analysis showed that under optimal controls using the Nelder\u2013Mead Simplex method, strong incentives from TOU tariffs enhances the precooling performance and hence results in larger peak load shedding and/or shifting potential. In addition, their study indicates that best cost savings are found for the office building with medium thermal mass levels. Moreover, cost savings increase from 20% to 30% as the diurnal temperature swing increase from 10 °C to 30 °C. No studies have been reported that investigate optimal controls when both switchable insulation systems (SIS) and precooling are deployed for commercial buildings. This is the first study that evaluates the performance of a combination of SIS and precooling strategies deployed through optimized controls to explore the potential for shaping the energy demand profiles for grid-interactive efficient building (GEB) applications. Most of the previous studies on SIS have almost exclusively focused on the energy efficiency aspects when applied to walls and attics of residential and commercial buildings. Few studies considered the integration of SIS and precooling applied for walls in residential buildings [4] and roofs of commercial buildings [13] using rule-based controls. In this study, optimal controls based on various cost functions accounting for both energy efficiency and demand response benefits are developed to operate both SIS and precooling strategies using GA optimization techniques. First, brief descriptions of the switchable insulation system, control schemes and the investigated building model are presented. Then, the results of a series of sensitivity analyses are discussed to assess parameters that affect the robustness and effectiveness of GA-based optimization. Moreover, the optimization analysis results specific to the performance of the integrated SIS with precooling strategies are summarized for an office building under a variety of climates and are compared to the results obtained using heuristic based controls. Finally, hybrid optimization-heuristic based controls are proposed and evaluated as alternatives to operate both SIS and precooling strategies. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Description of the switchable insulation system The switchable insulation system (SIS) considered in this study comprises of thermal insulation layers that rotate to a specific angle according to a desired level of thermal resistance [34]. The basic operation of switchable insulation systems when installed in roof assemblies is illustrated in Fig. 1 (a) and 1(b). The switchable insulation system can be installed in any building envelope cavity (e.g., walls, roofs and slabs) using prefabricated panels arranged as illustrated in Fig. 1(a). The system uses a rotating mechanism that controls the position of panels to make full contact or to create separation [34]. The system includes actuators that control the position of the panels by rotating them synchronously to a desired angle (θ) as illustrated in Fig. 1(b). Fig. 1(c) shows a relationship between the angle and the R-value based on an experimental study conducted on a prototype switchable insulation system [34]. In particular, the default setting of the roof-integrated insulation layer is at θ = 0° (i.e., fully closed configuration) with the roof construction R-value at its highest range of RH, representing the baseline building model with static thermal insulation. The rotating layers can be set at an angle to achieve a specific R-value for the roof assembly as shown in Fig. 1b including its lowest level (RL) for θ = 90° (i.e., fully open configuration). The low R-value setting (RL) is dictated by the assembly construction while the high R-value setting (RH) is climate dependent and is defined based on ASHRAE 90.1-2019 [35]. 2.2 Control strategies The approach of the analysis carried out in this study to evaluate the performance of roof SIS combined with precooling strategies is illustrated in Fig. 2 (a). In particular, a detailed energy modeling of the building systems including SIS and precooling is carried out using EnergyPlus, a state-of-art whole building energy simulation engine [36], while the optimization analysis is performed using various techniques using the MATLAB platform [37]. Throughout this study, the energy benefits of SIS are evaluated when operated using ruleset-based and optimal controls. The performance of roof-integrated SIS when operated using optimal controls are compared to two 2-step temperature-based controls. Both temperature-based rulesets operate so that the SIS layer switches to its low R-value setting when the indoor air temperature (IAT) is higher than exterior roof surface temperature (Tso) during the cooling mode or when Tso is higher than IAT during the heating mode as illustrated in Fig. 2(b). While ruleset 1 acts by switching from the default high R-value to low R-value settings when there are heating/cooling needs, ruleset 2 operates regardless of whether heating/cooling is needed as noted in Fig. 2(b). The switching activity, from high to low R-value settings, allows the building to reject heat within the building to the outdoor environment and hence lowers cooling loads during the summer season. Similarly, the building benefits from free heating by allowing the heat to transfer from outdoors to indoors during the winter season. The optimal settings for SIS are determined using genetic algorithm (GA) based optimization analysis for roof-integrated SIS combined with precooling strategies. Various objective functions are considered for the optimization analysis to achieve energy efficiency and demand response benefits including energy use reductions and peak demand shedding/shifting for the prototypical office building. To perform the optimization analysis, EnergyPlus is coupled with a platform that supports GA optimization, i.e., MATLAB [37]. Due to the substantial computational effort required, the optimization assessment is performed for a time horizon of one day (i.e., 24 h). Since GA uses a stochastic approach to generate random initial population sets, each optimization simulation is repeated for 5 times and the best solution is selected. For one-day optimization period, the control frequency for the SIS layer (i.e., the number of decision variables) is set to 24 when SIS is allowed to change its R-value setting on an hourly basis. Although the optimization analysis is performed for one day, GA simulations with high populations and high number of generations increase the required computational efforts. In an attempt to find the optimal solution, a default number of generations (i.e., 100 times the number of decision variables) [37] which is in this case 3,600 generations is used for the initial analysis. This ensures that optimization will terminate when reaching the function tolerance, a threshold for the relative change in the solution value, indicating that convergence is achieved. A series of sensitivity analyses is carried out to tune the GA-specific optimization parameters such that high accuracy levels are achieved while minimizing computational efforts as discussed in Section 3. Several cost functions are evaluated to determine their impact on the optimal operational settings selected by the solver. First, the optimal solution is evaluated when the objective function is set to minimize energy use and peak demand. Then, the objective function is defined based on the energy costs using flat rates as well as time of use (TOU) tariff structures. The TOU tariff structure has both energy charges and demand charges during on-peak and off-peak periods. For this analysis, the TOU rates are considered using energy charges of $0.10/kWh and $0.025/kWh for on-peak and off-peak hours, and demand charges of $10/kW and $2.5/kW during on-peak and off-peak periods. Typically, the demand charges are billed based on the peak demand occurring during each month. Since the analysis is performed on a 24-hour horizon, the demand charges are converted to an equivalent daily value assuming that all days of the month are identical. For instance, as shown by Eq. (2), the demand charge is divided by the number of days in a specific month. To ensure that indoor thermal comfort is maintained throughout the occupancy period, a penalty function is added to the cost function in order to avoid selection of solutions that violate the defined thermal comfort criterion [38]. For this study, the thermal comfort criterion is defined so that the indoor air temperature is between an acceptable range of 20 °C and 25 °C during the occupancy period. The lower and upper bounds in Eq. (1) represent the low and high thermal resistance values (i.e., RSI-values) of the roof construction and the range of precooling setpoint temperatures. Specifically, the lower bound for the thermal resistance is set at 0.3 m2.°C/W which is determined based on the construction details without any insulation layers of the roof assembly while the upper bound varies based on the climate zone and correspondent required R-value as described in Section 3.3. Moreover, the GA solver is allowed to select precooling setpoint temperatures ranging between a lower bound ( lb T ) of 13 °C and an upper bound ( ub T ) of 24 °C. Since thermal history has an impact on the thermal load calculations, the GA optimization for any given day is performed by initializing the simulation analysis for 22 days prior to the target day using a temperature-based ruleset for operating SIS when deployed in the roof assembly as well as precooling strategies. Table 1 summarizes the control scenarios and sensitivity analyses investigated in the present paper.

The building model is suitable for energy efficiency technology assessment, energy codes development and advanced controls analyzes [41]. The model has been developed and calibrated to be widely used for energy efficiency applications such as evaluating novel envelope technologies [42], HVAC systems [43] and controls [40]. A 3-D rendering of the building model is shown in Fig. 3 . The main characteristics of the baseline office energy model, made-up of steel framed walls and built-up roof structure, is summarized in Table 2 . Specifically, the baseline office building has a flat roof with a thermal resistance of RSI-5.5. The upper floor has an unconditioned plenum space where the SIS is installed. Specifically, the default setting of the roof-integrated insulation layer is at θ = 0° (i.e., fully closed position) throughout the year acting as a static insulation with an R-value that is in compliance with ASHRAE 90.1\u20132019 standard requirements and representing the baseline building energy model. The Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system operates using setpoint/setback temperatures of 21 °C/15.6 °C during the heating season and setpoint/setup temperatures of 24 °C/26.7 °C during the cooling season. Moreover, the insulation levels meet ASHRAE 90.1\u20132019 standard requirements when the baseline building is located in Denver, CO. The baseline internal loads and associated schedules for occupancy, lighting and equipment are illustrated in Table 2. For this study, Energyplus, a state-of-the-art whole building energy simulation engine, is used to predict the energy use of the office building and evaluate the performance of the SIS technology [36]. Energyplus features the capability of modeling advanced technologies such as variable conductivity materials and switchable insulation systems through the energy management system [44]. The roof system is modeled in EnergyPlus as a roof with an insulation layer that has a variable thermal resistance using optimized controls implemented through the Energy Management System or EMS utility [44]. Furthermore, the simulation is performed considering a 3-mins timestep. 3 Results and discussion This section presents the results of a series of sensitivity analyses to determine the optimal performance of roof-integrated SIS system. First, the impacts of several GA-specific parameters are evaluated on the accuracy levels and computational efforts of the optimization solutions. Then, the energy efficiency and demand response benefits of deploying roof-integrated SIS with precooling strategies operated using optimal controls for various cost functions using the prototypical office building are summarized. Finally, the performance of roof-integrated SIS assisted with precooling is evaluated when operated using GA-based optimal controls for the office building located in several US climates. 3.1 Impact of thermal history Since building thermal load calculations are affected by thermal history, the genetic algorithm optimization is performed by initializing the simulation using SIS and precooling controls [45]. Specifically, the simulation analysis needs to be adequately initialized prior to the target day when optimization is carried out. The impact of the number of days needed for the thermal initialization using precooling strategy is performed for the office building. Fig. 4 depicts the electricity demand profiles for selected initialization conditions during June 26 when the office is located in Denver, CO. In addition, Table 3 shows the difference in energy use and peak demand during the target day (June 26) for selected initialization conditions when compared to the base case. Specifically, the scenarios listed in Fig. 4 and Table 3 consider precooling the building to 13 °C from 1AM to 6AM during the target day. For the prior days, two options are considered for the precooling setpoint temperature (15 °C and 19 °C), precooling period (6 h and 9 h) and three options in terms of the number of days (1 day, 5 days and 20 days). The results indicate that when precooling is not considered in the initialization process, the energy use during the day is higher than that of the baseline case (i.e., 12% increase) since the building needs to be mechanically precooled during nighttime hours. The increase in the total daily energy consumption as a result of precooling is consistent with several studies in the literature [16,33]. This result is associated with the fact that a significant energy is needed to lower the building thermal mass without benefiting from any prior cool storage. Considering precooling the building to 19 °C for 6 h during a day prior to the target day results in 5% increase in energy use while reduces the electrical peak demand by 15% compared to the baseline. Precooling the building to a setpoint of 15 °C for 5 days prior to the target day reduces both total energy use and electrical peak demand of the day by 13% and 26% respectively as a result of the accumulated cooling energy stored in the thermal mass during the prior 5 days. The energy saving potential due to precooling strategies have been discussed in the literature [20]. For instance, Morgan and Krarti [22] demonstrated that precooling strategies can result in both an increase or decrease in the total daily energy use depending mainly on the climate and precooling period. Other studies pointed out the importance of the thermal history for optimal controls of precooling strategies [45,46]. Throughout the analyses carried out for this study, precooling initialization for 5 days (with setpoint of 15 °C and 9 h of precooling) prior to the target day is considered to be more representative of the performance for a typical day with prior thermal history of stored cooling energy. 3.2 Impact of optimization parameters Genetic algorithm (GA) requires several input parameters, some of which can significantly influence the search efforts and computational times including the number of decision variables and population size. It is important to note that every optimization problem is unique, and a sensitivity analysis is typically performed to tune the optimization parameters to suit the defined problem [47].. In this study, a preliminary analysis is carried out to determine the impacts of multi-step controls that considers several intermediate SIS settings between the high and low R-values. The results of this preliminary analysis indicate that GA optimization tends to select high or low thermal resistance values as part of the optimal solutions and rarely intermediate values. Although GA may select intermediate values for few hours during a given day, the energy use results are similar compared to when only high and low RSI-values are considered in the optimization search as shown in Fig. 5 . Performing the optimization analysis considering intermediate SIS settings (multi-step) requires higher computational times of 17 h for a single case compared to 12 h when only high and low RSI-values (2-step) are considered. Therefore, 2-step control strategies are set throughout the optimization analyses carried out for this study. The next subsections discuss the impact of various GA parameters on the accuracy levels and computational efforts needed to identify the optimal SIS settings for June 26th. All GA-specific sensitivity analyses are performed based on a TOU utility structure as the objective function (i.e., S-8 outlined in Table 1) and a constraint (penalty function) to maintain acceptable indoor thermal comfort levels as discussed in Section 2.2 unless otherwise specified. 3.2.1 Population size The population size can influence the GA solution accuracy as well as the required computational efforts depending on the optimization problem [39\u201341]. To determine the best population size for SIS and precooling controls, it is varied from 10 to 100 for a discrete search optimization. The computational times as well as the accuracy levels of the GA optimal solutions as functions of the population size are shown in Fig. 6 . The results of Fig. 6 indicate that the accuracy level of the optimal solution is only slightly affected when the population size is higher than 30. Optimal solutions achieved by the GA solver using a population size of 100 results in 18% reduction in the cost function relative to baseline. With a population size of 10, the accuracy of the optimization search drops by 40% compared to the case of 100. 3.2.2 Impact of number of decision variables (Nvars) For a given day, the optimization is performed to determine SIS thermal resistance values as well as precooling temperature settings for the desired time intervals. For instance, optimizing for every hour results in a number of variables (Nvars) of 36 with 24 and 12 corresponding to SIS and precooling set values, respectively. Nvars can be reduced so that the R-values are set constant during larger period spans. For instance, when the SIS is allowed to switch every three hours, Nvars can be reduced to 12 with 8 and 4 variables corresponding to SIS and precooling settings, respectively, as indicated in Table 4 . For the specific sensitivity analysis performed in this section, the solver is set to determine the best thermal resistance values for the roof SIS during June 26th while precooling starts 4 h the day before and ends during the first occupied hour considering the minimization of TOU-based energy cost (i.e., S-8 listed in Table 1) as the objective function. In particular, this section explores the impact of Nvars on the optimization accuracy level as well as the computational time needed to identify the optimal solution. Specifically, Nvars of 36, 24, 18, 12, 6 and 3 are considered corresponding to 1-hour through 12-hour time periods as listed in Table 3. The computational times and accuracy levels for the optimization as functions of Nvars are shown in Fig. 7 . Fig. 8 presents the results of the Nvars sensitivity analysis on the office building\u2019s electricity demand profiles during June 26th. As expected, the results indicate that high Nvars values offer more accurate results for the optimization solution since higher energy cost savings are achieved compared to those obtained using small Nvars values as depicted in both Figs. 7 and 8. However, Nvars of 36 and 24 show similar performance in terms of accuracy level and computational times. Nvars of 18 strikes a balance between acceptable accuracy levels (2%) and tolerable computational times (8 hrs) and hence is used for the remaining analyses carried out in this study. For Nvars of 3, the accuracy level as well as the computational time drop by 50% compared to the case when Nvars is set to 36. 3.2.3 Impact of penalty weighting factor As alluded to earlier, a penalty cost function is considered to restrict the optimization search to a certain indoor air temperature range that ensures that adequate indoor thermal comfort levels are maintained during occupied hours [Refer to Eq. (2)]. In the analysis presented in this section, the impact of the penalty weighting factor on the optimization results is evaluated when the on-peak period spans from 11:00 AM to 4:00 PM. Changing the weighting factor of the penalty function has no considerable impact on the computational time while slightly impacting the accuracy level as depicted in Fig. 9 . Fig. 10 (a) shows hourly profiles of electricity demand for three weighting factors [i.e., w = 0 (no penalty), w = 100 and w = 1000] associated with the penalty function of Eq. (2). Performing the optimization without the penalty function (i.e., w = 0) results in 15% reduction in peak demand during on-peak hours. Fig. 10 (b) shows that when there is no penalty function (i.e., w = 0), the indoor air temperature is allowed to drop below 20 °C defined as the minimum acceptable level for indoor thermal comfort. In this case, the GA optimizer precools the building during the first occupied hours to reduce the cost function resulting in a 2% additional savings in electrical peak demand compared to when a penalty function is considered. 3.3 Impact of objective function This section presents the analysis results when optimal controls are determined for roof-integrated SIS combined with precooling strategies using various objective functions. Based on the sensitivity analysis of the optimization parameters (i.e., Section 3.2.), the assessments discussed in this section are carried out considering a number of variables (Nvars) of 18, a population size of 40 and a penalty weighting factor (w) of 100. 3.3.1 Minimization of energy use or peak demand Initially, the benefits of SIS when added to the roof (without precooling) of an office building located in Denver, CO, is evaluated using two 2-step temperature-based rulesets (i.e., rulesets 1 and 2 depicted in Fig. 2) as well as optimal controls based on minimizing energy use. Fig. 11 (a) shows the electricity demand profiles of the baseline and SIS operated using 2-step temperature-based rulesets as well as optimal controls during June 26. It is evident from Fig. 11 that considering both optimal and 2-step controls using ruleset 2 to operate the roof SIS provide the best performance. Specifically, operating the roof SIS using ruleset 1 and ruleset 2 offers savings of 3.1% and 5.1% in the total building\u2019s energy use, respectively. Moreover, 2-step temperature-based controls can achieve peak demand reductions, during on-peak period, of 2.5% and 4.3% when ruleset 1 and ruleset 2 are deployed respectively. Optimal controls show slightly better performance when compared to 2-step temperature-based ruleset 2. Specifically, optimal controls offer 5.3% and 4.6% savings in energy use and peak demand, respectively. The roof SIS switching actions and the mean indoor air temperature (IAT) profiles are depicted in Fig. 11 (b) for June 26th. In particular, roof SIS switches to its low R-value for 2 h during the day when operated using ruleset 1 (S-1.1). The slight difference in energy use for ruleset 2 (S-1.2) and optimal controls (S-1.3) is a result of the roof SIS switching action as depicted in Fig. 11 (b). For all control schemes, the mean indoor air temperature (IAT) is maintained at 24 °C during occupied hours. The analysis results indicate that optimal controls can be substituted by the 2-step ruleset 2 to operate roof SIS since this simplified strategy captures most of the savings. Precooling strategies are utilized in this study as a load shifting strategy as they have been widely used to lower electrical peak demands for commercial buildings. Precooling the office building based on optimal controls with the objective function sets to minimize the peak demand lowers the building\u2019s energy use by 9.9% and the electric peak demand by 29.5% during on-peak period. Deploying precooling strategies along with roof SIS enhances the energy performance of the building as depicted in Table 4. In this section, optimal controls of roof SIS with precooling are evaluated with the objective function set to minimize total daily building energy use as well as electrical peak demand during June 26th. Specifically, the energy price and demand charge in Eq. (2) are set to take the values of 1 and 0, respectively, when the goal is to minimize energy use. Fig. 12 compares the building electricity demand for the baseline as well as optimal controls of roof SIS combined with precooling first based on energy use and then based on peak demand cost functions. In these optimal scenarios, the GA solver determines the best set of RSI-values for the roof SIS during June 26th as well as the best precooling setpoints for the period starting from 1:00 AM to 12:00 PM. As expected, optimal settings to minimize energy use result in the lowest total daily energy use. Specifically, optimal controls based on minimizing energy use results in 30.1% and 26.9% savings in energy use and electrical peak demand during on-peak period, respectively, compared to baseline. In particular, the optimization solver selects not to precool the building which is expected since the goal is to minimize the total energy use for the entire day. When minimizing the peak demand is set as the objective function, the GA optimizer precools the building down to 13 °C during 1:00 AM to 6:00 AM and then to 19 °C until the first occupied hour in order to maintain adequate thermal comfort level. As a result of these actions, savings of 18.7% and 34.0% in energy use and peak demand are achieved, respectively, relative to baseline. 3.3.2 Hybrid controls Since optimal controls are computationally expensive, simplified controls are explored to reduce the implementation complexity of roof SIS operation and assess their savings potential compared to optimal controls. Simplified controls, referred to in this paper as hybrid controls, consist of operating roof SIS using 2-step ruleset 2 and using optimized settings for precooling are evaluated. Thus, hybrid schemes (2-step + Opt Precool) involve a combination of 2-step temperature-based heuristic controls to operate roof SIS and optimal controls for precooling. When optimizing for precooling settings, the number of variables (Nvars) are set to 6 and hence the computational time is reduced from 12 h to 6 h compared to when optimizing both the settings for roof SIS and precooling. For the hybrid controls scenario (S-3), the hourly RSI-value settings of the roof SIS (taken from heuristics to operate SIS: Ruleset 2) and the hourly setpoint temperatures (taken from Precooling only Optimization: Precool Peak Demand) are superimposed. Table 5 shows that roof SIS operated using 2-step temperature-based ruleset 2 offers only slightly lower savings compared to optimal controls and hence is adopted in the hybrid control scheme. Combining ruleset 2 to operate roof SIS and optimal controls for precooling with minimizing peak demand as the cost function results in 17.2% savings in total building\u2019s energy use and 35.0% savings in electrical peak demand. This peak demand saving is slightly higher than optimal controls (S-2.1) but comes with a slight detrimental effect on the indoor thermal comfort. Specifically, the indoor air temperature of the top floor reaches only 18 °C during the first occupied hours which is beyond the defined acceptable range from 20 °C to 25 °C. To maintain acceptable indoor air temperature levels, the precooling setpoint schedule is adjusted resulting in 19.3% and 33.5% reductions in energy use and peak demand during July 26. Furthermore, the peak demand during the entire day is reduced by 25.4%, 31.4% and 31.0% when optimal controls based on energy use and peak demand as well as hybrid controls are used, respectively. Fig. 12 (b) shows the hourly variations of SIS and precooling settings for baseline, hybrid, and optimal controls. The results of Table 5 indicate that hybrid controls can capture most of the savings achieved by optimal controls using peak demand (S-2.1) as the objective function. 3.3.3 Minimization of energy and/or demand costs In this section, the optimization is performed considering various rates for the minimization of energy cost as the objective function including S-3, S-6, S-7, and S-8 as defined in Table 1. The optimization results, summarized in Fig. 13 and Table 6 , indicate that opimal controls of SIS and precooling based on a flat energy rate results in the lowest energy use (i.e., 30% savings relative to baseline) compared to other cost functions. In this case, the optimal control switches the roof SIS to low R-value setting during early morning hours when the temeperature outside is low and is suitable while keeping the setpoint temperature above 22 °C. Optimal controls specific to the TOU rate with no demand charges (S-7) results in 28% reductions in both energy use and peak demand during on-peak period. Scenario S-7 offers slightly lower savings in energy use (2%) and higher savings in peak demand (1%) over scneario S-6. Those differences occurred mainly due to adjusting the setpoint temperature to 20 °C compared to 24 °C in S-6. The decision of lowering the setpoint temperature to 20 °C from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM is taken to reduce the on-peak energy charges since the objective function is based on TOU tarrifs. Moreover, optimal solutions for the S-7 scheme shifts the peak demand from 5:00 PM to 9:00 AM which is an off-peak period for the rate structure used in the analysis as detailed in Table 1. Considering the demand charges during on-peak hours as part of the TOU rate (S-8) offer 6% additional cost savings (i.e., 34% relative to baseline) while the energy use savings are reduced by 9% (i.e., 19% relative to baseline). Indeed, when only energy rates are used, the objective function primarily minimizes the energy use, even though consequently peak demand is also reduced. When demand charges are introduced, the objective function accounts for both energy use and peak demand to minimize the overall energy cost depending on the weight of energy and demand charges. Considering hybrid controls (S-3), combining ruleset 2 to operate roof SIS and optimal controls for precooling using the minimization of TOU and DC as the cost function results in 17.2% reduction in total building\u2019s energy use and 35.0% reduction in electrical peak demand. This peak demand reduction is slightly higher than that achieved by optimal controls (19.7% in energy use and 34.3% in peak demand) but comes with a slight detrimental effect on indoor thermal comfort. Indeed, the indoor air temperature of the top floor is only 18 °C during the first occupied hours which is outside the defined acceptable range from 20 °C to 25 °C. To maintain acceptable indoor air temperature levels, the precooling setpoint schedule can be adjusted to result in 19.3% and 33.5% reductions in energy use and peak demand during July 26. 3.4 Analysis for the top floor The previous results pertinent to deploying roof SIS with precooling for the entire building indicate that precooling is dominant in reducing peak demand as well as energy use compared to roof SIS. However, it is important to mention that SIS is deployed in the roof and hence mostly the top floor of the three-story office building is thermally affected by its switching actions. On the other hand, all the three floors are directly impacted when employing the precooling strategy. To better quantify and fairly assess the contribution of roof SIS and precooling, their impact on energy use and peak demand of the top floor is discussed in this section. Table 7 shows the top floor\u2019s energy use and peak demand for baseline, 2-step, and optimal controls for several SIS and precooling scenarios. The top floor electrical energy use of the baseline is 517.9 kWh while electrical peak demands during the entire day and on-peak period are 40.7 kW and 39.0 kW, respectively. Deploying roof SIS using ruleset 2 (S-1.2) results in 13.8% and 11.7% reductions in energy use and electrical peak demand during on-peak hours, respectively. Deploying precooling strategies only (S-2) reduces the energy use and peak demand during on-peak hours by 5.6% and 21.2%, respectively. Indeed, mechanically precooling the building to low temperature settings (13 °C) before occupancy results in a decrease of energy use during daytime hours, however an increase of the energy use during the precooling period is expected. Integrating roof SIS with precooling combines both advantages resulting in reductions of 23.4% and 32.9% in energy use and peak demand during on-peak hours respectively. Using optimal controls to operate roof SIS and precooling with minimizing energy use as the objective function (S-4) lowers the energy use by 33.8% as expected but also reduces the electrical peak demand by 30.8% during on-peak hours. This is achieved by switching the roof SIS to its low R-value during early morning and late-night hours while keeping the setpoint temperature above 22 °C (i.e., no precooling). When minimizing electrical peak demand is set as the objective function (S-5), the results show higher electrical peak demand reduction rather than energy use as expected. Specifically, the peak demand during on-peak hours is reduced by 37.4% while the energy use is reduced by 24% when compared to the baseline. Those reductions are higher by 7% for electrical peak demand and lower by 9% for energy use when compared to S-4. The additional savings achieved by S-5 over S-4 in electrical peak demand is primarily attributed to precooling the building to 13 °C during early morning hours as depicted in Fig. 12 (b). The results of this section indicate that roof SIS has higher contribution in terms of energy use compared to precooling while precooling has higher contribution in terms of peak demand reductions when only the top floor is considered. Thus, roof SIS and precooling can enhance with the same magnitude the potential savings in both energy use and/or peak demand reduction depending on the cost function for low-rise (i.e., one-story) commercial buildings. 3.5 Impact of On-Peak periods Fig. 14 shows hourly electricity demand profiles, roof SIS thermal resistance settings, and precooling setpoints using optimal settings determined using TOU and DC rates to minimize the energy cost as the objective function. Three different on-peak periods are considered in the optimization analysis depicted in Fig. 14 and Table 8 with the first period spans from 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM (S-9), the second period ranges from 11:00 AM to 4:00 PM (S-8), and the third is set from 12:00 PM to 3:00 PM (S-10). For the three scenarios, the precooling period extends from 1:00 AM to 12:00 PM. Fig. 14 (a) shows similar electricity demand profiles for the three on-peak periods during June 26th except during hours 8:00 AM to 11:00 AM where the energy demand is lower for the first scenario (i.e., on-peak period from 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM). To achieve lower peak demand during the on-peak period, the GA optimizer decides to keep the setpoint temperature at higher settings from 7:00 AM to 10:00 AM compared to the other on-peak period options resulting in a slightly lower energy use during the day. For the three scenarios, optimal controls result in approximately 20% savings in energy use relative to the baseline operation case. It is clear from Fig. 14 (b) that in all three scenarios, the GA optimizer decides to precool the building to 13 °C from 1:00 AM to 6:00 AM and take advantage of the thermal mass in order to reduce the peak demand. 3.6 Impact of thermal mass Thermal mass can improve the precooling potential by storing larger amount of cooling energy within the building fabric to be later released and reduce electricity on-peak demands. The impact of thermal mass level on the optimal settings used to operate roof SIS and manage precooling is evaluated when the office building is located in Denver, CO. Three different mass levels are assessed including light (91 kg/m2), medium (158 kg/m2) and high (317 kg/m2) thermal mass. The thermal mass level is adjusted by changing the thickness of the partition floors as well as the type of indoor furnishings. Fig. 15 presents the results in terms of electricity demand profiles, roof SIS thermal resistance settings and precooling setpoints using optimal controls for the three thermal mass levels (i.e., S-11, S-12, and S-13). As expected, the optimization results indicate that higher thermal mass levels offer additional savings when compared to the baseline. Specifically, the potential savings from the deployment of roof SIS with precooling is 19% and 24% in energy use and electrical peak demand, respectively, when the office building has a low thermal mass level compared to the associated baseline (i.e., no roof SIS and no precooling but with a low thermal mass level). Medium thermal mass level increases the potential savings in energy use and electrical peak demand by 1% and 4%, respectively, when compared the case with a low thermal mass level. The use of a higher thermal mass level results in higher savings incurred by roof SIS and precooling with reductions of 20% and 34% in energy use and electrical peak demand compared to the associated baseline case (i.e., no roof SIS and no precooling but using the same thermal mass level). Specifically, for the high thermal mass level, the GA optimizer decides to switch the roof SIS to low R-value setting during some early morning and late-night hours while precooling the building to 13 °C from 1:00 AM to 6:00 AM to take advantage of the high thermal mass potential to store energy. The action of lowering the roof SIS to low R-value setting during the first two hours of the day can offer insignificantly higher savings (0.1%) but will compromise slightly on thermal comfort during occupancy periods and hence is not considered by the GA optimizer. 3.7 Seasonal effects The previous analyses evaluated the energy performance of roof SIS with precooling for an office building located in Denver, CO during a hot summer day of June 26. This section evaluates the performance of deploying the roof SIS with precooling when the office building is located in Denver, CO during a mild day (i.e., May 23). Fig. 16 shows electrical demand profiles and thermal resistance as well as setpoint temperature settings associated with baseline and various temperature based and optimal control scenarios during May 23. The results indicate that operating roof SIS (with no precooling) using temperature-based ruleset 1 and ruleset 2 results in respective reductions of 2.5% and 3.9% in energy use and 2.5% and 5.7% in electrical peak demand for the office building. The deployment of optimal controls with minimizing energy use as the objective function results in 4.0% and 6.0% reductions in total building energy use and electrical peak demand. Operating the roof-integrated SIS using ruleset 2 can achieve similar savings levels compared to those obtained by the optimized controls. The savings are achieved due to the actions taken by the roof SIS to switch to its low R-value setting during the early morning hours where outdoor temperatures are low to reject heat from indoors to outdoors as illustrated in Fig. 16(b). The roof SIS switching actions allowed the building to reject the trapped heat resulting in 95% reductions in the top floor\u2019s cooling energy end-use during May 23. When combining precooling strategies with roof SIS using optimal controls schemes of S-8 (i.e., using TOU and DC as the cost function), the total building energy use increases by 8% while the electrical peak demand reduces by 12%. Indeed, the GA optimizer precools the building to 14 °C from 5:00 AM to 7:00 AM and to 20 °C from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM. In addition, setting the objective function to minimize the peak demand (S-5) results in 26% increase in total building energy use but in 17% reduction in electrical peak demand. In this scenario, the building is precooled to 13 °C from 1:00 AM to 6:00 AM and to 18 °C from 7:00 AM to 9:00 AM. Precooling the building earlier during morning hours allows cooling energy to be stored within the thermal mass to be used later during afternoon hours and hence results in higher peak demand reductions. Considering hybrid controls by superimposing the R-value settings obtained from the 2-step ruleset 2 over optimal control settings for precooling only (S-3) has a similar performance than fully optimal controls (i.e., both roof SIS and precooling settings are optimized). Indeed, hybrid controls result in 22% increase in energy use and in 16% reduction in electrical peak demand during May 23. The peak demand during the entire day can be shifted to off-peak periods when operating the roof SIS combined with precooling strategies using hybrid controls as depicted in Fig. 16. 3.8 Impact of climate In this section, optimal and temperature-based controls of roof-integrated SIS with precooling is evaluated when the office building is located in four representative US climate zones (CZs). In particular, the analysis is carried out for the office building described in Section 2.3. when located in Tucson, AZ (CZ 2B), El Paso, TX (CZ 3B), Denver, CO (CZ 5B) and finally Rochester, MN (CZ 6A). The analysis is carried out for two days specific to each climate including the peak day in terms of summer electrical peak demand and a typical cooling day. Specifically, the summer electrical peak demand occurs on Mondays, July 24, July 3 and June 26 for Tucson, AZ, El Paso, TX, and Denver, CO respectively while it occurs on Friday August 4 for Rochester, MN. The typical cooling days of each climate are based on outdoor air temperatures including May 24, May 15, May 18 and May 26 for Tucson, AZ, El Paso, TX, and Denver, CO, and Rochester, MN as depicted in Fig. 17 . Fig. 17(a) shows that the four US climates have high outdoor air temperature profiles during peak days which are not representative of the weather throughout the summer season. However, those days are selected to assess the potential of roof SIS and precooling in reducing and shifting peak demands of the baseline electrical load profiles illustrated in Fig. 17(c). Fig. 17(b) and 17(d) show outdoor air temperature and electrical demand profiles associated with the baseline building case for typical cooling days specific to the investigated climates. The outdoor air temperature and electricity demand profiles are lower ranging from climate zone 2 (hot) to climate zone 6 (cold). The analysis results for both day types are discussed in the following sections. 3.9 Peak days Table 9 summarizes the energy performance of temperature-based and optimal controls of roof SIS with precooling in terms of energy use as well as peak demand magnitude and time occurrence during peak days when the office building is located in four US cities. During peak days, the highest energy use reduction achieved from operating roof SIS using temperature-based rulesets 2 occurs when the building is in Denver, CO (5%), followed by Tucson, AZ (3.7%), EL Paso, TX (3%), and finally Rochester, MN (3%). Moreover, Denver, CO, leads to the highest reduction (4%) in electrical peak demand during on peak hours while a 2% reduction is achieved in the three other climates. Generally, roof SIS offers modest energy savings and peak demand reductions during hot summer days due to the high outdoor air temperatures (OAT) combined with high solar radiation levels. The energy performance is not only attributed to the switching activity by the roof SIS but also to the temperature differentials between the inside (Tsi) and outside (Tso) roof surface temperatures. Denver, CO, shows the highest energy saving and peak demand reduction potential since it has the lowest Tso during the day primarily because of the relatively lower OAT during early morning hours compared to other climates as depicted in Fig. 17(a). Combining roof SIS with precooling strategies reduces energy use as well as electrical peak demand. Specifically, using optimal controls with TOU and DC as the cost function (S-8) results in 19% savings in total building\u2019s energy use for Denver, CO, and 12%, 6.5% and 5.5% for Tucson, AZ, EL Paso, TX and Rochester, MN, respectively. Furthermore, El Paso, TX, has the highest reduction (35%) in electrical peak demand during on-peak hours, slightly higher than Denver, CO (34%), while Tucson, AZ, and Rochester, MN, show 28% and 26% reductions, respectively. The peak demand during on-peak hours is shifted 3 h from 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM for El Paso, TX, and 2 h from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM for Rochester, MN, which is still within the on-peak hours. In terms of peak demand during the entire day, optimal controls offer reductions of 31% for Denver, CO, 25% for El Paso, TX, 23% for Tucson, AZ, and 16% for Rochester, MN. For all cities except Denver, CO, peak demand during the day is shifted to early morning hours. Specifically, the peak demand during the day shifted from 5:00 PM to 8:00 AM for both Tucson, AZ, and El Paso, TX, while it shifted from 5:00 PM to 9:00 AM for Rochester, MN. The difference in the performance between the climates is impacted by factors like thermal mass, load profile, temperature variation of OAT during day and night. Using the hybrid controls (S-3) that integrates 2-step controls to operate SIS and optimal controls for precooling settings results in similar savings compared to optimal controls of both SIS and precooling (S-8) for all the four US cities. The reduction in electrical peak demand achieved by S-3 is slightly higher than that obtained by S-8 since no thermal comfort criterion is considered for the hybrid controls in contrast to the optimal controls. 3.10 Typical cooling days Table 10 summarizes the energy use and peak demand performances of temperature-based and optimal controls of roof SIS with precooling during typical cooling days when the office building is located in four US cities. The highest energy use reduction resulted from operating roof SIS using 2-step temperature-based rulesets 2 occurs for Denver, CO (5.5%) followed by El Paso, TX (5.0%), Tucson, AZ (3.2%), and finally Rochester, MN (2.2%). Moreover, Denver, CO has the highest reduction (5.4%) in electrical peak demand during on peak hours while the reduction is 4.0%, 3.4%, 2.0% for El Paso, TX, Rochester, MN, and Tucson, AZ, respectively. Combining roof SIS with precooling strategies increases energy savings and peak demand shedding and shifting capabilities for the building. Specifically, using optimal controls that minimize TOU and DC (S-8) provides 21.2% savings in total building\u2019s energy use for Denver, CO, and 18.4%, 13.9% and 11.5% for El Paso, TX, Rochester, MN, and Tucson, AZ, respectively. Furthermore, El Paso, TX, has the highest reduction (31.9%) in electrical peak demand during on-peak hours, while Tucson, AZ, and Denver, CO, show 27.6% and 27.0% reductions, respectively. Rochester, MN, exhibits a modest reduction of 20.2% in electrical peak demand. Moreover, optimal controls offer reductions of electrical peak demand during the entire day of 28.1% for El Paso, TX, 22.1% for Tucson, AZ, 15.6% for Denver, CO, and 14.1% for Rochester, MN. The electricity peak demand during the day is shifted to off-peak hours for all four cities. In particular, the highest peak demand during the day shifted from 5:00 PM to 9:00 AM in all climates except for Tucson, AZ, where it is shifted from 5:00 PM to 3:00 AM. Hybrid controls increase the energy use while offering higher savings for Tucson, AZ and El Paso, TX but come with detrimental impacts on thermal comfort during the first occupied hours when compared to optimal controls (S-8). For instance, hybrid controls (S-3) results in 6.6% lower reductions in energy use and 2.6% additional savings in electrical peak demand during on-peak hours compared to S-8 when the building is located in Tucson, AZ. The indoor air temperature drops to 19.5 °C and 18.90 °C during the first occupied hour when hybrid controls are used for Tucson, AZ and El Paso, TX, respectively. 4 Summary and conclusions The energy performance of switchable insulation systems (SIS) combined with precooling strategies operated using simplified and optimal control schemes has been evaluated when applied roofs of US office buildings. In particular, the total building energy savings as well as electrical peak demand shedding and shifting potentials have been examined considering a wide range of operational control scenarios. The analysis is performed considering representative cooling days due to the high computational efforts required to determine optimal solutions. A series of sensitivity analyses has been carried out to tune the GA-specific optimization parameters to ensure high accuracy level is achieved while minimizing the computational effort. It is found that population size and number of variables can have a significant impact on the accuracy level and the computational time. Moreover, the analysis results indicate that deploying roof-integrated SIS alone operated using 2-step temperature-based controls can achieve modest reductions of up to 5% and 4% savings in total building\u2019s energy use and electrical peak demand, respectively, during a typical cooling day when the building is located in Denver, CO. Combining precooling strategies with roof SIS operated using optimal controls can boost the reductions of up to 19% in total building energy use and 34% in electrical peak electrical demand during on-peak periods for Denver, CO. In general, precooling the thermal mass available within the building shell results in an increase in energy use during off-peak hours but offer significant reductions in electrical peak demand for all US climates considered in the study. For instance, optimal controls of roof SIS with precooling strategies offer electrical peak demand reductions of 35%, 34%, 28% and 26% when the office building is located in El Paso, TX, Denver, CO, Tucson, AZ and Rochester, MN, respectively. The analysis results have also revealed that it is possible to simplify the optimal controls by combining 2-step ruleset to operate roof SIS and optimal settings obtained for precooling only to capture most of the benefits that could be achieved by a full optimization combining roof SIS and precooling. In particular, deploying roof SIS with precooling not optimization only reduces energy consumption but can also lower and shift peak demand. For instance, peak demand can be shifted from 5:00 PM to early morning hours when the office is located in Tucson, AZ, El Paso, TX as well as Rochester, MN. The study relied on a single-day analysis, encompassing peak and typical days, due to the significant computational efforts associated with optimization search to determine the energy efficiency potential of the SIS technology. Indeed, the performance of the technology may vary daily depending on the climate as well as the load profile. While optimal solutions of individual days can be used as benchmarks to evaluate the performance of simplified rule-based controls as demonstrated in this study, future work can consider optimal control strategies for operating the SIS technology on an annual basis. The study demonstrated that roof-integrated SIS combined with precooling strategies offer significant potential for grid-interactive efficient building (GEB) applications. Additional savings can be realized when deploying the technology for large scale applications such communities and urban centers. While this study quantified energy efficiency and peak demand benefits of SIS, future research work is needed to evaluate the cost-benefits of the technology when applied to new and existing buildings. Moreover, optimization techniques combined with model predictive controls and forecasting approaches could be considered to optimize the performance of the adaptive envelope systems to account for uncertainties of future loads. In addition, there is a need to assess the performance of the switchable insulation technology when combined with phase change materials (PCMs) and applied to both walls and roofs of commercial as well as residential buildings.

        "dc:description": "In this paper, optimized controls to enhance the energy efficiency and demand response benefits of roof-integrated switchable insulation system combined with precooling strategies are evaluated for office buildings. A wide range of optimal cost functions are investigated to evaluate the total building energy saving as well as electrical peak demand shedding and shifting potentials. The results indicate that roof-integrated switchable insulation systems provide modest reductions even when optimally controlled of up to 5% and 4% savings in total building\u2019s energy use and electrical peak demand during a peak day. However, when precooling strategies are integrated with roof switchable insulation systems, optimal controls can enhance the performance of office buildings by reducing total energy use by up to 19% and electrical peak demand by up to 34%. Moreover, the analysis presented in this study demonstrated that roof-integrated SIS combined with precooling strategies offer significant potential to shape the energy demand profiles for grid-interactive efficient building (GEB) applications when optimized controls are deployed.",
