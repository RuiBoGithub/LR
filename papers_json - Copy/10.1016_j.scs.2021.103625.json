Model-free control approaches, such as Reinforcement Learning (RL), can be trained using historical data and therefore have the advantage of low cost and scalability. However, RL does not provide efficient, coordinated control for regional buildings, which leads to inter-building energy coupling, and thus resulting in higher energy consumption. This paper presents energy optimization strategies based on Distributed Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to reduce energy consumption in regional buildings while maintaining human comfort. The proposed strategy's system learns to regulate procedures to reduce building energy consumption through parameter sharing and coordination optimization. The energy optimization strategies are validated in this research by utilizing nine campus buildings as a case analysis. The results show that the system achieves the lowest total energy consumption with the employed strategies against the Rule-Based Control (RBC), Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) strategy, Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm Ⅱ (NSGA-Ⅱ). Furthermore, the proposed energy optimization strategies demonstrated good accuracy and robustness with a comprehensive evaluation of multi-building energy consumption in error analysis, load factor, power demand, and net power consumption. Keywords Distributed reinforcement learning Soft Actor-Critic strategy Building energy optimization Comprehensive evaluation 1 Introduction Energy of energy and climate change are linked to human growth, which is a significant concern for all countries throughout the globe. The paper focuses on sustainable city growth. Because the buildings in which people reside are at the heart of cities, decreasing the energy consumption of regional structures may help cities develop more sustainably (Ciancio et al., 2020). According to the share of various energy sectors in the world, the total energy used in buildings accounts for approximately 40% of the annual energy use worldwide (Brozovsky, Gustavsen & Gaitani, 2021). As a large proportion of building energy is used for Heating, Cooling, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) (Andreou, Barrett, Taylor, Brockway & Wadud, 2020), controllable energy provides the potential for building energy optimization. As a result, the construction industry has prioritized reducing building energy use. Advanced controls can cut energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions by 13% to 28% (Abd Alla, Bianco, Tagliafico & Scarpa, 2020; Hashempour, Taherkhani & Mahdikhani, 2020; Rode et al., 2021). It indicates that, in theory, yearly energy savings of 7.488PMh to 16.128PMh may be obtained. As a result, addressing the issue of building energy usage increases energy efficiency and economic value, creating circumstances for sustainable growth. However, most buildings use Rule-Based Control (RBC) (Jayathissa et al., 2017; Péan, Salom & Costa-Castelló, 2019) to achieve limited energy savings. The RBCs are the rules to be followed to control the system or instrument. These rules are sometimes referred to as \u2018If statements\u2019 as they tend to follow the line of \u2018IF X happens THEN do Y\u2019. Essential RBC solutions have gained popularity in buildings that are not or inadequately adjusted to the underlying system (Artiges, Nassiopoulos, Vial & Delinchant, 2020). As a result, the full potential of these buildings is not explored. Model predictive control (MPC) has been shown to be a viable technique for reducing building energy consumption while enhancing occupant comfort in simulation studies and pilot instances (Rastegarpour, Gros & Ferrarini, 2020). MPC is a control technique that optimizes control actions over a fixed time horizon based on provided objective criteria, projected dynamic behavior of the system, system limitations, and future disturbance forecasting. However, there is currently a paucity of MPC implementation in real-world, large-scale, fully occupied buildings, which would help to demonstrate the potential of MPC in real-world building operations (Freund & Schmitz, 2021). In order to overcome these disadvantages, Data-Driven Predictive Control (DPC) was instead of MPC. Smarra et al. (2018) uses random forest predictive control to reduce peak energy consumption in buildings. However, the results show that these models are subjected to over-fitting and high variance. Drgoňa, Picard, Kvasnica and Helsen (2018), an approximate MPC was developed based on two multiple regression algorithms, the Time Delay Neural Network (TDNN) and the Regression Tree (RT), which have been validated for the residential buildings. The advantage of the above approach is that it simplifies the control law and maintains a performance comparable to that of MPC. However, the RT-based controller scores worse in performance than a well-tuned Proportion Integral Differential (PID) controller due to the lack of modeling accuracy. To alleviate the shortcomings above, in Wei et al. (2019), an approach to occupancy level and energy consumption based on Blind System Identification: Feedforward Neural Network and Extreme Learning Machine are used to establish the prediction model of electricity consumption of air conditioning systems. The result shows that the occupancy number, as the input, can improve the accuracy in predicting energy consumption using a neural-network model. Zhu, Tian, Yin, Li and Shi (2020) proposed a new Bayesian approach by combining approximate Bayesian computation with machine learning techniques to calibrate building models without calculating the likelihood function. The results show that this new Bayesian computation method combined with machine learning can provide accurate and reliable models for building energy models. In Lu, Tian, Zhou and Liu (2021), a Time-Attentive Encoder-Decoder Network (TA-EDN) model, which mainly employs a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Encoder-Decoder Network (EDN) for multi-step-ahead thermal load prediction. The results show that the TA-EDN model significantly improves the prediction accuracy of the future heat load time series. Tian, Zhu, Sun, Li and Yin (2021) investigated the energy model and compared ten machine learning algorithms in terms of learning model tuning, variable relevance, and model discrepancy spatial analysis. The findings suggest that combining these three factors can provide insight into energy patterns in urban structures. Another effective method for predicting building energy use is Genetic Algorithms (GA) (Wei et al., 2018). Ghaderian and Veysi (2021) proposes an optimization technique based on integrating surrogate models with a multi-objective Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm Ⅱ (NSGA-Ⅱ) to simultaneously improve the building's energy consumption and occupants' thermal comfort, thereby decreasing computing expenses. Nazari et al. have developed an energy demand estimation model based on GA and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for residential and commercial applications. According to their findings, the best prediction scenario, was generated from an exponential model simulated using a PSO algorithm (Nazari, Kazemi, Hashemi, Sadat & Nazari, 2015). Li and Su used a genetic algorithm-hierarchical adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system to estimate daily air-conditioning usage (Li & Su, 2010). A clustering technique was used to discover natural groupings of data from a vast data collection in this study. The unknown cluster parameters were then optimized by reducing GA's prediction errors. Traditional algorithms, such as MPC, RBC, and GA, can be implemented for single buildings, but the accuracy and complexity of building models limit their development when considering regional buildings or entire cities. Furthermore, the building system is dynamic and susceptible to various environmental disturbances. In addition, due to challenging building data collection and long sample intervals, there is an issue with incomplete datasets. Except for data enhancement (Lu, Tian, Zhang, Zhou & Chu, 2021), adaptive model-free controllers, such as reinforcement learning (RL), offer the ability to solve these issues. The problem of missing data is addressed by the experience playback mechanism because reinforcement learning may learn itself depending on the settings of the reward functions. As a result, RL engages with the managed system and uses data to determine the best control approach (Han, Zhao, Zhang, Shen & Li, 2021; Vázquez-Canteli, Ulyanin, Kämpf & Nagy, 2019). Professor Yang's team has used two different Q-learning approaches, namely Tabular and Artificial Neural Network, to simulate the control of elements such as photovoltaic heat panels and heat pumps in buildings (Yang, Nagy, Goffin & Schlueter, 2015). However, research in this area is weaker for urban-scale energy management and demand response. In 2019 Kazmi's team discussed multiple agents' learning strategies and information sharing between agents and optimized regional building energy consumption (Kazmi, Suykens, Balint & Driesen, 2019). The Jose R. Vazquez-Canteli team introduced MARLISA, a multi-subject RL controller and a proposed iterative sequential action selection algorithm (Han et al., 2019). However, this method has not solved the coordination between energy consumption and human comfort between buildings, allowing energy coupling and thus leading to higher energy consumption. Therefore, to solve the problem of increasing energy consumption in regional buildings, the main objective of this paper is to improve energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions by proposing a control strategy for Distributed Reinforcement Learning (DRL) while achieving human comfort targets. At the same time, it provides solutions for cities\u2019 sustainable development and global energy-saving and emission reduction. In Section 2, an energy optimization scheme for regional building energy consumption based on DRL is presented. Then, Section 3 contains a set of distributed algorithms widely used for multi-building energy optimization. After that, Section 4 performs joint simulation and analysis of nine buildings\u2019 energy consumption and discusses the algorithm's feasibility through several evaluation metrics. Finally, Section 5 presents the algorithm's advantages and limitations. 2 Architecture for optimal control of distributed energy consumption in regional buildings This section introduces the framework CityLearn (Vázquez-Canteli, Kämpf, Henze & Nagy, 2019) first, based on the OpenAI Gym, and allows researchers to more easily implement, share, replicate and compare reinforcement learning implementations of demand response applications. Then, based on the framework mentioned above, the control optimization scheme described in this paper contains an improved MARLISA algorithm, initially proposed by Vazquez-Canteli, Henze and Nagy (2020). The developed algorithm has two primary improvements compared to reinforcement learning algorithms, as follows: (1) An improved Least Square Boosting (LSBoost) algorithm for energy prediction of building masses. (2) The algorithm's reward and penalty functions use an incentive mechanism for staggered electricity consumption. The control method integrates multi-agent DRL with an iterative sequential action selection algorithm for a controller to model electrical energy demands in a district building energy system. This method employs a reward function with a single or multi-building objective, forecasts the building's future power consumption using an iterative reinforcement learning algorithm, and uses a leader-follower model to transfer electrical energy information to each other. The multi-building energy optimization issue must be formulated with aggregated supervision as a DRL predictive control problem. The goal is to look at how buildings interact with one another regarding energy usage. Thus, an iterative learning technique is utilized to enable the coordination and harmonization of energy consumption in various buildings using a DRL approach, such that regional energy peaks are nudged and alleviated. Furthermore, numerous buildings collaborate to achieve human comfort goals. Fig. 1 depicts the architecture of the multi-agent reinforcement learning distributed algorithm. Each of the region's buildings has its own reinforcement learning agents. Our objective is to create these agents that can learn to coordinate their energy consumption using stochastic rules and without prior knowledge of the system dynamics. Furthermore, the agents should learn to shape the microgrid's electrical load from an energy standpoint. Specifically, by establishing optimization objectives so that the agents may maintain the building's regular operation while consuming less energy. 3 Multi-agent distributed reinforcement learning algorithms According to the second chapter's explanation of the system architecture, the system is separated into two components: building energy consumption prediction and building energy consumption optimization and control. Firstly, examine the prediction method to forecast the building's energy usage. Precise energy consumption estimates serve as the foundation for distributed algorithms that weigh each building's energy use. The LSBoost algorithm is improved to generate a higher-precision building energy consumption model, which enhances prediction accuracy. Secondly, this article is based on the distributed RL algorithm, which criticizes and corrects methods so that each building's energy consumption system may learn to manage regional building energy consumption optimally. For building energy savings, the best control approach is given. Finally, the Soft Actor-Critic method is combined with the improved LSBoost to create a DRL algorithm. 3.1 Improved LSBoost energy prediction algorithm The prediction of building energy use is generally a regression problem. The LSBoost integrated learning algorithm is used to fit the data into the building energy consumption data in Ke et al. (2020). Simultaneously, precise modifications to the LSBoost algorithm are developed to solve the method's flaws. The LSBoost algorithm is built around the following steps. The initial step is to create a tree model and execute feature splitting. First, a model f(x) must be fitted whenever a tree is built to decrease the prediction error; second, after finishing the training to get a k-tree, the score of each leaf node must be forecasted. Each tree will have a matching leaf node, and each leaf node will correlate to a score based on the features of the sample. Finally, the scores for each tree are added together and utilized as the sample's projected value. Now let us consider a dataset with N sets of observations, each containing s features and n outputs, written as a mathematical expression as follows: (1) x i : = [ x 1 i , x 2 i , \u2026 , x s i ] ∈ ℜ s y i : = [ y 1 i , y 2 i , \u2026 , x n i ] ∈ ℜ n i ∈ { 1 , 2 , \u2026 , N } LSBoost differs from Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) in that GBDT uses the Gini exponent for the tree splitting nodes, whereas LSBoost uses the least squared error as the loss function at the tree splitting nodes as in (2): (2) L ( y i , F ( x ) ) = 1 2 ( y i − F ( x i ) ) 2 where x i denotes the ith features set in the training set, y i is the corresponding observation in the training set x i , and F(x) is the current prediction data. The loss function here is not fixed but can be evaluated by the trained data to see how well it fits, and some metrics such as R-Squared, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to choose the appropriate loss function for the current data. LSBoost uses formula (2) as the loss function to facilitate the derivation of the data, simplify operations, reduce computational complexity, reduce training time, speed up system response and enhance robustness. Algorithm 1 is an improved LSBoost. By training the dataset, Algorithm 1 demonstrates a method for constructing an LSBoost controller. The input training data is Eq. (1), the number of training sessions is M, the loss function is Eq. (2), and the RT weak learner is built in the second step (B). v is the learning rate, ranging from 0 to 1, with a default value of 0.1. The final output is the F M ( x ) predicted value after M training sessions. The LSBoost algorithm solves the regression tree's problems of poor scalability and low prediction accuracy, but the LSBoost is fitted to the residuals and performs iterative weight learning. Overfitting occurs when fitting due to noise and useless features in the data. As a result, specific enhancements to the LSBoost algorithm are made in this work, based on the LSBoost method mentioned above. (1) The method for fitting residuals was improved by introducing a stochastic neural network model. (2) Eq. (2) is improved by adding standard terms and reducing the model dimensionality. (3) The stopped early mechanism was introduced to prevent the test set from being too large in error with the training set. This is done by 1) replacing (B) of the second step of LSBoost with a randomized neural network model at each boosting algorithm at m iterations during residual fitting (see (Fig. 2 ) below) and y ( x , w ) replaces F m − 1 ( x i ) + γ with: (3) y ( x , w ) = β 0 + ∑ i = 1 p β j x i + ∑ l = 1 l β l h ( ∑ i = 1 p w i , l x i ) + γ where l 1 , l 2 , l 3 is the leaf unit; β 0 β j β l is the neural network weight; x i is the input data; is extracted w from a pseudo-random U ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] sequence of fractions; p is the number of features and l is the number of samples. h ( ∑ i = 1 p w i , l x i ) the activation function is applied to x , w , and the choice of activation function for this scheme is the essential RELU activation function: (4) x → m a x ( 0 , x ) In addition, the second sub-step (C) of the LSBoost algorithm above is expressed by (5): (5) γ i m = argmin γ ∑ x i ∈ R i j L ( y i , F m − 1 ( x i ) + γ ) It can be rewritten as: (6) γ i m = argmin γ ∑ x i ∈ R i j L ( y i , y ( x , w ) ) 2) Formula (2) can be further improved by adding a regularization term, which translates into the following formula (7): (7) L ( y i , y ( x i , w i ) ) = ∑ i = 1 p 1 / 2 ( ( y i − y ( x i , w i ) ) 2 + ∑ l = 1 L Ω ( f l ) In Eq. (6), (8) Ω ( f l ) = γ T + 1 2 λ ∑ t = 1 T w t 2 Ω ( f l ) denotes the regular term for the ith tree. t is the number of leaves; l is the total number of trees, f l denotes the lth tree, and y ( x i , w i ) is the predicted value. 3) Thanks to introducing the stopped early mechanism, the LSBoost training process can be stopped as early as possible before m = M is reached, and the tolerance parameter η > 0 can be given by (8): (9) ∥ L ( y i , y ( x i , w i ) ) ∥ 2 2 < η 3.2 Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) The Soft Actor-Critic, which is based on reinforcement learning, has the benefit of being extremely scalable, allowing for the sharing of information to coordinate the behavior of numerous agents via a reward mechanism. The Soft Actor-Critic algorithm first constructs a neural network to represent Q and Policy in neural networks: Q θ ( s t , a t ) and π θ ( a t | s t ) . The Q network consists of a neural network with two hidden layers that output Q values. On the other hand, the policy network outputs a distribution that outputs the mean and confidence of a Gaussian variable. For the update of the Q network, it is obtained that: (10) J Q ( θ ) = E ( s t , a t , s t + 1 ) ∼ D [ 1 2 ( Q θ ( s t , a t ) − ( r ( s t , a t ) + γ V θ ¯ ( s t + 1 ) ) ) 2 ] = E ( s t , a t , s t + 1 ) ∼ D , a t + 1 ∼ π ϕ [ 1 2 ( Q θ ( s t , a t ) − ( r ( s t , a t ) + γ ( Q θ ¯ ( s t + 1 , a t + 1 ) − α log ( π ϕ ( a t − 1 | s t + 1 ) ) ) ) ) 2 ] Construct a target soft Q-network with parameters θ ¯ , θ obtained through the parameters of the Q-network. Then, update the Policy network parameters to minimize the KL scatter. The formula is shown in (11): (11) J π ( ϕ ) = D KL ( π ϕ ( . | s t ) ∥ exp ( 1 α Q θ ( s t , . ) − log Z ( s t ) ) ) = E s t ∼ D , a t ∼ π ϕ [ − log ( π ϕ ( a t | s t ) exp ( 1 α Q θ ( s t , a t ) − log Z ( s t ) ) ) ] = E s t ∼ D , a t ∼ π ϕ [ log π ϕ ( a t | s t ) − 1 α Q θ ( s t , a t ) + log Z ( s t ) ] Here the action we get using the re-parameterization technique is shown in (12): (12) a t = f ϕ ( ε t ; s t ) = f ϕ μ ( s t ) + ε t ⊙ f ϕ σ ( s t ) In the above formula, f is the function outputs the variance and the mean, which ε is the noise. Samples are drawn from this by calculating deterministic functions for the state and policy parameters and independent noise, which allows the expectation of the action to be rewritten as an expectation of the noise: (13) J π ( ϕ ) = E s t ∼ D , ε ∼ N [ α log π ϕ ( f ϕ ( ε t ; s t ) | s t ) − Q θ ( s t , f ϕ ( ε t ; s t ) ) ] In Eqs. (11) and (12), α ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) is a temperature hyperparameter. α Unlike the learning rate, it is the weight that controls the entropy term so that the α = 1 learner will prioritize the execution of random actions as much as possible and produce a random strategy that α = 0 will ignore entropy completely, yielding an almost deterministic strategy. For this work, we set the temperature to a constant value α = 0.2 . In order to be arithmetically accurate, the Q network and the policy network are built, and the one with the smaller Q value is chosen as the target Q value each time. Where Q is updated, Policy is used in Eqs. (10) and (13). The resulting complete Soft Actor-Critic network structure is shown in Fig. 3 . 3.3 Distributed optimization algorithms based on SAC The Reinforcement Learning control principle is as follows when applied to the control issue in multi-building energy management: the agent (e.g., the control module of a building management system) interacts with the environment (e.g., the building heating zone). When the environment is in a specific condition (for example, when the building is inhabited but the temperature is over the comfort limit), the agent takes action at each time step (e.g., sets the supply heating temperature). The agent receives a state observation accompanied by a consequence of that action, i.e., a reward or a punishment, to measure the agent's performance for its control goal. The Soft Actor-Critic starts with a state of the environment and attempts to determine the optimal control strategy that allows the accumulation and maximization of future rewards π. The RL algorithm evaluates the state and action functions to determine the optimal strategy. The key to the reinforcement learning algorithm is establishing the reward function based on the aforementioned computational concepts. The research creates the reward function from single and multiple buildings based on the unique operating features of buildings. Eq. (14) describes the incentive for buildings since the building's net power usage solely determines its value. (14) R 1 = sign ( e i ) · min { 0 , e i } 2 A reward function based on a virtual price signal (penalizing peak consumption) is created for multiple buildings, together with an artificial incentive mechanism for charging at night and discharging during the day to consider the coordination of electrical energy across buildings. (15) R 2 = ∑ j = 1 N ( β * e total * e i ) + R night + R day where : R night = { 100 , if 8 am ≤ hour ≤ 12 pm AND mean ( actions ) > 0.1 − 100 , if 8 am ≤ hour ≤ 12 pm AND mean ( actions ) < 0 0 , otherwise R day = { − 100 , if 12 pm ≤ hour ≤ 8 am AND mean ( actions ) > 0 0 , otherwise The Reward (R) function used is shown in formula (15), where β is a weighting factor (value of 0.005), N is the number of buildings in the area, e total and e i are the total electricity consumption of the area and the electricity consumption of the buildings. As previously stated, the multi-building reward and punishment function employ a reward mechanism for staggered electricity consumption to accurately describe the electricity consumption strategies of regional buildings, allowing this algorithm to more quickly achieve its goal of lowering building energy consumption. However, because the state of each building agent cannot grasp changes in the multi-building reward function, the above reward and punishment function enhances the unpredictability of the rewards. To address this problem, the remedy adopted in this paper is to share certain information between the agents that inform the actions chosen by each agent. As a result, the algorithm can predict more accurately what the next reward will be in the current state if they take a specific action. The reward each agent receives depends not only on its net electricity consumption but also on the total net electricity demand of the whole area. Therefore, we trained an improved LSBoost for each building, using a normalized subset of observations and the agents' behavior to predict the change in the net electricity consumption of the building at the next step and take that behavior (Fig. 4 ). Therefore, we trained an improved LSBoost for each building, using a normalized subset of observations o i and the agents' behavior to predict the change in the net electricity consumption of the building at the next step. In short, each time the action selection function is called, a randomly ordered collection of multi-agent actions is created A t . The algorithm starts running by having the first intelligent body on the list select an action via a neural network operation ( a i k ). Next, the algorithm takes the selected action and feeds it into an LSBoost model to predict the current building energy consumption ( e ^ i k ). In effect, the algorithm hypothesizes about how much electricity the building will consume if that action is taken and shares this information with neighboring agents. Afterward, each agent shares its predicted electricity consumption and the previous agent's action with the following agent ( e ^ i c u m ). So far, the agent's actions have been selected but have not yet been applied to the building body. When the traversal is complete for all the agents (all agents have selected their actions and shared their predicted power consumption with neighboring agents according to the same principles), the building agents construct a collection of actions A t , which carry out the execution of uniform actions. At each iteration, the algorithm described above creates a problem: the first agent that selects an action does not know the actions of the remaining agents, as it only contains information from the previous iteration, whereas the last agent whose behavior is selected has complete information. Thus, the agent near the beginning of the action selection set has less information, affecting the accuracy of the prediction of electricity consumption for that agent. To get rid of the above dilemma, a coordination variable is provided c i c u m . In first, each building is assigned an energy factor c i , which is the ratio of a rough estimate of the annual electricity consumption of the area, i.e., the relative weight of the building's energy use in the microgrid system. c i − 1 c u m is then the sum of all the energy coefficients of the buildings for which the previous action of the current building i was selected in the current iteration k. Thus, for the first agent in the set of actions: c 1 c u m = 0 , the last agent selected an action c n c u m ≈ 1 . c i c u m indicate how much potential energy consumption has been allocated to each building for its previous action selection. e ^ i c u m indicate how much energy is expected to be consumed by all other buildings. Thus, c i c u m each agent is provided with information that measures how accurate the current agent's energy consumption prediction is. If, in the last iteration, k = m, then c i c u m ≈ 1, the algorithm will consider this prediction more accurate because it predicted electricity consumption for the whole area. If c i c u m =0, agent 1 will be the first in the queue, and the prediction will not be very accurate because it uses the prediction of the first agent to calculate it. The detailed steps of the algorithm in Fig. 4. are shown in Algorithm 2 . Implementing this algorithm is different from the traditional reinforcement learning algorithms, which mainly contribute to state updates, including state variables and action variables, and add the coordination variables Γ. Therefore, the algorithm needs to encode the parameters of the agents based mainly on the observed data, including, mainly, Γ(t + 1) and state variables, as shown in Algorithm 3 . In Algorithm 3, the third step (A) allows the current building state, a set of observations, to be obtained from the environment. Then we encode them using various ways (Fig. 5 ) and modify them using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in step three (C) of the process to get the actual states that the reinforcement learning algorithm can identify (see the encoder block in Fig. 1). Fig. 5 depicts the observed variables that we used to generate the states, as well as the various ways in which the data was encoded. Finally, we use periodic One Hot to encode the variables and normalize the observed data. 4 Simulation and analysis Section 4 focuses on the feasibility analysis of the proposed DRL control strategy. It is expected to analyze the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed algorithm by comparing the control effects of DRL with those of RBC, SAC, MPC, and NSGA-Ⅱ algorithms for the nine campus buildings. Therefore, the structural information of the nine campus buildings is introduced first. Then, the structures, parameters, and formulas to be used by each algorithm are explained; subsequently, the energy consumption of the nine buildings for 10 days is compared and analyzed by the DRL, RBC, SAC, MPC, and NSGA-Ⅱ; finally, the advantages and disadvantages of each algorithm are analyzed by the energy consumption index. 4.1 Building description The data for nine public buildings was included in the dataset used, which includes data for eight campus buildings and one office building; see the paper for detailed data (based on Behl, Jain & Mangharam, 2016 and Table 1 ). Weather and electricity consumption data were collected for the eight buildings on the University of Pennsylvania campus. The campus building data was sourced from scientific research laboratory buildings, administration buildings, office buildings with lecture halls, and biomedical research facilities. These eight buildings have a total floor area of over 1.2 million square feet. In addition, building 9: Data from Building 101, a large office building located in Philadelphia, USA, was used as the temporary headquarters of the US Department of Energy's Building Energy Efficiency Innovation Consortium, a three-story building with a total floor area of 75,156 square feet. 4.2 MPC and genetic algorithm control strategy Since the proposed reinforcement learning control strategy differs from traditional optimization methods in model building, DRL is a model-free strategy that does not require building models. In contrast, MPC and GA optimization methods require state-space models by Capacitance-resistance equivalence (Picard, Jorissen & Helsen, 2015). The sampling interval for humidity, temperature, wind speed, light, and other sensors is 60 min in the sensor. Therefore, the discrete space expressions for the nine buildings are constructed as follows in (16) and (17): (16) x k + 1 m = A x k m + B u k m + E d k m m = 1 , 2 , . . . , 9 (17) y k m = C x k m + D u k m m = 1 , 2 , . . . , 9 In the above formula, x k m , u k m and d k m , respectively, represent the state, input, and disturbance variables at the ith moment of the mth building; y is the output variable; the model's sampling frequency is T s = 60 min . The disturbance signal d k m presents the heat absorbed and the direct and diffuse solar radiation transmitted by each window such as ambient and sky temperature, ambient temperature, and ground temperature. The control structure of the closed-loop system is constructed in Fig. 6 , where the controller is designed by MPC algorithm and GA algorithm to calculate the appropriate control quantity U, so that the building temperature is satisfied in the appropriate temperature zone. The reference input is a range, not a specific value, called the comfort zone When designing the controller. In this paper, we specify the upper limit of temperature between u b ∈ [ 23 , 26 ] and the lower limit of l b ∈ [ 20 , 23 ] using the ISO-7730 standard (Olesen & Parsons, 2002). Eq. (18) defines the mathematical expression for the temperature comfort zone. (18) l b k − s k ≤ y i , k ≤ u b k − s k with s is a slack variable, k is a time series, and y i , k represents the ith room temperature at time k. The control optimizer design aims to reduce building energy consumption as much as possible while satisfying human comfort. Therefore, a balance between optimal energy consumption and human comfort needs to be sought. In order to solve this problem, the control problem is transformed into an optimization problem. Subsequently, the objective function can be constructed as: (19) min u 0 , \u2026 , u N − 1 ∑ m = 1 9 ∑ k = 0 N − 1 ( Q s ∥ s k ∥ 2 2 + Q u ∥ u k ∥ 2 2 ) (20) s . t . x k + 1 m = A x k m + B u k m + E d k m m = 1 , 2 , . . . , 9 , k ∈ N 0 N − 1 (21) y k m = C x k m + D u k m m = 1 , 2 , . . . , 9 , k ∈ N 0 N − 1 (22) l b k − s k ≤ y k ≤ u b k − s k , k ∈ N 0 N − 1 (23) x 0 = x ( t ) (24) d 0 = d ( t ) In the above formula, N a b = { a , a + 1 , \u2026 , b } is a set of integers, x k m , u k m , y k m and d k m represent state, input, output, and disturbance variables, respectively. The prediction range is N, and k is the kth instant in the prediction range. Eqs. (20) and (21) are the time-invariant state-space expressions of the building (22). The lower boundary l b k and the upper boundary u b k are taken into consideration. Eqs. (23) and (24) set the initial parameters. Eq. (19) indicates that the objective function finally constructed by the optimization problem outputs a sequence u 0 , . . . , u N − 1 under the influence of 6 constraints so that the output control amount is minimized, the objective function ∥ · ∥ 2 2 represents the square of the second norm, s k is a slack variable, u k is a control variable, Q s represents the weight of human comfort, and Q u represents the weight of energy consumption. The weighting matrices Q s and Q u are given as positive definite diagonal matrices. Set it to Q s / Q u = 10 7 . The first term in the objective function is the square with the lowest degree of comfort violation, and the second term is the square with the lowest energy consumption. 4.3 Multi-algorithm simulation setting The prediction horizon is chosen as N = 30. The training set, validation set, and test set are 80%, 10%, and 10%, respectively. The initial value populations of the genetic algorithm are x 0 and d 0 . Before the simulation starts, the neural network parameters in Soft Actor-Critic need to be set, as shown in Table 2 . Next, the parameters of the LSBoost algorithm need to be set, as shown in Table 3 . Finally, the parameters used for training are set as detailed in Table 4 . Explain the types of actions in DRL: Cooling_storage: increase (action > 0) or decrease (action < 0) of the amount of cooling energy stored in the cooling storage device. −1/C <= action <= 1/C (attempts to decrease or increase the cooling energy stored in the storage device by an amount equal to the action times the storage device's maximum capacity). DHW_storage: increase (action > 0) or decrease (action < 0) of the amount of DHW stored in the DHW storage device. −1/C <= action <= 1/C (attempts to decrease or increase the DHW stored in the storage device by an amount equivalent to action times its maximum capacity). 4.4 Multi-algorithm energy consumption analysis To evaluate the methods proposed in Section 3.3 for multi-building energy consumption optimization. From the standpoint of energy consumption optimization, this section examines the influence of five algorithms (the DRL, SAC, RBC, MPC, NSGA-Ⅱ) on building energy usage. This article compares and contrasts the five algorithms in three areas: cooling equipment energy consumption, domestic water consumption, and overall building energy consumption for nine different structures. The energy consumption of cooling equipment and domestic water is chosen because action A used in the reinforcement learning algorithm includes cooling equipment and domestic water. The total energy consumption is calculated by the following formula (25): (25) E T o t a l = E Cooling + E DHW + E Appliance + E heating Finally, a more comprehensive analysis and simulation of the algorithm are carried out from these three perspectives. The algorithm's prediction period is 10 days, which means one episode every 10 days. Since the sampling interval is once every 60 min, there will be 240 points in an episode. According to the findings, short-term building energy prediction ensures algorithm accuracy while reducing computational complexity. Second, because the dataset indicates that energy consumption is highest during August and September, the simulation time range for this work is set between August 17 and August 27. Fig. 7 shows the energy consumption of the five algorithms for nine campus buildings over ten days, from the energy consumption of the cooling equipment. The RBC and SAC curves vary in sinusoidal style with a large amplitude. There is also negative energy consumption due to the system's built-in energy storage battery, which will be used first when electrical energy is consumed, and when the battery power is depleted, power will be supplied by AC power. Furthermore, it has been discovered that the genetic algorithm's fluctuation would be stable at around 1300KW, which is related to the system's control decision being more stable and difficult to change. However, balancing temperature and energy consumption can result in high energy consumption and difficulty finding the best option. Fig. 8 presents energy consumption from Domestic Hot Water (DHW) perspective for five algorithms and nine campus buildings spent over ten days. First, DRL is a type of machine learning that learns from data and experience. As a DHW supply, the DRL control technique primarily uses energy storage batteries. As a result, the graphic illustrates the DRL advantages over the other four algorithms. Second, the performance of MPC and the genetic algorithm NSGA-II on DHW is comparable to that of cooling energy consumption, which is more consistent and less variable. As a result, the NSGA-II control strategy has more evident benefits in terms of stability. The overall building energy usage of the five techniques for 10 days is represented in Fig. 9 . The design of the reward function is the most critical aspect of this study and solution. Fig. 9 shows that the method proposed in this paper uses less energy most of the time but uses more energy from the evening of the first day to the morning of the second day. The reason for this is that this research proposes a novel reward and punishment function that includes a staggering power consumption scheme, making it more cost-effective to use power during off-peak hours. Furthermore, the genetic algorithm performs excellently due to the method's high stability and consistent energy consumption, ensuring the safety of daily electricity usage. Table 5 compares the simulation results of the DRL suggested in Section 3.3 with those of the SAC, RBC, MPC, NSGA-Ⅱ algorithms for the five energy consumption. The simulation shows that when the temperature is at its highest during the summer months, both the method suggested in this paper and the classic SAC and RBC algorithms consume a lot of cooling equipment. In addition, to verify human comfort, the comfort index Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) was introduced to evaluate human comfort through thermal sensation, and the evaluation index is shown in Table 6 . The analysis of PMV metrics shows that SAC, RBC, MPC, NSGA II, and DRL control strategies all satisfy the MPV and meet the comfort condition. According to the analysis, the DRL algorithm uses less energy for cooling energy consumption, DHW energy consumption, and overall power consumption, than the SAC, RBC, MPC, NSGA II. Furthermore, the gains attributed to the distributed algorithm can consider the energy consumption weight of each building while allocating energy consumption, resulting in lower energy consumption. As a result, by altering the proportion of each building's energy consumption, the power consumption of cooling and DHW equipment may be modified in real-time to reduce the energy consumption of multiple buildings as much as possible and eliminate unnecessary energy losses. 4.5 Analysis of indicators Because the focus of this work has always been on building energy consumption, seven indicators have been provided to assess the current state of building energy consumption. They must be minimized via reinforcement learning for the controller. Each evaluation criteria is based on the overall non-negative net electricity usage of the entire neighborhood. A Energy consumption error: The sum of the absolute values of the errors in building energy consumption is sum ( | e ( t ) − e ( t − 1 ) | ) , where e ( t ) is the net non-negative electricity consumption at t. B Load Factor: The load factor is the average net electrical load divided by the maximum electrical load. C Average daily peak: the average daily peak demand. D Peak electricity demand: maximum peak electricity demand E Net power consumption: Total power consumption F Squared energy consumption: sum ( e ( t ) 2 ) where e is the net non-negative power consumption at moment t. G Overall evaluation of energy consumption: standardized average of indicators A-F As a result, while examining the system in terms of comprehensive indicators, the overall evaluation of indicator G energy consumption is the most important factor to consider, as shown in (26). The lower the overall energy consumption indicator, the lower the building's energy consumption. (26) G = A + B + C + D + E + F 6 Standardizing the rewards by dividing them by their standard deviation and subtracting their mean enhanced the results and allowed us to utilize the same hyperparameters across all agents. It is crucial to utilize constant mean and standard deviation values (or some estimations of them) during the simulation rather than recalculating them because this would invalidate previously acquired Q-values. After all, the new rewards would be standardized differently. In this approach, the system's overall metrics may be better explained. The G metrics in this research were then assessed for building energy consumption using five algorithms (SAC, RBC, MPC, NSGA-II, DRL), with the findings presented in Fig. 10 . The final results are shown in Table 7 . A comparison of the SAC, RBC, MPC, NSGA-II, DRL is shown for seven performance metrics. It can be seen that the distributed algorithm has the lowest overall energy consumption metric of 0.845, which is a decrease of 0.059, 0.155, 0.02, 0.009 compared to the SAC, RBC, MPC, NSGA-Ⅱ algorithms, respectively. 5 Conclusions This research shows how to design a regional building energy optimization method for rising energy consumption due to energy consumption coupling between many buildings using a distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning approach. In addition, the improved LSBoost algorithm was used to build the building's energy consumption model, which increased the prediction accuracy of the energy consumption model. Using PCA to decorrelate the states of the agents and reduce their dimensions, layer normalization of the critic networks to speed up training, and the Huber loss to avoid exploding gradients and oversensitivity to outliers in the critic networks were some of the other techniques we used to improve the agents' performance. First, in a multi-building energy consumption scenario, numerical simulations are used to verify the developed control technique for nine buildings. The results reveal that when compared to the RBC and SAC algorithms, the DRL reduces overall energy consumption by 6.72% and 3.67%, respectively, proving the success of the proposed strategies. Second, a quantitative study of seven factors was conducted: energy consumption error, load factor, average daily peak, peak power demand, net power consumption, energy consumption squared, and overall assessment. The investigation shows that the energy optimization strategies mentioned above are against the RBC and SAC algorithms in terms of accuracy. However, according to the quantitative and qualitative assessments, the DRL method is also scalable and offers good energy consumption optimization outcomes. Therefore, it can provide a viable control strategy for sustainable urban development. The advantages of using the distributed energy optimization system can therefore be summarized as follows, (1) System structure advantages. The fully decentralized distributed network has no central control section and multiple contacts between the nodes. (2) Sustainability and Scalability. The advantage of sustainability and scalability is mainly reflected in the coordination of neighboring agents, i.e., many agents share two variables with neighboring agents. Therefore, the regional building optimization system is not restricted to building scale. (3) Optimization of building energy decoupling. Compared to traditional reinforcement learning algorithms, the algorithm can coordinate the energy consumption between individual agents by sharing neighboring agent parameters. Although the simulation process for DRL has the advantages described above, there are certain limitations. Eqs. (1)\u2013(26) (1) The problem of learning efficiency, the more considerable the amount of data, the longer the training time. Reinforcement learning can theoretically be used for anything, including environments where the world model is unknown. However, this generality comes at a cost in that it is difficult for us to use it for any specific problem that helps us learn, which forces us to use many samples to learn, even though these problems may be solved with a simple method. (2) The agent's learning process is difficult to control, and high randomness is. It is mainly due to the difficulty in designing the reward function. Reinforcement learning algorithms are concerned with a continuous and uniform process that assumes that it knows more or less about its environment. The most widespread model-free reinforcement learning is similar to black-box optimization techniques in that it only allows certain assumptions to exist in the MDP, i.e., the agent is told that it will get a + 1 reward for doing so, and it has to figure out the rest on its own. Similarly, model-free reinforcement learning faces the same problem as black-box optimization techniques, that is, the agent will treat all the reward +1 s as positive, even though the +1 may be taken in an evil way. (3) The practicality of the current application scenario needs to be verified. There is no denying that Deep RL now seems to be a very new field, especially in building energy. Other than Google's reinforcement learning to reduce power generation in data centers, we are hard-pressed to find other Deep RL use cases of real value.

        "dc:description": "Model-free control approaches, such as Reinforcement Learning (RL), can be trained using historical data and therefore have the advantage of low cost and scalability. However, RL does not provide efficient, coordinated control for regional buildings, which leads to inter-building energy coupling, and thus resulting in higher energy consumption. This paper presents energy optimization strategies based on Distributed Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to reduce energy consumption in regional buildings while maintaining human comfort. The proposed strategy's system learns to regulate procedures to reduce building energy consumption through parameter sharing and coordination optimization. The energy optimization strategies are validated in this research by utilizing nine campus buildings as a case analysis. The results show that the system achieves the lowest total energy consumption with the employed strategies against the Rule-Based Control (RBC), Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) strategy, Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm Ⅱ (NSGA-Ⅱ). Furthermore, the proposed energy optimization strategies demonstrated good accuracy and robustness with a comprehensive evaluation of multi-building energy consumption in error analysis, load factor, power demand, and net power consumption.",
