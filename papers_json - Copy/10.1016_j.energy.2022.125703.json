Thermal comfort is of utmost importance in office buildings, which need the activation of heating systems at an optimal time. A high-performance NN predictive system requires a large training dataset. This can limit system efficiency due to the lack of enough historical data derived from thermal controllers. To address this issue, we generated, trained and tested a dataset of eight sizes using a calibrated building model. A set of key performance indicators (KPIs) was improved by studying the output performance. The effect of normalization and standardization preprocessing techniques on NN prediction ability was studied. Learning curves showed that a minimum of 1\u20134 months of data are required to obtain enough accuracy. Two heating seasons provide the optimal data size to calibrate the NN properly with high prediction accuracy. The results also revealed that building data from ≥two years slightly improve NN performance. The most accurate results in KPIs ( ≥ 90%) were obtained with preprocessed data. The effect of preprocessing on large training patterns was less than that of training patterns <100. Finally, NN model performance was less accurate in cold climate zones.

After a literature review of the most relevant articles in the field, the main barriers and challenges encountered by professionals of building energy management systems (BEMSs) can be summarized as: (i) a lack of extensive building operational data [5,7\u201310], (ii) a lack of fundamental knowledge and expertise [3,5], (iii) a lack of appropriate, user-friendly infrastructure [3] and (iv) a lack of justified cost and benefits [10], considering limited financial resources [5,6,11]. To tackle these challenges, control strategies based on a simple neural network (NN) with a basic architecture of 3\u20135 inputs, 1\u20132 hidden layers, and 1 output have become a promising approach [12\u201321]. They have been widely used to obtain knowledge from stored data and transform current reactive rule-based systems into predictive systems that could forecast future scenarios to optimize building operations [17,22,23]. The following are representative studies that incorporated the use of the NN predictive control system to optimize HVAC operations. Jang et al. [21] developed an NN-based prediction model using data collected by BEMS to predict the optimum heating timing. Afram et al. [22] developed and simulated an NN-based MPC controller that was compared to fixed set-points to analyze the potential energy saving. Sampaio et al. [4] applied an MPC approach that predicts building heat load and indoor temperature for tertiary sector buildings by optimizing set-point temperature. Accordingly, a NN can be applied to manage boiler operation in buildings. It determines the optimal start time of HVAC systems by utilizing BEMS data according to climatic conditions. Therefore it serves to achieve the expected thermal comfort levels when building occupants arrive in their workplace [12,18,21,24]. By way of example, Yang et al. [12,13] developed an optimized NN model to determine the optimal start time for a heating and cooling system in office buildings. Moon et al. [14\u201317] employed NN algorithms for the optimal application of set back and control of heating systems to improve thermal comfort and energy efficiency in different buildings. Macarulla et al. [18] used NN predictive control for boilers in a commercial building energy management system. Drgoňa et al. [19] introduced well-performing model predictive control for the building's HVAC systems. Katic et al. [20] presented NN predictive control for personalized heating systems. In recent years, several relevant research trends have been published that focus on the context of predictive control and its impact on energy efficiency and thermal comfort. The benefits of NN optimization control over manual scheduled-based control are reliable and accurate prediction, ease of implementation, energy savings in the range of 15\u201350%, and improving thermal comfort [21,25\u201329]. However, the application of NN is challenged by the lack of historical data needed to train the NN [9,30]. NN models are limited to the data volume and quality, so a large amount of real-world historical data from different seasons of the year are needed to train the building model [7]. For instance, Moon et al. [16] used 45 datasets for the optimized NN model. Yang et al. [12] optimized the NN by learning 100 datasets over three months. Macarulla et al. [18] obtained 145 datasets over six months to train the NN to implement predictive control. About 300 datasets obtained over two months were used by Jang et al. [21] to train an NN model to predict the optimum heating timing. Nevertheless, how much data is needed to train a NN is still unknown and remains an open question. To overcome the limitations of the existing literature, it is critical to study data dimensionality. This can lead to obtaining more accurate results with less temporal and computational cost. Another relevant issue observed in previous studies is that most researchers consider data preprocessing a requirement to improve NN control performance [12,13,18,21,24]. Basically, data collected from smart meters and sensors do not have sufficient quality due to outliers and noises. As a result, prediction accuracy needs to be improved by data preprocessing techniques. Preprocessing is an essential step before applying machine-learning methods to ensure a model's quality and high performance [31]. Conditioning of data (i.e., preprocessing data techniques such as normalization or standardization) raises the question of extra effort, considering cost versus benefits [32]. It makes NN modeling more robust, reduces the effects of variance on any type of NN model and increases the model's prediction accuracy [31,33]. Nevertheless, it remains unclear how well data processing methods can influence data sizes. In addition, an analytical comparison of preprocessing data techniques has not been formulated. Therefore, the effects of data preprocessing should be investigated to confirm whether the method that is chosen is appropriate or not, considering the amount of data required in an NN control system to optimize the boiler operation set-point. To bridge the gap between documenting field validations and data availability and utilization [5,34], the use of a simplified control system based on NN must be facilitated and generalized. More precisely, existing studies have no guidelines to identify the amount of data required to train an NN control system. In addition, there is no validation method to examine preprocessing data techniques and their performance in an NN control system. This necessity is associated with the importance of facilitation to achieve deployment of predictive controls at large scale, which is considered as a viable solution for occupants' comfort and energy efficiency. To the best of the authors\u2019 knowledge, the amount of data required to train an NN control system is selected in a certain proportion in most previous studies. Larger training sets are mostly recommended. These increase building facility management costs and the risk of complex building services, and are highly dependent on software, automation, control and sensors [35]. For this purpose, this research aimed to determine the optimal amount of data required to better train a simple architecture of NN control for preconditioning time in office buildings. In addition, the need for data preprocessing is evaluated and discussed. This objective covers smart-ready services (i.e., run-time management of HVAC systems), which are aligned with the smart readiness indicator rating [36]. To study the impact of preprocessing techniques on NN prediction, two common methods of normalization and standardization are selected to explore the effect of preprocessed inputs on the proposed NN model. Data preprocessing, in which data are transformed to reduce the impact of variance of the model, is used due to the sensitivity of NN models to the scale of the inputs and output [31]. In addition, key performance indicators (KPIs) provide evidence of the optimal data required to obtain a calibrated NN with enough accuracy to be implemented in a building and manage its boiler. Moreover, the proposed approach is applicable in actual buildings that require only the simple architecture of the NN model. It quantifies the data used by the control system and improves its generalization capability, with less computational cost and prior knowledge to work with. The remaining sections of this paper are structured as follows: Section 2 provides details of the methodology. Section 3 presents the results and discusses the number of cases required to train the NN and the performance of the proposed control system. Section 4 summarizes the conclusions and trends for future studies. 2 Methodology This section describes the methodology used to analyze the data required to train NN-based control. The method used in this paper is presented in Fig. 1 . First, historical data for one building was generated using four heating seasons of meteorological data and a calibrated, validated model. Second, the historical data was split into eight periods (Pi) with different lengths of time (see Table 2 ). Then, the NN structure was fitted for each period to generate eight scenarios. Finally, the trained NN models were implemented in the building model using a new year of meteorological data to evaluate the performance. The prediction errors and KPIs were used to assess the model's performance in different NN control scenarios. 2.1 Generation of historical data The building model used in this study is the third-order model presented by Bacher and Madsen [37], with a heating control system based on a schedule and a thermostat. The model represents an existing building model named FlexHouse located in Denmark, which is well developed and extended by Giretti et al. [38]. It is used as an abstract tool to represent the building's thermal behavior and better describe the building dynamics in the dataset [39] and to test the proposed control system in this study. The use of third-order models has been emphasized in other studies to model building heat dynamics [40,41]. In fact, this is a sufficiently calibrated model that was validated in previous studies and is feasible with the available data [37,38,42\u201344]. This modeling approach provides a quick evaluation of building energy performance that requires simple inputs [45]. The models better describe the building dynamics in the dataset [39]. Notably, increasing the complexity of the building model does not always guarantee a satisfactory increase in performance [46]. Accordingly, a sufficient model could be key to developing a user-friendly applicable control system. The thermal model is based on a resistor-capacitance (RC) network analogy with the structure presented in Fig. 2 . The model is formulated for separate building parts to simulate the indoor temperature: - Interior: the interior represents the indoor air, modeled as heat capacity (Ci). - Heater: the heater is the element that provides heat to the interior of the building. This part is modeled as heat capacity (Ch), thermal resistance to the interior (Rih) and energy flux (Ph). In this study, the heater energy flux is controlled with a schedule for system operation and a feedback control signal to implement thermostatic control of the heating system on indoor temperature (Ti). - Solar: the solar part represents the heat input from solar radiation and is modeled by global irradiance (Ps) multiplied by the effective window area (Aw). - Envelope: the envelope represents the physical separator between the conditioned and unconditioned environment of the building. This element is modeled with a heat capacity (Ce) and thermal resistance to the interior (Rie) and the ambient (Rea). - Ambient: the ambient represents the exterior of the building and is indicated by the ambient air temperature (Ta). The conceptual structure of the reduced-order model was implemented in the Modelica simulation-based environment using the Modelica Thermal library [47] (see Fig. 3 ). The Modelica model was arranged into four main components: building, heating system, control system and weather. The building component implements the conceptual schema's interior, solar and envelope parts (see Fig. 2). The heating system block implements the element heater from the conceptual schema in Fig. 2. The control system implements the system operation schedule to regulate the on/off switch and a thermostat to regulate the heat gain. It follows the desired set-points using the on/off controller component from the Modelica library with a bandwidth of 0.5 °C. Finally, the weather component provides solar radiation and external temperature. In this study, four years of climatic data (2015\u20132019) were obtained from Meteocat for a location in Catalunya \u201cVila-rodona automatic operational station (DQ)\u201d (Dades de l'estació automàtica Vila-rodona | Meteocat). Climate data is used to simulate the interior temperature of the building. Vila-rodona is located in a warm Mediterranean climate zone in the province of Tarragona. The average maximum and minimum temperature of this location has been reported at 21.7 °C and 10.7 respectively with global solar radiation of 16.5 MJ/m2 [48]. Data consisting of time series climate variables were recorded as follows: - Ta: ambient temperature (°C) - Ps: global solar radiation (W/m2) The daily operation of a building's energy manager was simulated by applying fixed schedule control. The building was considered occupied during working hours from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. and assumed to be unoccupied on weekends. Within occupied hours, the boiler schedule was set manually. Before starting the working day's operation, it turns on to meet thermal comfort requirements using a scheduled on/off control system. Based on the simulation, the boiler's schedule was adjusted to ensure thermal comfort at the beginning of the working day and to achieve the desired temperature of 21 ± 0.5 (see Fig. 3). According to Thermal Environmental Conditions for Human Occupancy and the adaptive comfort model of ASHRAE 55\u20132020 [49] (https://www.ashrae.org), a desired thermal comfort level is recommended between the lower and upper set-point temperature (Tcomf = 19.5\u201324.5). The internal temperature was simulated using the calibrated model and the meteorological data. 2.2 Development of neural network prediction model The NN model was used to determine the time needed to condition the building (Tp) to manage the boiler schedule. Although the choice of input data, neurons and hidden layers are critical aspects, there is no science for this, and it is a matter of trial and error [50]. This study used a simple NN architecture proposed by Macarulla et al. [18] as a starting point, as shown in (Fig. 4 ). It consists of one output, the time needed to condition the building at the desired temperature; one hidden layer (Ni) with ten neurons; and three inputs, the average internal temperature (Ti), the external temperature (Ta) and the difference between the desired temperature and the current internal temperature (ΔT) (see Table 1). This NN model's optimization factors are learning rate, number of hidden layers, number of nodes and bias [12]. NHi boxes are the weighted sum of the three inputs and the bias. Each NHi box has its weights (wNHi,j) and bias (bNHi) Eq. (1). The activation function is the hyperbolic tangent of each NHi, which is calculated using Eq. (2). Then, the output was calculated as the sum of the multiplication of 10 neurons by the weight of each neuron ( L w i ) and the bias Eq. (3). (1) N H i = ∑ j = 1 3 ( i n p u t j × W N H i , j ) + b N H i (2) tanh i = e N H i − e − N H i e N H i + e − N H i (3) o u t p u t = ∑ i = 1 10 ( tanh i × L w i ) + b o u t p u t Scikit-learn and Keras, which are python libraries for machine learning, were applied to create the structure of the NN and calculate the weight of the layers. The more optimal the coefficients, the better the prediction results, which are determined by training algorithms such as the back propagation-learning algorithm. To update network weights based on training data, the Adam optimization algorithm was used to minimize the errors of the predicted values. Data preprocessing techniques are effective and widely applied to clean datasets [33], reduce modeling errors [32] and identify outliers, since outliers must be filtered out from input variables [51]. For this reason, this model investigated the impact of preprocessing of input values to train the NN. It evaluated the model's performance using original unscaled data to learn the NN and compare the results with preprocessed data. It is essential to mention that when the input is preprocessed, the output will have to be preprocessed during training and postprocessed when the NN will make predictions with that approach. In this step, two data preprocessing techniques were used considering outlier data, which could be part of historical data, to train the model: - Normalization transforms the input values to the interval [0, 1] (see Eq. (4)) and the output to its main range (see Eq. (5)). (4) I n p u t 1 = ( T i c u r − T i min ) ( T i max − T i min ) (5) t p = o u t p u t × ( t r max − t r min ) + t r min - Standardization transforms the input values to a range with zero mean and a standard deviation of 1 (see Eq. (6) and (7)). (6) I n p u t 1 = ( T i c u r − M e a n T i ) s t d T i (7) t p = o u t p u t × s t d t r + M e a n t r The data generated in the previous section were divided into eight timing periods (Pi) (see Table 2) to obtain a database to create training patterns to train the NN control-based model. The training data included the input and target output values used to begin training a NN control system [24]. The number of training patterns to train the NN model were 22, 44, 88, 175, 330, 525, 650 and 1955. This means one month of data equals 22 training patterns, since one training pattern was created from each day. For each scenario (Pi) in Table 2, 70% of the data were used for training, comprised of Ta, Ti, Tp, and ΔT. The remaining 30% of the data were used for testing and validation to assess the performance of the trained NN. At the end of this process, eight NN models were obtained to manage boiler set-point. Larger training datasets decrease the probability of overfitting [20], while the generation of a suitable amount of data will overcome the limitation of using historical data [20,52]. Finally, more 7-heating seasons of data were generated with an unsynchronized meteorological data calendar and the boiler's calendar (see Fig. 5 ). This means that the boiler's calendar remained constant (i.e., Day 1 became Day 1), and the meteorological data's calendar was shifted one day (i.e., Day 1 became Day 2). This process was completed twice more to create scenario number 8 in Table 2. 2.3 Implementation in simulated scenarios The initial model (Fig. 3) was modified from a scheduled system to an intelligent NN control system with an NN algorithm and a thermostat inside a Modelica simulation-based environment. This proposed model dynamically schedules the boiler to predict the required time to achieve thermal comfort at the start of the next working day. To implement NN in simulated scenarios, the proposed control algorithm (see Fig. 6 ) was implemented in a Modelica simulation-based environment using the components in Fig. 7 . It was calculated in 30-min time steps to carry out the predictive control. Fig. 7 comprises the NN model's installation to predict the heating system's running time. This model was conducted according to the following components in Modelica. First, inputs to the NN model needed to be presented to proceed with the prediction. The variables contemplated in this study as inputs were: - Indoor temperature: internal temperature is retrieved from the thermostatic control system simulation. - Ambient temperature: this variable is obtained from meteorological data of the automatic operational station. - Set-point: the heating set-point is a scheduler that controls and maintains the indoor temperature in office buildings at the desired temperature of 21 °C. It is regarded as an input variable of the NN predictive model. - Time remaining: this schedule is assumed to be the time remaining (tr) to start the next working day. It is considered an input of the NN control system. The prediction is compared with the time remaining until the start of the next working day. - Boiler rest: this schedule is considered an input to turn off the boiler at the end of the working day (6 p.m.), to reduce energy consumption. Modelica components to implement the proposed control system are as follows: - NN control system: NN control was designed for predictive purposes to achieve the optimal start time for the heating system. The controller uses the predefined NN model structure to predict the time required to condition the building before starting the occupied hours. This control system compares the output of the NN model (tp) with the time remaining (tr). If tp > tr, the result will be true to turn on the boiler. - Thermostat: the thermostat setting ensures the comfort level in the building compared to the desired temperature of 21 °C. Set-point and simulated indoor temperature are defined input values in the thermostat control system. - Switch 1: this object is a conditional controller. This switch will shut down the boiler when the object \u201cboiler rest\u201d is true. Otherwise, it will turn on or off according to the NN condition. - Switch 2: this object represents when the boiler should be turned on, then the thermostat regulates the power (Ti < 21 ± 0.5 °C). - Switch 3: in this object, exclusively, the conversion of the Boolean to the real input occurs using the constant values of zero and one. This follows the final command issued in Switch 2 because all three switches operate consecutively. Finally, the output is defined: - Control action: the final command is to turn the boiler on or off. If both the conditions are met, the boiler will be turned on to start heating. Otherwise, the same procedure will be repeated at a 30-min interval to ultimately find the optimal starting point. The trained NN model in Section 2.2 was implemented in the model presented in Fig. 7, by applying the Modelica FMU library package as a simulator. NN-trained scenarios (see Table 2) were assessed using a new heating season of meteorological data to evaluate their performance. Modelica model setups vary for each scenario. Thus, the NN structure needs to be updated since the weights of the NN are different for each scenario (see Fig. 7). 2.4 Key performance indicators to assess the performance of neural network control To evaluate the performance of NN control in simulated scenarios, the models were validated using a dataset one heating season different from those used to train the NN. In this section, KPIs were defined to represent the performance of the NN control system (Table 3 ), considering the number of training patterns that directly affect them. The KPIs used in this study assessed the performance of the NN controls trained with different sizes of training patterns as follows: - Time with comfort %: is the duration of time in terms of hours on working days (Monday to Friday from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.) when the indoor temperature is between the range 19.5 and 24.5 °C. - Time with desired temperature %: is the duration of time in terms of hours on working days (Monday to Friday from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.) when the indoor temperature is in the desired temperature range (Td = 21 ± 0.5). - Days with start comfort %: the number of working days (Monday to Friday) when we achieve comfort (Tcomf = 19.5\u201324.5) at the beginning of working hour 8 a.m. - Days with a start desired temperature %: is the number of working days (Monday to Friday) when the indoor temperature is in the desired temperature range (k = 21 ± 0.5) at the beginning of working hour 8 a.m. - Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): (8) R M S E = ∑ ( A c t u a l t i m e − P r e d i c t e d t i m e ) 2 Eq. (8) defined the actual time as the real-time required to achieve the desired temperature before starting the working hour when the boiler is turned on. Meanwhile, the predicted time is the time predicted by the NN control system to turn on the boiler to achieve the desired temperature before the start of the working hour. 2.5 Climate data for neural network model validation Indeed, the knowledge of local weather data is the boundary condition and key input parameter of building energy modeling [45]. Owing to the fact that the reference building model in this study is a reduced third-order model, developed on Modelica libraries that are based on the reduced-order calculation method, we overcome the challenges and limitations by the use of data-driven models that are limited to a specific location and building type. To test the performance of the proposed NN control system, the simulated model carried out in different climate typologies (i.e., Boí \u201ccold Mediterranean\u201d, Malgrat de Mar \u201cwarm Mediterranean\u201d and Girona \u201cmild Mediterranean\u201d), one year of climate data \u201cheating season\u201d was used for the same period (2019\u20132020) from meteo.cat, the Meteorological Service of Catalonia in Spain. Data consist of time series climate variables recorded as Ta \u201cambient temperature (°C)\u201d and Ps \u201cglobal solar radiation (W/m2)\u201d. The average maximum and minimum temperature of Boí were reported as 5.9 and −0.2 °C respectively with global solar radiation of 15.9 MJ/m2 [53]. Furthermore, in Malgrat de Mar, the average maximum and minimum temperature were reported as 21.2 and 10.4 °C respectively with global solar radiation of 16 MJ/m2 [54]. In Girona these values were 22.8 and 7.7 °C, corresponding with global solar radiation of 15.5 MJ/m2 [55]. 3 Results & discussion The current work analyzes the results of simulation and optimization scenarios implemented through preliminary tests. The key contributions of this research are summarized as follows. All KPIs follow the same trend in terms of performance in general. The results indicate that increasing the number of training patterns improves the model's efficiency. Therefore, the dimensionality of data is significantly important to enhance the model's prediction, precision and accuracy. The learning curve of efficiency and performance of the NN model remained convergent in all preprocessing techniques when training patterns were ≥ 330. This value can be considered as the data size threshold required to achieve a high predictive system. Accordingly, Table 4 illustrates the identified outliers' results and the classified categories of all KPI variables in three scenarios. Each scenario was implemented and tested by the proposed NN model to investigate how data preprocessing approaches and data dimensionality affect the model's performance. The red highlighted area indicates a lower percentage of desirability with fewer data points (i.e., 22\u201388 training patterns). The desirability percentage increases with a medium amount of data in the yellow highlighted areas. Finally, the green areas indicate a remarkable decrease in the rate of desirability variation and an increase in data convergence. The behavior of scalers on the dataset shows that the outlier proportions decline in each scenario due to increasing data. The results also show that the classified categories are reasonable and consistent in this study. Better results were observed in the unscaled method in general for the KPI variables. However, the measurements only differ slightly in the values, and the improvement varies for different preprocessing techniques. The detailed results show that with varying lengths of historical data, the prediction accuracy increases, but RMSE does not vary significantly with the difference in preprocessing techniques. Generally, Table 4 shows that the model can obtain the most accurate results in terms of KPIs ≥ 90% with normalized and standardized data. Then, the results demonstrated that the two strategies do not improve the accuracy of models in this study. To conclude, the model's performance with a more significant amount of data leads to growing and fluctuating patterns. This can eventually result in the predictive system's convergence and desirability. In particular, Fig. 8 displays the data presented in Table 4. The \u201cideal\u201d learning curve has two relevant points: (1) PSOL, the point of starting online learning, and (2) PSL, the point of stopping learning. PSOL occurs when the accuracy of the NN predictions is enough to be implemented in a building but there is potential for improvement. According to the results, PSOL occurs in the range of 1\u20134 months of data. At this point, all KPIs are over 80%. PSL occurs in two years of historical data (16 months) when the KPIs achieve their maximum value (around 90%). These two points delimitate three regions: (i) a region when it is not recommended to implement the control system based on NN in a building because the performance of the system is low; (ii) a region when the control system based on NN can be implemented in a building but should continue to be trained, and (iii) the last region that is when the control system based on NN reaches its maximum performance, and the training should stop to avoid generalization problems. More specifically, when the NN model needs to be implemented without a large amount of historical data, reduced-order models should be built to create adequate training data. This guarantees prediction accuracy [56]. Therefore, it is expected that the NN model could be trained with fewer data samples in the absence of sufficient historical data. The effect of the two kinds of data-preprocessing techniques was investigated in the proposed NN control system. Table 4 compares the KPI results of each technique to determine the efficiency of the proposed control strategy. Standardization and normalization techniques illustrate a sharp increase (see Fig. 9 ). This is to be expected, as the need for data preprocessing on a limited number of training patterns (<100) significantly increases the model's accuracy compared to a model without scaling. In addition, where the number of training patterns increases, its effectiveness in achieving the desired result was reduced and caused a slight increase with no particular growth in accuracy. Furthermore, the results presented in Table 4 were plotted in Fig. 10 . On the left, the scatter plot shows the calculation of the predicted time to achieve the desired temperature at the start of the working hours. Highlighted red points are the outliers that represent R-squared (R2) in this regression model. The maximum and minimum values represent data outliers based on the calculated errors. Different parameters such as global maximum, global minimum and highlighted errors can be determined within a given range of box plots in various scenarios. Accordingly, we obtained Max = 0.78, Min = −1.2 in unscaled scenarios, Max = 1.1, Min = −1.4 in standardized scenarios, and Max = 1.5, Min = −1.3 in normalized scenarios. Among eight scenarios, the reduction in the number of outliers was visible by increasing the number of training patterns. On the right side of the scatter plot, the error points indicate the trend of errors in one scenario obtained from the validation data simulation. The positive errors reveal that predicted values are less than the time required to achieve the desired temperature in real conditions. When the boiler was turned on late due to a prediction error, we could not reach the desired temperature of 21 °C before working hours started in the morning. In this case, negative errors occurred when the NN predicted more time and the boiler was turned on earlier. Thus, the desired temperature was achieved before the start of the working hours. Moreover, the errors were mainly within the large horizon predictions (ΔT), considering the fact that the optimal set-point was greatly affected by external temperature. Fig. 11 shows the monthly errors based on the external temperature. Outlier data were found in December, January and February and on weekends in Oct and May since the predicted values differed from the actual values. They mainly occurred in December, January and February due to the lowest ambient temperature. An analysis of the errors revealed that we are losing performance accuracy mostly on Mondays since the boiler was turned off over the weekends. As a result, the internal temperature is lower than expected to achieve comfort at the start of working hours on Monday (large horizon predictions, ΔT). Therefore, it is crucial to suggest measures to reduce the number of errors on Mondays. This problem will be tackled by generating more training patterns to improve performance on Monday mornings. More data enables NN to deal with accurate predictions in the set-point temperature to prevent a large amount of energy consumption and higher discomfort values. Advanced control systems such as NN-based controls admittedly have limitations and are also dependent on weather conditions and building types. This control system operates reasonably in similar office buildings, which tend to be occupied during working hours with similar heating conditions. Using a simulated building model compared to a real environment, the model prediction performance and accuracy could operate differently. The complexity of the NN model is not too high, although real building systems hardly obtain data [4]. The most challenging limitation to conducting a real-world trial is the time needed to store the real desirable data to implement a satisfactory NN control system. Other climatology may affect the field validation of the NN model in real buildings. To move beyond the obstacles and facilitate the data requirements, this study advises the need for one to four months of data to apply MPC to reach the stage of demonstration in real buildings. Predicting the performance of buildings as complex energy systems is full of uncertainties [57]. This is because the simulation of building models is sophisticated, especially in the absence of real-world measured data. Therefore, most results rely on the model's uncertain data inputs and precision [58]. To compare the findings of this study with other building typologies and to verify whether the model performance is limited to a specific location and building type, a reduced-order building description as a benchmark model of building energy simulation can be used for future studies to demonstrate NN-based control's effectiveness in managing heating systems. This study proposes a comprehensive analysis of data preprocessing methods and the effects on training patterns with different time durations. Furthermore, the potential results of the simulated building model and its validation in different climate zones have been analyzed. Previous studies focused on a single topic: the application of several types of predictive control systems in residential and non-residential buildings with a certain proportion of historical data. In contrast, this study helps to break the barrier of the use of NN control system performance and to promote the actual application of advanced control systems. As can be seen in Fig. 12 , to compare the performance of NN-based control in different locations and climate zones, and to verify the results through simulation and historical climate data, the proposed NN control system was applied to examine the KPIs\u2019 variation. The NN model was validated for a similar heating season of the year for three new climate zones. The validation results revealed that in a warm climate, in Malgrat de Mar (WT), the proposed NN control was well regulated and operated efficiently (RMSE = 0.37). This was also true in Girona in a mild climate (RMSE = 0.70). The performance of the NN control system in a cold climate zone, Boí (Z2), was not as efficient as in a warm climate (RMSE = 2.32). In addition, these results demonstrate the effect of ambient temperature on the accuracy of the control system, which is aligned with previous studies [18,21]. There are some possible reasons for these results, including a low number of training patterns in colder months or climates, as the events observed on Mondays. Fig. 13 indicates that in cold climates, variance increases when a longer time horizon is predicted, which is highlighted by the red error lines in hours. The NN model learns with a wide variance initially, and does not increase as noticeably as the warm climate. In a cold climate, larger predictions caused underestimation and the performance of the model decreased due to the observed KPIs. 4 Conclusion This study discussed the optimal amount of data required to train a simple architecture of NN control to facilitate the implementation of predictive controls. For this purpose, a calibrated building model was used to implement an NN control system. The NN control turns on the boiler each day at an optimum time. This can provide the expected thermal comfort levels when occupants of the building arrive at their workplace. Eight NN models were trained using various training patterns of different time duration, which were implemented and tested in the calibrated building model. Then, a set of KPIs was used to assess each NN model's performance. In addition, three data preprocessing approaches were presented and compared to demonstrate model performance in each KPI. From the authors' perspective, the results of the study revealed that: \u2022 Followed by a discussion about the association between the amount of data required and NN control performance, an NN control system requires a minimum of 1\u20134 months of historical data to obtain enough accuracy to be implemented in buildings and two years of historical data to obtain the maximum performance. More than two years of historical data improves the performance of the NN. However, the improvement is only slight. \u2022 According to the results of this study, to the best of the authors' knowledge, preprocessing of data increases the performance of NN control when the training patterns are more minor (<100). However, it could help to enhance the accuracy of the NN prediction model. Data preprocessing techniques should be employed with circumspection and are not always recommended. They do not improve NN control's performance with large datasets based on the obtained results. \u2022 The results also revealed that NN control underestimates the time required to heat the building on Mondays in colder months. This is due to the existing low number of training patterns to learn the system's dynamics and thus enable large horizon predictions. In addition, the influence of the number of training patterns varies for different days of the week. The proposed NN control system operates intelligently during working days by performing predictions considering the time remaining until the start of the next day. In this case, the sufficient training set volumes improve the prediction performance on working days. Further research is required to investigate whether NN controls can improve performance in large horizon predictions. \u2022 From the validation results, it can be concluded that the performance of NN control model in a cold climate zone is not as efficient as in warm climate. Since the control system is not designed to be adapted to extreme values with low ambient temperature, it causes lower accuracy of heating system operation. Overall, in the examined cases, it is crucial to implement an efficient HVAC control system in the different climate zones because of changes in heating and cooling set-point, to avoid excessive temperatures. Practitioners such as building energy mangers can use the research results to find out how much historical data is required to implement an NN control system and if preprocessing techniques are required. Most of the previous studies on the application of NN to predict the optimal start time for the heating system focused on developing an optimized NN model using different amounts of data for training. This study set out to analyze the optimal amount of data required to train a simple NN model that works efficiently to predict the time needed for preheating office buildings. Several of our findings aligned with previous studies conducted in the non-residential context (i.e., office buildings), in which NN model accuracy depends on the climate, preprocessing of input data and environmental conditions. We could identify new findings, which included identifying the minimum relevant required amount of historical data to facilitate the application of NN controls and improve building energy efficiency. The scope of this research is limited to applying a simple NN architecture in BEMS to solve the problem of the implementation of predictive control for heating systems. Therefore, the results of this study will contribute to facilitating the implementation of NN predictive control to predict heating start time and gain thermal comfort.

        "dc:description": "Simple neural network (NN) architecture is a reliable tool to transform reactive rule-based systems into predictive systems. Thermal comfort is of utmost importance in office buildings, which need the activation of heating systems at an optimal time. A high-performance NN predictive system requires a large training dataset. This can limit system efficiency due to the lack of enough historical data derived from thermal controllers. To address this issue, we generated, trained and tested a dataset of eight sizes using a calibrated building model. A set of key performance indicators (KPIs) was improved by studying the output performance. The effect of normalization and standardization preprocessing techniques on NN prediction ability was studied. Learning curves showed that a minimum of 1\u20134 months of data are required to obtain enough accuracy. Two heating seasons provide the optimal data size to calibrate the NN properly with high prediction accuracy. The results also revealed that building data from ≥two years slightly improve NN performance. The most accurate results in KPIs ( ≥ 90%) were obtained with preprocessed data. The effect of preprocessing on large training patterns was less than that of training patterns <100. Finally, NN model performance was less accurate in cold climate zones.",
