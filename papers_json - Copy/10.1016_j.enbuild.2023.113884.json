Karlsruhe Institute of Technology Karlsruhe Baden-Wuerttemberg Germany One of the major challenges with increasing penetration of renewable energy sources (e.g., solar and wind) is to maintain grid stability. Grid-interactive efficient buildings are regarded as a promising approach to advance the role buildings can play in energy system operations and planning. This paper evaluates the demand flexibility in a residential building located in Karlsruhe, Germany, incorporating multiple distributed energy resources, including a photovoltaic and battery system, an electric vehicle, an electric water heater and a heat pump. A multi-criteria optimization problem is formulated with model predictive control (MPC) for five cases of demand flexibility. The simulation results of five winter days show that the peak power during the peak periods can be reduced by 92%, 69%, 100%, and 100% for real-time pricing, demand limiting, load shedding, and load shifting, respectively. For the power tracking scenario, the MPC tracked the reference power profile successfully for 70% of the simulation time. Achieving demand flexibility does not necessarily cause an increase in energy costs.

Among these strategies, grid-interactive efficient buildings stand out as a promising approach to optimize energy use with distributed energy resources (DERs), such as demand response, photovoltaic (PV) systems and battery storage, and advance the role buildings can play in energy system operations and planning [1]. As one important piece constituting the strategy of grid-interactive efficient buildings, demand flexibility refers to the capability of DERs to dynamically adjust their energy consumption and production patterns in response to grid conditions, weather forecasts, and price signals. By harnessing this flexibility, buildings can effectively align their energy usage with periods of abundant renewable energy generation, thereby optimizing energy utilization and reducing dependency on conventional fossil-fuel-based energy sources. Certainly, a single building, especially for residential, has negligible impact on the power grid. That is why a number of studies [2\u20134] explored the effects of demand flexibility at the scale of residential communities. Independent of the scale of demand flexibility, each individual building must be capable of managing DERs in response to the signal sent by the utility, demand response providers or aggregators. Therefore, this paper focuses on the demand flexibility of a single residential building. There exist many studies on the definitions, metrics, general strategies and quantification and characterization methods for demand flexibility in buildings. For example, Chen et al. [5] reviewed the strategies for demand response in grid-interactive buildings. Aiming to develop a systematic methodology to improve and evaluate the energy flexibility of buildings, they defined key parameters and resources related to energy flexibility in buildings and investigated how buildings could be effectively equipped to adapt their energy usage in response to dynamic demand conditions. Luo et al. [6] reviewed the definitions of demand flexibility (DF), the capabilities and operating characteristics of flexible loads, the models and evaluation methods for flexibility quantification for residential buildings. However, they defined the demand flexibility narrowly from the perspective of building electrical loads only, excluding the consideration of on-site power generation and energy storage. Li et al. [7] reviewed residential building demand-side management and conducted a literature review including 85 selected papers, identifying research trends and characterizing and quantifying energy flexibility. Regarding DF application, they found that load shifting and shedding were the most prevalent approaches and occupant comfort was considered only in half of the studies. These studies are important to help understand the basics of demand flexibility, but they do not directly address the approaches to implement and realize the flexibility of building energy needs. Building energy management for demand flexibility can be realized through three different approaches: rule-based control, model-based control, and data-driven control. Rule-based control (RBC) strategies are characterized as simple but generally applicable domain knowledge, and they have been used in many studies. According to the information used for making control decisions, RBC can be classified into momentary RBC and predictive RBC. Momentary RBC specifies the rules based on the current values of the boundary conditions or state variables. Examples of using momentary RBC for demand flexibility can be found in Dengiz et al. [8], Salpakari and Lund [9], and Pallonetto et al. [10]. In contrast, the predictive RBC makes decisions based on both current and future predictions of boundary conditions or state variables. Examples of using predictive RBC for demand flexibility can be found in Alimohammadisagvand et al. [11] and Clauß et al. [12]. Model-based control, particularly model predictive control (MPC) has gained considerable popularity in building control research including building energy management for demand flexibility. Finck et al. [13] combined the use of an artificial neural network (ANN) and MPC to control a residential building. The ANN was used to model the building behavior. The MPC was implemented to optimize demand flexibility through economic incentives. They conducted a day-long experimental test and demonstrated the capability of their ANN-MPC approach to maximize the demand flexibility via the passive building thermal storage. In a later study, Finck et al. [14] further demonstrated the use of MPC in regulating demand flexibility in an occupied residential building equipped with a solar-assisted heat pump system for space heating and domestic hot water (DHW). They used day-ahead prices to optimize the energy consumption for the next day and imbalance prices to optimize the energy consumption for the next hour. Kim et al. [15] proposed a two-level hierarchical MPC for load shifting in buildings equipped with multi-staged air conditioning units. The upper level MPC deals with electric load shifting in response to a price signal while the lower level MPC coordinates compressor stages to eliminate unnecessary peaks. They demonstrated via laboratory tests the effectiveness of MPCs to optimize load shifting and discussed the tradeoff between demand flexibility and energy efficiency. Nagpal et al. [16] applied a stochastic MPC to dispatch a comprehensive set of energy devices for the optimal energy management of smart sustainable buildings. They incorporate an adaptive sustainability criterion to ensure environmental goals are not compromised for financial benefits. The model addresses uncertainties in solar irradiance and ambient temperature through chance constraints, employing mixed-integer linear programming solved by model predictive control. Validation through a case study demonstrates the framework's effectiveness in cost management and maintaining the smart sustainable buildings' nearly-zero energy status, i.e. balancing annual on-site renewable production and energy consumption. Zhang et al. [17] compared an MPC to a RBC approach for the energy flexibility of residential buildings, particularly in space heating systems. Energy flexibility was defined as the energy change against a reference scenario during a demand response event. Their simulation results revealed that MPC outperformed the RBC in terms of flexible energy and maximum power reduction during demand response events but consumed more energy. Joe et al. [18] evaluated the potential of using building thermal mass for demand flexibility by applying an MPC with different indoor temperature comfort bounds, tariff structures, and prediction horizons. The MPC achieved 3.2%-23.3% cost saving depending on the parameter settings. Sasaki et al. [19] developed an MPC-based energy management system model to realize the optimal operation of multiple distributed energy resources such as fuel cell, heat pump water heater, PV, battery, and water storage tank. The MPC-based system enabled an operation scheme for the interactions between an aggregator and the associated prosumers. Li et al. [20] applied MPC to two Japanese zero energy houses. The energy flexibility provided by the space heating system achieved about 20% improvement in PV self-consumption. Thorsetinsson et al. [21] presented a four-month field study demonstrating a hierarchical MPC scheme on an occupied single-family house featuring an air-to-water heat pump and radiant floor heating. The controller comprises three layers: an upper layer that is aware of the energy assets and their externalities, a middle layer that tracks the heat reference delivered by the upper layer, and a lower layer that handles the interface between the control signal and the actual hardware (e.g., valves). Unlike most MPC studies for energy flexibility relied on electricity price as the utility signal and thus incorporated either energy consumption or energy cost into the objective function. However, a few papers investigated the use of performance metrics other than cost. For example, Knudsen and Petersen [22] used a weighted sum of electricity cost and carbon emissions as the objective function of an MPC. The weighting factor can be used to balance the performance of the MPC with respect to both indicators (i.e., cost and carbon emission). Péan et al. [23] tested an MPC with a co-simulation framework for a Spanish residential building. Carbon emission was considered in one of three objective functions. MPC has been proven by both simulation and field studies to be a suitable method for building energy management. However, one of the main bottlenecks of MPC lies in its need for reliable control models that can capture the dynamics of building and HVAC systems. Developing accurate control models for MPC is time consuming and problem specific. To address this problem, data-driven machine learning approaches such as reinforcement learning (RL) have gained increasing attention [26] in recent years. Although RL does not demonstrate a clear improvement over MPC, it compensates by requiring less a priori knowledge of the system, showcasing distinct advantages and trade-offs among different control approaches [24,25,27]. Table 1 summarizes the papers cited in our literature review. It is not our intent to provide a comprehensive list of relevant papers because several review papers [26,28\u201330] can be referred to. Table 1 leads to the following major observations, research gaps and questions: \u2022 Almost all previous studies use price-based demand flexibility for residential buildings. The control strategies react to time-varying electricity prices (e.g., time-of-use rates and real-time pricing) to save energy costs. The price-based demand-side management implicitly achieves load shedding and load shifting from peak hours, but the magnitude of sheaved or shifted power cannot be guaranteed. Explicit demand flexibility has been studied seldom in residential buildings, which could partially be attributed to the small potential of load management in single residential buildings. The increasing use of electric vehicles and the widespread integration of smart information and communication technology within households may gradually change this scenario over time. In this regard, the effectiveness of MPC in achieving explicit demand flexibility for residential buildings remains uncertain, and it is not clear how its performance varies across different flexibility events like load shedding, load shifting, and power tracking. \u2022 Most previous studies include air conditioning equipment (e.g., heat pumps) and thermal storage as the sources of demand flexibility. It is still rare that a single study covers multiple distributed energy resources (DERs). The extent to which a comprehensive set of DERs can provide demand flexibility remains uncertain. This research aims to assess demand flexibility in a residential setting incorporating multiple DERs. The originalities of this paper lie in the following aspects. First, in contrast to prior studies that primarily focused on limited thermostatic loads, such as space heating and air conditioning, this work addresses a research gap by considering a comprehensive array of DERs, including solar PV panels, stationary battery storage, an electric vehicle (EV), and an electric water heater with an associated storage tank for DHW. Second, in contrast to previous studies that focused on price-based demand flexibility, this work explores various facets of demand flexibility, including real-time pricing, demand limiting, load shedding, load shifting, and power tracking, within a common MPC framework. The MPC implementation considers occupant comfort and weather uncertainty to enhance the simulation's significance. Third, for load shedding and load shifting, an original approach is proposed in this paper to maximize the magnitude of sheaved power or shifted power. The findings of this paper are expected to offer valuable insights to policymakers, energy stakeholders, and researchers striving to achieve a cleaner and more sustainable society through grid-interactive buildings. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The modeling of different components, namely the building, the PV, the stationary battery, the DHW and the EV, is presented in Section 2. The five DF events are described in Section 3 with a focus on the metrics to evaluate the DF performance. The MPC formulations are presented in Section 4, and the simulation settings are provided in Section 5. Simulation results are presented and discussed in Section 6. This paper ends with some conclusions and an outlook for future work. 2 Component modeling Because of the trend of distributed power generation and electrification, a residential building is modeled in this work to include solar photovoltaic panels, a stationary battery, an electric water heater and an electric vehicle. 2.1 Building model To adequately represent and predict the dynamic response of the building using MPC, a third-order resistance-capacitance model, developed and evaluated by Frahm et al. [31], is deployed to describe the thermal dynamics of the building. The single-zone gray-box model uses three states: the indoor air temperature T air and the two states of the envelope temperature T w,in and T w,out . Each state is expressed as a first-order differential equation as follows: (1) C air d T air d t = T w,in − T air R w,air + T amb − T air R air,amb + f sol Φ global + f conv ( Φ HP + Φ internal ) (2) C w d T w,in d t = T air − T w,in R w,air + T w,out − T w,in R w + ( 1 − f conv ) ( Φ HP + Φ internal ) (3) C w d T w,out d t = T w,in − T w,out R w + T amb,eq − T w,out R w,amb . Where Φ HP , Φ global , and Φ internal , all in Watts, denote heat pump heating or cooling output, global solar radiation, and internal heat gains, respectively; f sol is an identifiable factor determining the impact of solar radiation on air temperature; f conv , set at 0.8, represents the convective fraction of heat pump output and internal heat gains; t is the time in seconds; C , R and T represent the heat capacity (J°C−1), thermal resistance (°C W−1), and temperature (°C), respectively; the subscripts w, air, in, out, and amb represent the building envelope, space air, the interior surface of the building envelope, the exterior surface of the building envelope, and ambient (outdoor) air, respectively. To model the heat exchange between the building envelope and the environment, the equivalent ambient temperature T amb,eq is calculated according to [32]: (4) T amb,eq = T amb + Φ global h f h A , where h f is the solar absorptance of the exterior surface of the building envelope ( h f = 0.5) and h A is the coefficient of heat transfer by long-wave radiation and convection at the exterior surface ( h A = 25 W m − 2 ° C − 1 ). The heat pump has its power consumption P t HP specified within a boundary Eq. (5) and the heating or cooling output is calculated from the coefficient of performance (COP) and P t HP (Eq. (6)). (5) P min HP ≤ P t HP ≤ P max HP (6) Φ HP = COP ⋅ P HP . The continuous model described by Eq. (1)-(3) is discretized with the sample time Δt, resulting in the following state-space model. (7) x t + 1 = A x t + B u t + E z t (8) y t + 1 = C x t + 1 , where x refers to the state variables ( T air , T w,in , T w,out ), u the controlled input ( P HP ), z the disturbances ( Φ global , T amb and Φ internal ), and y the model output ( T air ). To ensure thermal comfort, the space air temperature needs to be constrained within a predefined lower and upper bound of setpoint, expressed as follows: (9) T air low − ξ t ≤ T air ≤ T air high + ξ t The slack variable ξ t is introduced to soften the temperature constraints to prevent infeasible solutions. 2.2 PV The PV power generation P PV at time t is described according to [33,34]. (10) P t PV = n module ⋅ a module ⋅ η STC ⋅ η L & T ⋅ G t ⋅ ( 1 − ( η T ⋅ ( T t amb + N O C T − 20 800 ⋅ G t − 25 ) ) ) , where n module denotes the number of PV modules, a module the area of a single PV module (m2), η STC the electrical efficiency of the PV module at standard testing conditions, η L & T the combined efficiency of the inverter and the maximum power point tracking controller, G t the solar irradiation incident on the PV module at time t (W/m2), η T the temperature coefficient of PV power generation (°C−1), T t amb the ambient air temperature (°C), and N O C T the nominal operating cell temperature. All parameters are predefined constants, except for G t , which is calculated from weather parameters according to the method described in [35]. 2.3 Battery The stationary battery of the building is modeled as follows [16,36]: (11) E t B = E t-1 B + η ch B ⋅ Δ t ⋅ P t ch − P t d η d B ⋅ Δ t , where E t B represents the energy stored in the battery at time t; P t ch and P t d indicate the charging and discharging power at time t, respectively. η ch B and η d B indicate the battery charging and discharging efficiency, respectively. Based on E t B , the state of charge (SOC) of the battery is calculated as: (12) S O C t B = E t B E max B , with E max B being the maximum energy that can be stored in the battery. The following constraints apply to the stationary battery: (13) S O C min B ≤ S O C t B ≤ S O C max B (14) b t ch ⋅ P min ch ≤ P t ch ≤ b t ch ⋅ P max ch (15) b t d ⋅ P min d ≤ P t d ≤ b t d ⋅ P max d (16) 0 ≤ b t ch + b t d ≤ 1 In these constraints, b t ch and b t d are two binary variables utilized to indicate the charging and discharging status of the battery. These two binary variables are used in Eq. (16) to avoid simultaneous charging and discharging. 2.4 Domestic hot water The model of the DHW heater is retrieved from the work of Langner et al. [37] and is defined as follows: (17) T t tank = T t-1 tank + f r t-1 Δ t ( T in − T t-1 tank ) V tank + Δ t C tank ⋅ ( P t-1 DHW ⋅ η DHW − U tank A tank ( T t-1 tank − T t-1 air ) ) , where T tank , T in , and T air correspond to the temperatures (°C) of the tank water, inlet water, and the ambient air, respectively; f r t represents the hot water withdrawal (m3/s), V tank the tank volume (m3), C tank the heat capacity of the tank water (J°C−1), P DHW the power consumption of the water heater (W), η DHW the efficiency of converting electrical power into a heat flux, U tank the skin heat loss coefficient of the tank (W/m 2 °C), and A tank the tank's surface area (m2). The constraints of the hot water system specify the acceptable tank water temperature range and the water heater power not exceeding its capacity ( P max DHW ): (18) T min tank − ϵ t ≤ T t tank ≤ T max tank + ϵ t (19) 0 ≤ P t DHW ≤ P max DHW Similar to the use of ξ t for the space air temperature, the slack variable ϵ t is introduced to soften the DHW temperature constraint to prevent infeasible solutions. 2.5 EV model There are multiple approaches to adequately modeling the charging profile of an electric vehicle. The most common ones include Monte Carlo and Markov Chain for stochastics and machine learning approaches like artificial neural networks, generative adversarial networks or fuzzy logic [38\u201340]. A simple stochastic modeling approach is used in this work. The three variables of EV use patterns, including the departure time, the arrival time, and the driven distance, are all assumed to follow the normal distribution. Let μ arr , μ dep , and μ daily , respectively, denote the mean of arrival time, departure time, and daily driven distance, and σ arr , σ dep , and σ driven denote the standard deviation of the corresponding variables. Then, the EV variables are randomly generated on each day based on the following equations: (20) t dep = Z ⋅ σ dep + μ dep (21) t arr = Z ⋅ σ arr + μ arr (22) s daily = Z ⋅ σ driven + μ daily , where Z is random number with mean value of 0 and standard deviation of 1. Based on the state-of-the-art home charging stations on the market [41], a 3-level discrete charging is used for the EV. Thus, the charging power at each time step is determined in the following: (23) P t EV = { P plug ⋅ level ev , if t < t dep | | t > t arr 0 , otherwise (24) 0 ≤ ∑ i = 1 3 level ev [ i ] ≤ 1 , with level ev [ i ] = { 0 , 1 } (25) S O C min EV ≤ S O C t EV ≤ S O C max EV (26) λ dep = S O C max EV − S O C t dep EV , with t as the current simulation time of day, P plug as the power levels of the EV charger and S O C t EV as the state of charge of the EV battery; level ev is a 3x1 vector of binaries where only one can be true at a time (Eq. (24)). This variable ensures only one charging level of the EV home charging station is allowed per time step. Eq. (23) condition ensures charging is only possible when the EV is at home (i.e. between the arrival and the departure time). Eq. (26) introduces the slack variable λ dep , defined as the deviation of the S O C t EV at its departure time from the maximum S O C max EV . Therefore, it ensures the EV is fully charged at t = t dep . The battery energy of the EV is calculated as: (27) E t EV = { E t-1 EV − ρ ev s daily , if t = t dep E t-1 EV + η ch EV P t EV Δ t , otherwise where E t EV , P t EV , and η ch EV represent the charged energy, the charging power, and the charging efficiency, respectively; ρ ev is the average electricity consumption per km, and s daily is the traveled distance for that day. For simplification, the entire distance is driven within one time step immediately after the EV departure. This simplification has no impact on the optimization results of the MPC. 3 Demand flexibility events The work of Zhang et al. [42] has been closely followed in this paper to consider five types of DF events, including real-time pricing, demand limiting, load shedding, load shifting and load tracking. These events, as well as the method to quantify the flexibility for each event, are presented in this section. 3.1 Real-time pricing For real-time pricing (RTP), the price signal Ω t RTP is modeled based on the wholesale electricity market. The price profile represents the dynamic change of electric demand and supply over different periods of the day, reflecting the actual cost of power production. Data from the German electricity market [43] is used as the base but scaled up to derive the RTP profile. The purpose of scaling is to have the arithmetic mean value of the RTP profile equal to the current flat rate price Ω t FRP of 36.06 ¢/kW h. The orange line in Fig. 1 displays the derived RTP profile for one week. The performance of demand flexibility in response to RTP is defined as the percentage of electricity cost savings: (28) D F RTP = κ base FRP − κ RTP κ base FRP ⋅ 100 % , where κ base FRP and κ RTP are the total operating energy cost for the baseline (with flat-rate pricing) and real-time pricing, respectively. 3.2 Demand limiting The demand-limiting event limits the power demand of the building from the grid during a predefined period between start time t s and end time t f . The performance of DF for demand limiting is evaluated by the percentage of time when the actual power falls below the demand limit [42]: (29) D F dl = ∫ t s t f t ( P t grid ≤ P dl ) ∫ t s t f t ⋅ 100 % , where P t grid is the power taken from the grid and P dl is the defined demand limit. 3.3 Load shedding The load-shedding event requires that the power demand be reduced by P dec relative to the baseline power ( P t base ) of the building's usual operation during a predefined period between the start time t s and the end time t f . The performance of demand flexibility for load shedding is evaluated by the percentage of time when the desired demand reduction is achieved during the event. (30) D F ls = ∫ t s t f t ( P t grid ≤ P t base − P dec ) ∫ t s t f t ⋅ 100 % 3.4 Load shifting The load-shifting event intends to shift load from a peak to a non-peak period. It can be considered a load-shedding event plus a load-increasing event, either beforehand or afterwards. Similar to the load-shedding event, the load-increasing event requires the power demand to be increased by P inc relative to the building's baseline operation during a predefined period between the start time t s and the end time t f . The performance of DF for load increase is evaluated by the percentage of time when the desired demand increase is achieved during the load increase period: (31) D F inc = ∫ t s t f t ( P t grid ≥ P t base + P inc ) ∫ t s t f t ⋅ 100 % The overall performance of demand flexibility for the entire load shifting event is simply the average of results from Eq. (30) and Eq. (31). 3.5 Power tracking The power-tracking event requires the building to follow a predefined reference power profile. The RTP profile introduced earlier in Section 3.1 is used as the basis to derive the reference power profile. Because the real-time prices reflect the underlying wholesale electricity market supply and demand, the reference power profile is modeled to have a reverse direction of the real-time prices, as shown in Eq. (32). In this equation, an additional scaling factor k ref is applied to match the magnitude of power consumption, and its value is empirically determined to be 8000 kW2 h/ Image 1 for this study. (32) P t ref = ( max ( Q RTP ) − Q t RTP ) ⋅ k ref After the power signals are generated for all time steps, a smoothing method based on Gaussian-weighted moving average is applied to smooth out the reference power profile. The blue line in Fig. 1 shows the derived reference power profile and its comparison with the RTP profile. Unlike demand limiting, load shedding and shifting, which are flexibility events for a few hours, the load tracking event applies for a whole day. The performance of the DF for power tracking is defined as the percentage of time when the power does not deviate from the reference outside the error band P δ [42]: (33) D F pt = ∫ t ( | P t grid − P t ref | ≤ P δ ) ∫ t ⋅ 100 % 4 Model predictive control In this study, we adopt an MPC optimization approach for the following reasons. Firstly, the training process for reinforcement learning demands a significant amount of data that we are short of. Secondly, MPC has demonstrated its efficiency in optimizing thermal building systems and has undergone extensive testing across various applications. Lastly, the successful utilization of MPC in our prior research [31,37] enables us to draw upon the developed component models and established knowledge in this work. 4.1 Formulations Let N denote the prediction horizon, and Δt the length of the time step. For each time step, the MPC calculates the optimal solution over the entire prediction horizon. At each time step, the power supply must balance the power demand. The power supply includes power generated from the PV ( P t P V ), purchased from the grid ( P t grid ), and discharged from the battery ( P t d ). The power demand comes from the heat pump ( P t HP ), battery charging ( P t ch ), domestic hot water heater ( P t DHW ), and EV charging ( P t EV ). The power balance equation is expressed as: (34) P t grid + P t P V + P t d = P t HP + P t ch + P t DHW + P t EV The power P t grid taken from the grid needs to be below a specific limit constrained by the wiring capacity: (35) 0 ≤ P t grid ≤ P max grid Equations (34) and (35) apply for all cases investigated in this study. However, additional constraints may be needed for some cases and they are described together with the objective functions in the rest of the subsection. 4.1.1 Baseline, RTP, demand limiting For the cases of baseline, real-time pricing, and demand limiting, the MPC aims to minimize the energy cost. The slack variables used in soft constraints are included in the objective function as penalty items. Thus, the objective function is formulated as: (36) min ( ∑ t = 1 T P t grid Ω t k Δ t + β ⋅ ( \u2016 ξ t \u2016 2 + \u2016 ϵ t \u2016 2 + \u2016 λ dep \u2016 2 ) ) , where Ω t k is the price signal at time t, which is either Ω t FRP or Ω t RTP for the RTP scenario (see Sec. 3.1); ξ t is the indoor temperature violation at time t and ϵ t is the DHW temperature violation at time t; λ dep is the deviation of the S O C t EV at the EV departure time from the maximum S O C max EV ; β is a large positive weighting factor to penalize the soft constraint violations of the slack variables. In the case of demand limiting, the power purchased from the grid is constrained during the power limit event period: (37) 0 ≤ P t grid ≤ P dl . Different methods can be used to determine the demand limit ( P dl ). For example, a simple approach is to predefine a fixed power limit based on the building's historical power profile and the system and equipment operating characteristics. The demand limit can also be considered as a dynamic optimization variable within the MPC framework. We opt for the former approach when implementing demand limiting, with the latter approach being illustrated in the context of load-shedding and load-shifting, as discussed next. 4.1.2 Load shedding and shifting For the cases of load shedding and load shifting, an additional term, τ t , is introduced in the objective function to maximize the amount of power reduction in the demand shedding period or power-increase in the load-increasing period. Thus, the objective function is formulated as: (38) min ( ∑ t = 1 T P t grid Ω t k Δ t + β ⋅ ( \u2016 ξ t \u2016 2 + \u2016 ϵ t \u2016 2 + \u2016 λ dep \u2016 2 ) − τ t ) The rationale of using τ t is to address the limitation of using static values of power decrease ( P dec ) and power increase ( P inc ) relative to the baseline. It is not trivial to determine appropriate values for P dec and P inc . If too aggressive targets are defined (i.e., P dec and P inc are unreasonably high), they cannot be achievable, and the customer may receive penalties from the utility. On the other hand, if P dec and P inc are defined too low, the targets are conservative, and potential opportunities for demand shifting are missed. Through τ t , the power flexibility can be maximized by reducing the power demand beyond P dec and increasing the power demand beyond P inc , if possible. For load shedding, the constraints related to τ t are formulated as follows: (39) 0 ≤ P t grid ≤ P t base − τ t (40) P t base ≥ τ t ≥ { P dec , if P t base ≥ P dec 0 , otherwise , where P dec is the minimum amount of power to be shaved if P t base is greater than P dec . The parameter value of P dec needs to be predefined based on the minimum requirement by the utility and the historical power profile of the building. The second condition of Eq. (40) ensures that P t grid cannot be negative to avoid numerical infeasibility. Note that τ t is maximized for each time step to achieve the largest possible load shedding. For load shifting, additional constraints related to τ t need to be formulated for the power-increasing period as follows: (41) P t base + τ t ≤ P t grid ≤ P max grid (42) P inc ≤ τ t , with P inc as the minimum amount of power to be incremented from the baseline power. 4.1.3 Power tracking For the case of power tracking, the goal is not to minimize the energy bill but to track the reference signal as closely as possible while maintaining the applicable constraints. The objective function is therefore formulated as: (43) min ( ∑ t = 1 T \u2016 δ t \u2016 2 Δ t + β ⋅ ( \u2016 ξ t \u2016 2 + \u2016 ϵ t \u2016 2 + \u2016 λ dep \u2016 2 ) ) In Eq. (43), δ t is a slack variable indicating the deviation from the reference power profile exceeding the acceptable limit ( P δ ) at time t. With the use of δ t , the deviation from the reference power profile is then formulated as the following constraint: (44) | P t grid − P t ref | ≤ P δ + δ t 4.2 Performance metrics definitions We introduce the following key performance indicator (KPI)s to assess the performance of MPC. \u2022 The total operating energy cost (κ) in Euros. This KPI is considered in the objective function of all MPC formulations, except for the case of load tracking. \u2022 The total number of time steps ( n tv ) when the thermal comfort requirement is violated. Due to the soft constraints on maintaining thermal comfort (see Eq. (9)), the air temperature might exceed the predefined boundaries. To quantify this, a small threshold value (e.g., 0.05°C) is utilized to define comfort violation. We introduce this threshold to avoid counting the negligible violations due to the nature of numerical solvers and the use of soft constraint space air temperature. Additionally, a temperature deviation of less than 0.05°C is not noticeable and therefore has no effect on actual user comfort. A time step is counted towards n tv if the space temperature deviates from the comfort zone by more than 0.05°C. \u2022 The average degree of thermal comfort violation ( δ dc in °C). This KPI is calculated as the average of temperature deviations from the comfort zone during the time steps covered by n tv : (45) δ dc = ∑ ( ξ t ) n tv \u2022 Metrics to evaluate the performance of demand flexibility (see Sec. 3), including D F dl for demand limiting, D F ls for load shedding, D F ls combined with D F inc for load shifting, and D F pt for power tracking. \u2022 Additionally, the average shaved power D ps [44] describes the demand decrease relative to the baseline total load. The average shaved power is calculated for the power shaving period only: (46) D ps = ∫ t s t f Average demand decrease Average baseline demand ⋅ 100 % \u2022 The relative daily peak increases p d . The daily maxima of each DF scenario are compared to the peaks of the baseline on the respective day [45]. (47) p d = Daily peaks DF event Daily peaks baseline 5 Simulation environment 5.1 Weather data The building is located in Karlsruhe, Germany, where winter is the most challenging season for electrical supply. Therefore, by examining the site's historical weather data from the German Meteorological Service (DWD) [46], we selected one winter week in 2020 with dominant cold weather for analysis. The forecasted data are obtained from ECMWF [47]. Fig. 2 displays the temperature and solar radiation profiles over time and compares them to the forecast. The selected days have a measured mean temperature of 1.56°C and a measured mean solar radiation of 20.11 W m−2. Furthermore, the range of outdoor temperatures is from −5°C to 10°C, and the solar radiation is low (less than 250 W m−2), as is typical for German winter. Statistically, the forecasts have a mean squared error (MSE) of 3.79°C for air temperature and an MSE of 2719.5 W m−2 for solar radiation. The discrepancies between forecasts and measurements potentially challenge the MPC to achieve optimal controls while satisfying comfort requirements. 5.2 Parameter settings In this work, one time step Δt is 15 minutes, and the prediction horizon of the MPC equals 16 hours. A simple occupancy schedule is used to represent three occupancy statuses: away from home, active at home, and asleep at home. The value of T air low is set at 20.5°C when the residents are active at home (i.e., from 6:00 to 8:00 and 17:00 to 23:00) and at 17.5°C when the occupants are asleep (between 23:00 and 6:00) or away from home (between 8:00 and 17:00) while the value of T air high is set at 23°C when the residents are at home and 27°C otherwise. The internal heat gains are assumed to be 185 W per occupant when the residents are active at home and 100 W per occupant when the residents are asleep. Table 2 lists the parameters for the heat pump, PV, battery storage, domestic hot water, and EV. Except for EV, all parameter values are taken from the previous work [37]. For EV modeling, the average daily driving distance μ daily of 36.5 km is obtained from the German motor vehicle department (Kraftfahr-Bundesamt KBA [48]). The associated standard deviation σ driven , set at 15 km, is based on common practice and the authors' judgment. This standard deviation accounts for driving uncertainties such as working at home, additional shopping trips, meetings with friends, and unplanned detours. The average consumption ρ ev and the total battery size E max EV of the EV are based on the typical values of EVs on the market [49]. The means and standard deviations of departure and arrival time are based on [50,51]. Table 3 states the parameters for all the DF events, including the increasing and the shedding periods. The power tracking parameters P δ and k ref are empirically determined. 5.3 Implementation The optimization problem is a mixed-integer linear programming problem. It is implemented in MATLAB 2023a with the help of the YALMIP toolbox [52] and solved with Gurobi 10.0.2 [53]. The optimizer solves the objective function for the optimal inputs at each time step over the entire prediction horizon. Based on a computer with 32 GB RAM and an Intel Core i7-10700 (2.9 GHz) processor, the simulation of one time step Δt of 15 min takes between 4 and 20 seconds to compute, which is noticeably fast. 6 Results and discussion 6.1 Baseline The base case has a flat rate electricity price, deploys MPC for cost optimization and does not consider demand flexibility in the optimization. The baseline results, displayed in Fig. 3 , are used as the reference to illustrate the potential demand flexibility of the building in the following subsections. Fig. 3 comprises two subplots. The upper plot shows the profiles of the space temperature, the bounds of the acceptable temperature range, and the power purchased from the grid while the lower plot shows the profiles of PV power generation, the end-use power for heat pump, DHW, and EV, and the SOC of both the stationary battery and the EV battery. The space temperature remains close to or at the lower boundary during the occupied hours when the residents are at home to minimize heating energy consumption and thereby the objective function of energy bills. During the unoccupied hours, the space cools down for about 2°C. Nonetheless, the temperature is still above the lower bound of 17.5°C, which does not trigger the heat pump (HP) to heat most of the time during the unoccupied hours. However, the heat pump is on for several time steps near the end of the unoccupied hours to warm up the space gradually towards the increased temperature setpoint before the residents return home. Similar observations are made for the time steps right before the change of occupant status from asleep to active in the early morning. These observations demonstrate the advantage of the MPC as heating starts before the setpoint increases to satisfy thermal comfort. As shown in the lower part of Fig. 3, the PV power (negative for generation) is much smaller than the power demand. The solar power is used directly by either the DHW heater or the HP throughout the entire simulation period, except for several time steps on the second day, when the solar power is higher than the sum of the electric loads considered in this work. The surplus power is sent to the battery storage. Other than the time steps mentioned above, the battery storage is not used at all. The inactive use of battery is reasonable because the baseline MPC does not specify any constraints preferring power purchase from the grid at one time step to another time step and battery charging or discharging does not contribute to minimizing the objective function. Fig. 3 shows that daily power purchased from the grid ( P grid in the upper plot) is typically high between 16:00 and 19:00 due to the simultaneous use of the heat pump and EV charger. The peak power during the peak-period (16:00 to 19:00) is 4691 W, 4385 W, 4692 W, 4050 W and 2900 W, respectively for the five days. For the entire simulation period, the total energy consumption is 152.7 kW h, the total energy cost is 55.1 Image 1 , and thermal comfort is fully satisfied (Table 4 ). 6.2 Demand flexibility results 6.2.1 Real-time pricing Fig. 4 shows the results for the case of real-time pricing. The time of operating the heat pump is no longer driven merely by the space temperature. The dynamic electricity rate profile triggers the need to run the HP in many time steps (e.g., 12:00 to 16:00 on first day) when the electricity rate is low but the space temperature is still higher than its lower setpoint. Because of the heat pump operation, the space temperature even reaches close to its upper setpoint at 7:00 on the second day. In general, there is a correlation between the electricity price and the power purchased from the grid - high power demands occur when the electricity price is low. In comparison with the baseline, the stationary battery is actively used for charging at time steps with low electricity prices and for discharging when the electricity price and the load are high. Except for the first day for which the initial SOC of the EV battery is very low (50%), the EV is charged to the desired level (i.e. 90%) at the departure time for all days. The DHW heater profile ( P DHW ) has a higher amplitude than that of the baseline, which indicates that the DHW is heated above the setpoint as needed at time steps with low electricity price. The quantified results of RTP from Fig. 4, Table 4, and Table 5 lead to the following major observations: \u2022 Even though peak shaving is not explicitly considered in the MPC, peak power during the peak period (16:00 to 19:00) has reduced from the baseline to 2315 W, 1891 W, 1137 W, 345 W and 2500 W for the five days, respectively. The average demand during the peak periods has decreased by 92%. This indicates the positive correlation between peak periods and high electricity prices. \u2022 Applying RTP has caused a minor increase in the purchased energy consumption from 152.7 W for the baseline to 159 W. However, the overall cost is reduced by 28%, from 55.1 Image 1 to 39.9 Image 1 (Table 4). This demonstrates that RTP may yield monetary benefits to residential households when employing advanced controls such as MPC. \u2022 The daily peak demand increases significantly from the baseline, leading to the relative daily peak between 1.73 and 2.12 (Table 5). Consequently, the MPC formulation in this paper indicates the generation of new peaks outside of the peak periods. \u2022 The MPC has satisfied the constraint of thermal comfort well with no violations. 6.2.2 Demand limiting For the case of demand limiting, the power purchased from the grid is limited by P dl = 800 W between 16:00 and 19:00. This demand limit is fully satisfied during the event periods (pink area in Fig. 5 ), leading to the defined D F dl being 100% (see Table 4). Because of the flat electricity rate, the HP is operated as needed to satisfy thermal comfort, and the space temperature profile is similar to that of the baseline. The stationary battery is charged ahead before the demand-limiting event starts, using the generated PV power and additional power from the grid as needed. During the demand-limiting time periods, the heat pump can still be operated to satisfy thermal comfort but the battery is discharged to reduce the amount of power purchased from the grid. Relative to the baseline, EV charging is postponed after the event period, but the target level of EV charging is still reached at departure time every morning, except for the first day. In addition, whenever the DHW heater needs to be on around the demand limiting time windows, it starts earlier with higher power demands than the baseline to avoid the simultaneous operation of both the heat pump and the DHW heater. Relative to the baseline, which has its maximum power during the demand limiting windows in the ranges between 2900 W for the last day and 4692 W for the third day, the peak power during the same time windows is reduced to 800 W after successfully applying the demand limit. The average power deduction is around 69% during the event window (Table 4). Applying the demand limit may cause new daily peak power outside the demand limiting windows, and the relative daily peak increase varies with different days. For example, the relative daily peak increase is from 3% on the second day to 63% on the last day (see Table 5). These power shifts result from the previously mentioned preheating of space air and DHW before an event period. The first day is excluded because the peak induced by EV charging in the morning matches the baseline and, therefore, is not influenced by the demand-limiting event. Just like in the baseline scenario, there are no comfort violations. The total electricity consumption is slightly higher than the baseline, mainly due to the efficiency loss of battery charging and discharging. 6.2.3 Load shedding Fig. 6 displays the results for load shedding. It can be observed that no power is purchased from the grid during the shedding period for all days, which leads to a maximum peak shaving D ps of 100% and D F ls of 100% (Table 4). Relative to the baseline, the power is shaved by more than P dec (500 W) most of the time during the event periods, demonstrating the significance of power reduction maximization discussed in Section 4.1.2. Similar to demand limiting, load shedding is realized by 1) charging the battery before the event and using the charged battery to satisfy the loads during the event, 2) shifting EV charging to the post-event period, and 3) shifting the operation of the HP and the DHW heater ahead of the event to preheat the space and domestic hot water. The combination of battery charging and preheating induces power spikes, observable in the middle plot of Fig. 6, briefly before the event starts. The relative daily peak increases p d ranges from around 20% to 161% (Table 5). Note that new peaks occur before demand shedding, in contrast to the literature's reported rebound afterwards. That is because the thermostat setpoints are not changed, and the MPC relies on preheating to provide the demand flexibility. Due to losses in energy conversion, said power shifts are also reflected in the total energy costs compared to the baseline scenario. Let's move this to the conclusion part. Due to losses in energy conversion, said power shifts are also reflected in the total energy costs compared to the baseline scenario. We see an increase of 1.8%. Economic incentives might be necessary to make this approach viable and attractive for customers in a real-world application. 6.2.4 Load shifting Fig. 7 shows the results for load shifting. Because the observations made for load shedding apply to the shedding period of this case, the discussion will focus on the load-increasing period. Relative to the baseline, where the peak power during the load-increasing period ranges from 1388 W to 4374 W, the case of load shifting has increased the peak power during said time by about 71%, to around 7500 W for multiple time steps. For one time step of the first day, the power reaches a maximum of 9490 W when EV charging, indoor air heating and battery charging are combined. Recall that load increase is included in the optimization (Section 4.1.2). Therefore, the increased power exceeds the predefined P inc of 500 W during the load-increasing period, and the sheaved power exceeds the predefined P dec of 500 W during the load shedding period, leading to D F ls = 100% and D F inc = 100% (Table 4). Table 5 shows that the relative daily peak changes of load shedding and shifting are comparable for 3 out of 5 days. The major difference lies in the duration of peak power. In the shedding scenario, the peak occurs for only a few time steps, while in the load-shifting case, the peak power is held at a noticeable portion of the increasing period. The above difference is attributed to including the load increase in the objective function for load shifting. Consequently, the continuous power increase leads to 9.6% additional costs compared to the baseline, making this demand flexibility approach the most expensive on the customer side. Because of that, higher monetary compensation is needed to implement demand shifting than all other DF events. The power shifted to the load increase period is used to charge the battery and run the DHW heater (both lower plot) and the heat pump (upper plot). Consequently, this leads to a noticeable increase in indoor air temperature before the occupied period begins. In Fig. 7, these induced peaks are presented for each day in the upper plot. Because of that, the required heating power during the shedding period decreases even further. Therefore, unlike during the load shedding event presented in Section 6.2.3, the stored power in the stationary battery is available for EV charging during the shedding time peak periods every day. The last day is an exception because the EV does not return until after 19:00. Nonetheless, that is only possible if the battery has sufficient charged energy. 6.2.5 Power tracking The last regarded flexibility event is power tracking, displayed in Fig. 8 . Because the goal is to follow the reference power as closely as possible, P ref and the allowed deviation P δ are shown in the middle plot. Because the initial SOC of the EV battery is at 50%, extensive EV charging is needed and thus causes the problem of tracking the reference power before 8:00 on the first day. In contrast to the above block of time, the reference power is followed well for most times, especially on the third and fourth days. Due to the simultaneous power demand by the heat pump and EV charging, there exist several time steps (e.g., from 00:00 to 6:00 on the second day) when the purchased power is higher than the reference power even after accounting for the acceptable deviation. The reference profile consistently remains below the peaks observed in the baseline, as indicated by the relative daily peak ranging from 0.41 to 1.0 (Table 5). Among all five investigated DF events, power tracking is the only case that does not generate new daily peak values. Dealing with the initial charging of the EV and managing the spikes in power demand is challenging in designing the reference profile, particularly in defining an adequate scaling factor. Initially, the system requires more power due to EV charging and building heating. Additionally, battery usage and thermal storage only become available as the simulation progresses. This results in either insufficient energy for the first day or a constant surplus for the following days. We opted for the first option because the main goal is to perform adequately in stationary operation, represented more suitably by the latter days. Overall, the building tracks the provided signal effectively 70% of the time while keeping the energy cost nearly the same as that for the baseline (see Table 4). 6.3 Applying additional demand flexibility to real-time pricing Generally, the time with high real-time pricing coincides with the time period for other demand flexibility events such as demand limiting and demand shedding. Optimizing the energy cost for RTP will indirectly shave the peak demand during the event period. This can be demonstrated by the RTP case discussed in Section 6.2.1, which shaved the maximum peak demand during the peak period (16:00 to 19:00) from 4692 W in the baseline to 2500 W. Noticing that MPC performed so well in load shedding and shifting under a flat rate structure, we are interested to know the additional benefits of applying demand flexibility on top of RTP. Therefore, two new cases are simulated in this subsection. One case has RTP and load shedding and the other case has RTP and load shifting. Their results are compared with the RTP case (Table 6 ). \u2022 The load-shedding scenario has completely eliminated the power use during the shedding time windows and thus has a D ps of 100%. However, because the RTP case has only a total of five time steps (i.e. 75 min) with power demand, applying load shedding has negligible impact on the energy cost (see Table 6). \u2022 Applying load shifting to the RTP case not only eliminates the power use during the shedding time windows but also successfully increases the power use beyond P inc during the load-increasing time windows ( D F inc = 100 % ). Because the MPC optimization includes the tradeoff between energy cost and the magnitude of power increase, applying load shifting has increased energy cost by 17.5% from 40 to 47 Image 1 . Overall, applying DF events to the RTP scenario yields two crucial findings. First, it underscores the alignment of event windows with peak-price periods, thus validating our timing choices and the significance of employing peak shaving during these time windows. Second, while the impact may be modest in this context, these events enhance power savings during peak periods. Therefore, emphasizing the system's optimization, particularly over the long term, where even marginal improvements can exert a more substantial influence. 7 Conclusions and outlook This paper investigated the potential of using MPC for demand flexibility in a residential building, equipped with a comprehensive array of DERs, including solar PV panels, stationary battery storage, an EV, a heat pump for space heating and cooling, passive thermal storage, and an electric water heater with associated tank for DHW. A multi-criteria optimization algorithm was implemented to minimize energy cost while satisfying the desired demand flexibility, the space temperature requirement towards thermal comfort, and the operational criteria of considered component models. Major conclusions include the following: \u2022 The simulation study demonstrated the capability and effectiveness of MPC to realize demand flexibility through real-time pricing, demand limiting, load shedding and shifting, and power tracking. For a residential building in Karlsruhe, Germany, the peak power during the peak periods of five winter days was reduced by 92%, 69%, 100%, and 100% for RTP, demand limiting, load shedding and shifting, respectively. For the power tracking scenario, the MPC successfully tracked the reference power profile for 70% of the simulation time. \u2022 Achieving demand flexibility does not necessarily mean an increase in energy cost. For example, the energy cost for the RTP scenario decreased by 28% from the baseline. However, a slight increase in energy cost was observed for the other four cases, of which the case of load shifting had the maximum cost increase of 10% from the baseline. That provides an idea of the minimum financial incentive needed, which varies with the DF events, to compensate customers for their participation. \u2022 Except for power tracking, the remaining four DF events caused new daily peaks. Across all five days, the daily peak registered an average increase of 18%, 70%, 83%, and 91% for demand limiting, load shedding, load shifting, and real-time pricing, respectively. Therefore, applying the same MPC to a substantial number of buildings without coordination may pose challenges associated with the new daily peak. In contrast to the conventional demand response strategy that resets thermostat temperature setpoints during peak periods that may sacrifice thermal comfort and cause power rebound after the shedding period, the MPC relied on space preheating to provide the demand flexibility without sacrificing thermal comfort, and, therefore, the new peak occurred before the demand shedding time window. \u2022 Demand shedding and shifting could be combined with real-time pricing, but the incremental impact of shaving the peak demand during the shedding time windows was limited. \u2022 The study deems the demand-limiting approach to be promising regarding its simplicity. It requires little knowledge about the system and stands out through straightforward implementation. On the other hand, load shedding showed 100% peak shavings with only a minor increase in operational costs and some additional implementational effort. Therefore, load shedding was the most promising approach overall. \u2022 The MPC fully satisfied the requirements for space heating, domestic hot water, and electric vehicle charging for all cases confronted with weather forecasting uncertainty. That indicates the effectiveness of MPC for building power management as long as reliable models exist to capture the dynamics of the building and its systems. This work could be improved in future in several directions. First, this paper considered the uncertainty of weather forecasts only. Because the uncertainties of other sources, such as real-time pricing, occupant behavior and building modeling, are also influential factors in determining the MPC performance, they thus need to be investigated. Second, potential financial incentives for providing demand flexibility and carbon emissions could be considered in the MPC formulation in the future. Furthermore, the battery model could be enhanced by considering battery life degradation due to charging and discharging cycles. For the EV, implementing a bidirectional charger would allow the discharging of the EV battery, enabling the power supply to the building and the grid and creating more demand flexibility opportunities.

        "dc:description": "One of the major challenges with increasing penetration of renewable energy sources (e.g., solar and wind) is to maintain grid stability. Grid-interactive efficient buildings are regarded as a promising approach to advance the role buildings can play in energy system operations and planning. This paper evaluates the demand flexibility in a residential building located in Karlsruhe, Germany, incorporating multiple distributed energy resources, including a photovoltaic and battery system, an electric vehicle, an electric water heater and a heat pump. A multi-criteria optimization problem is formulated with model predictive control (MPC) for five cases of demand flexibility. The simulation results of five winter days show that the peak power during the peak periods can be reduced by 92%, 69%, 100%, and 100% for real-time pricing, demand limiting, load shedding, and load shifting, respectively. For the power tracking scenario, the MPC tracked the reference power profile successfully for 70% of the simulation time. Achieving demand flexibility does not necessarily cause an increase in energy costs.",
