Variable refrigerant flow (VRF) air-conditioning systems have seen significant growth in Asia and its application is expanding globally. Despite the expanded application, most previous studies have focused on developing fault detection and diagnostics to achieve energy-efficient operations than on predicting power consumption. It's very difficult to predict the electrical consumption owing to its complex system configuration and various control strategies. A new control strategy is described for optimal adjustment of the desired target level based on time series forecasting using the optimized sequence to sequence model for VRF systems. Sequence to sequence (seq2seq) model with attention mechanism and Bayesian optimization is developed to predict accurate hourly and daily forecasts and rapid feedback control for fluctuating power consumption for VRF systems. The optimized seq2seq model is integrated into the intelligent load control (ILC). ILC can be used to manage VRF systems by dynamically prioritizing indoor units for curtailment using both quantitative inputs and qualitative rules. Overall, the results demonstrate that the deep learning based control allows coordination of the controllable loads of VRF systems in three commercial buildings. ILC with deep learning manages the power consumption within a desired target level, as well as indoor temperature reflecting the status of controlled indoor units, as objective functions of the control algorithm.

Especially, the energy used for building operations mostly depends on fossil fuels, which result in the emission of a significant amount of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide [2]. Approximately 40 % of global energy consumption occurs in the building sector, which also accounts for about 30\u201340 % of global greenhouse gas emissions [3], driven by heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), lighting, and other electrical devices [4]. Among them, HVAC systems play a major role in overall energy consumption, using 50\u201360 % of the energy in buildings [5]. The use of variable refrigerant flow (VRF) system is common in Asia and has recently started to make in-roads within the U.S. market for commercial and residential air conditioners due to small space requirement, high part-load efficiency and individual thermal control strategy. VRF system is considered one of the most energy efficient and environmentally friendly systems to regulate the capacity using variable speed compressors in the outdoor unit and electronic expansion value located in each indoor unit [6]. VRF also reduces greenhouse gas emissions compared with other HVAC systems. Emissions impacts vary in the same proportion to the utility cost savings. These increase significantly as more renewable energy is added to the grid [7]. In various case studies [8], VRF systems have demonstrated the energy savings potential by comparing other traditional HVAC systems, model simulations, and field performance test. Aynur et al. [9] evaluated the performance of traditional air conditioning and VRF system using EnergyPlus simulation. The VRF system demonstrated energy savings of 27\u201357 % compared to the traditional HVAC system. The other study [10] also explored the energy-saving potential of VRF system compared to conventional HVAC systems across various U.S. climates using EnergyPlus simulation. Their study showed that the VRF system could achieve energy savings of 15\u201342 % compared to standard rooftop units (RTUs) and lower operating cost except in cold climates. Another study [11] demonstrated that applying a VRF system could reduce energy consumption by 44 % compared to the chiller with boiler in commercial building. VRF systems are recognized as a key technology for improving energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. For these reason, VRF systems are being developed as one of the most energy-efficient equipment for reducing electricity consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. The traditional HVAC system, the dominant type in the past, is now gradually being replaced by the VRF system. As a result, the VRF systems industry is projected to annual market growth of 11 % in the Asia region [12] and share 24 % of the global commercial air conditioning market [13]. Despite the expanded application of VRF system, previous studies [14,15] have mostly focused on developing deep learning (DL) based fault detection and diagnostic (FDD) methods. In general, VRF system has different types of faults, such as the refrigerant overcharge or undercharge [16], airside fouling [17], expansion valve stuck [18], temperature sensor detached or bias [19], and liquid floodback [20]. Several studies [21,22] diagnosed VRF refrigerant charging fault using principal component analysis based exponentially weighted moving average and Bayesian artificial neural networks (ANN), respectively. The similar study [16] proposed back propagation neural networks (BPNN) and decision tree (DT) to detect refrigerant charge fault in VRF systems. The other study [23] proposed a robust FDD strategy for VRF systems using an ensemble Bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM). Another study [24] implemented FDD for VRF systems using virtual sensor sand sequence to sequence (seq2seq) models. The evaluation based on the performance degradations (power consumption or energy efficiency) is useful information for diagnosing the severity of faults before deciding if service is needed. Therefore, it is necessary to require accurate load forecast of VRF for the FDD outputs. Therefore, the advancement of DL techniques made in other domains also have a significant potential in VRF load forecasting. Currently, statistical models are widely used for load forecasting of VRFs based on the data provided by product specifications. One study [25] presents a statistical model to simulate the energy performance of VRF systems in the EnergyPlus. The model has been verified using experimental data and is designed to more accurately assess the energy efficiency of VRF systems. The other study [26] developed a dynamic model for VRF system, which was validated to capture the dynamic characteristics of the system with high accuracy. Another study [27] developed a VRF model based on measured data. Results show that increasing the part-load ratio of the VRF system enhances the performance of outdoor units and lowers energy consumption for space conditioning. These models are generally reliable if the relationship between dependent variables (load of VRFs) and independent variables (outdoor temperature, hour-of-day, etc.) is linear. However, if the relationship between the dependent and independent variables is complex and/or non-linear, traditional modeling approaches usually have high uncertainty. DL techniques are better at handling complex and non-linear relationships. One study [28] proposed a performance estimation model using ML and limited experimental data to predict VRF power consumption, achieving accuracy with a root mean squared error (RMSE) below 0.2. The other studies [29,30] developed ANN model to predict hourly energy consumption for VRF heating system, achieving 4.9 % and 7.4 % CvRMSE, respectively. Another study [31] developed LSTM based seq2seq model for electricity load forecasting of VRF systems. Through feature selection and Bayesian hyperparameter optimization, DL model enhances the accuracy of multi-step electricity consumption prediction in commercial buildings. However, existing model typically applied to real-world electricity consumption of VRF for an hour ahead load forecasting. While hourly models offer detailed predictions of energy consumption, the daily models are also making it easier to identify overall trends and patterns in energy usage. This is particularly useful for long-term planning, energy management strategies. In this paper, we proposed both daily and hourly load forecasting models based on a seq2seq with attention mechanism. The daily load forecasting model allows for long-term planning to control target power consumption, while the hourly load forecasting model is used for the optimal adjustment of the desired target level in response to changing loads. The control functionality in VRF systems is an important factor that determine both efficiency and adaptability. By accurately adjusting control set-points for individual indoor units, VRF system can achieve energy savings and maintain comfortable indoor environments to each zone [32]. The one study [33] investigated the impact of occupant behavior on the energy performance of VRF systems in office buildings. They find that occupant-controlled factors, such as set-point, operating duration, and air volume, are important in determining the overall energy consumption of the VRF systems. An ANN model [34] was developed an ANN model to predict energy-efficient operating set-points for VRF cooling systems. Through data collection and analysis, the model optimizes cooling energy consumption by adjusting control variables such as air supply and condenser temperatures, demonstrating accuracy in reducing energy use while maintaining thermal comfort. Additionally, an optimal start control strategy for VRF system [35] was developed using a data-driven model to reduce energy consumption, demonstrating an average energy saving of approximately 30.5 %. Similar study [36] proposes a method to improve energy efficiency in residential building by optimizing the heating and cooling thermostat set-points of VRF systems, demonstrating that multi-objective optimization can reduce energy consumption. The indoor temperature set-point control algorithm [37] was developed according to the electricity prices in the VRF system. The results show that heating energy consumption was reduced by 17.8 %, and cooling energy consumption by 4.0 %. The set-point control in VRF systems is a key strategy for balancing energy efficiency and indoor comfort. However, existing studies have mostly relied on simulation environment or limited on-site experiments to validate energy savings. Simulations often fail to reflect the dynamic nature of real-world conditions, while on-site experiments typically yield results specific to particular scenarios. Additionally, variables like building structure, materials, and external environmental factors differ significantly across buildings, which makes it hard to develop a universal control strategy. To address this issue, we propose new control strategy that integrates deep learning and intelligent load control (DL-ILC). The DL-ILC strategy turns indoor units on and off based on dynamic load prioritization, utilizing both quantitative data and qualitative rules. The novelty of this study is to demonstrate and evaluate the DL-ILC that employ target consumption adjustment based on the accurate prediction of daily and hourly power consumption of VRF, as key element in enabling dynamic load prioritization process in response to time varying inputs. The paper presents seq2seq model with attention mechanism that are feasible in three commercial buildings with VRFs and discusses the energy savings performance of VRF control using the results from the field test. The proposed strategy is able to manage the controllable indoor units of VRFs to maintain the electricity consumption at a desired target level without having a significant effect on occupant comfort under different outdoor operating conditions (heating and cooling season). The control can be easily deployed on low-cost computing platforms without the need for any additional sensing. Compared to our previous reported work, the contributions of this paper are threefold. 1) The DL-ILC, which respond to environmental variables, were developed, demonstrated, and evaluated for VRFs in three commercial buildings. The new control strategy is described for optimal adjustment of the desired target level based on predicted consumption using the optimized seq2seq model. The attention mechanism and Bayesian optimization was used to strengthen the recognition of the complicated physical processes of VRFs under various operating conditions. 2) The ability of the VRF control to turn individual indoor units on and off according to dynamic loads prioritization using both quantitative inputs and qualitative rules in a unique feature that provides an advantage over other control methods. The proposed control enables the VRFs to communicate and coordinate to minimize the number of indoor units unnecessarily running concurrently, thereby reducing electricity consumption at a desired target level without having a significant effect on occupant comfort. 3) The DL-ILC can be deployed on low-cost computing platforms which can be easily installed and integrated with existing commercial buildings. The proposed control has the ability to quickly \u201cconnect\u201d to the existing building control system and data, the ability to quickly generate the necessary algorithms for DL and optimal control that apply to a specific site and minimal additional sensor requirements. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the method of the DL-ILC algorithm applied in this paper. This section describes the structure and optimization method of the DL models, target setting, and control processes. Section 3 provides a description of the test bed infrastructure for the field testing of the control algorithm described above. Using this environment, we performed field experiments using three buildings to which the DL-ILC will be deployed shown in Section 4. This paper is concluded with a discussion of the experimental results in Section 5. 2 Methodology The DL-ILC aims to regulate the controllable load of VRFs in a building, ensuring that the dynamic electricity consumption does not exceed the desired target level. Predicting the dynamic electricity consumption involves estimating future daily and hourly consumption by considering factors such as historical data, environmental elements, and usage patterns. Seq2seq with attention mechanism are used for time series prediction. The desired target consumption levels are determined and adjusted for controlling VRFs. The dynamic loads priority process prioritizes all controllable indoor units in VRF using the AHP and curtails the loads to achieve the peak demand target during the event based on the adjusted target level. When the control ends, the priority process transitions the curtailed indoor units back to normal set-point temperature and avoids the post-event control rebound effect. The details of how DL-ILC strategy was configured to manage VRF systems are described in this section. 2.1 Seq2seq model with attention mechanism In this study, we propose a seq2seq model with attention mechanism to improve the accuracy of VRF power consumption predictions. This section includes the following processes: 1) data preprocessing and feature selection, 2) seq2seq model, 3) attention mechanism, 4) model learning and validation. Once, time-series data related to VRF power consumption is collected. The collected data is arranged in chronological order, and missing values are processed to transform the data into an analyzable form. Next, important points that affect power consumption are identified through a feature selection process. Through this process, important input variables for the model to learn are selected. The preprocessed data is split into training and test datasets, and the seq2seq model with an attention mechanism is trained. The model's hyperparameters are optimized using Bayesian optimization. After finding the optimal hyperparameters, the trained model is applied to the test data to validate its performance. 2.1.1 Data preprocessing and feature selection Data preprocessing is the process of transforming raw data into a useful and understandable format to obtain better forecasting model performance and involves handling inconsistent formatting, human errors, and incomplete data. The data preprocessing proceeds as shown in Fig. 1 . Data preprocessing was conducted to check for null values and outliers, scale the data to a given range, and split the time-series data into training and testing subsets while retaining the temporal order. With data preprocessing, the predictive performance can be improved by eliminating the inhibitors of data quality. Data integration can lead to inconsistent and redundant data points, leading to DL models with better accuracy. We must adjust the time interval for data consolidation and propagation. The power-meter dataset was matched to the VRF dataset via common time stamps to form a single dataset, increasing efficiency and productivity. The most important factor in DL model is training data. Data cleansing is the process of cleaning datasets by accounting for missing data, removing outliers, correcting inconsistent data, and smoothing noisy data and then modifying, replacing, or deleting data as necessary. Depending on the data gap, we consider three strategies to address missing data: \u2022 If the data gaps extend for no more than a few consecutive hours, we use linear interpolation to estimate the value from other observations within a range of a set of known data points. \u2022 If the data gaps range from a few hours to several days, we delete the corresponding variables or columns from dataset. \u2022 If the data gaps do not last for more than a few minutes, the data rows corresponding to such gaps are omitted from the missing data. The next step is to divide the entire dataset into training and testing datasets. First, data scaling was achieved by normalizing the input and output variables. The purpose of normalization is to transform data in a way that datasets are either dimensionless or have similar distributions. This ensures that no attribute is more important than the others because of the data ranges. Feature selection is the process for extracting automatically meaningful features from a set of VRF data and thus can reduce the number of input variables to minimize the computational complexity and prevent overfitting in the model development. In this study, the feature selection based Pearson-correlation [38] and Random-forest [39] methods are used to filter out the irrelevant and redundant features from the original feature set, and thus the pool size of candidate features is reduced by evaluating the input variables of VRFs with regard to their impacts on the accuracy of load forecasting model. Table 1 presents the results of feature selection using the Pearson correlation and Random forest techniques. Pearson correlation is a quantitative measure of the linear correlation between each feature and the target variable. It has a value between −1 and 1 that indicates the extent to which two variables are linearly relationship. Random forest uses bagging and randomized node optimization to construct various decision trees. Bagging is a way of selecting parts of data and making decisions on only this data when building a decision tree. Randomized node optimization is performed to find branches to divide branches by targeting only some features when defining criteria for dividing data in nodes, which reduces the variation in the tree performance. In this research, the features whose absolute value of the Pearson correlation coefficient was ≥ 0.3 were selected and the features with a random-forest feature importance of ≥ 0.05 were selected. For the Pearson-correlation and Random-forest methods, 11 and 15 feature variables, respectively, that affected the power consumption of the VRF system were selected among the 45 feature variables for the outdoor unit and the 16 feature variables for a single indoor unit. Seven more features are added to a feature set of Pearson correlation to form a feature set of Random forest. In this study, the input features of Pearson correlation were used for the electricity load prediction of VRF system. 2.1.2 Seq2seq model Standard recurrent architectures are not well-equipped to model relationships between sequences whose lengths differ. To improve the flexibility of the load forecasting, a different architecture based on LSTM called seq2seq is used to map sequences of different lengths. One way to address this is to use two LSTMs: an encoder LSTM which transforms a sequence of inputs to a single hidden vector, and a decoder LSTM which transforms this hidden vector into a sequence of outputs. Seq2seq model was proposed to more effectively deal with variable-length input and output sequences. The encoder is a recurrent network that converts inputs into internal representations and uses the entire input sequence. When all input sequence information is compressed into a fixed-length vector, the encoder sends the context vector to the decoder. In the encoder neural network, a special token called end of sentence is used at the end of a sentence to a represent the end of the input sequence. The encoder state is expressed as follows: (1) h t E n c o d e r = L S T M E n c o d e r ( x t , h t − 1 E n c o d e r ) The decoder, which is known as the generative network, converts the internal representation into the output. The decoder can be expressed as shown in Fig. 2 . For the seq2seq model, the training and test processes differ slightly. To generate the target output sequence, the decoder neural network whose starting state is initialized with the context vector of the encoder neural network is used, and it predicts the next data and inserts these data into the LSTM cell input at the next instant of time. The decoder state is expressed as follows: (2) h t D e c o d e r = L S T M D e c o d e r ( y t − 1 , h t − 1 D e c o d e r ) When increasing the depth of the network (number of layers) or the number of neurons per layer in an LSTM, the model's capacity to learn complex patterns improves. However, increasing the depth of the network and the number of neurons per hidden layer cannot improve the performance of the proposed model for testing data up to a limited number of layers, which is considered overfitting. Therefore, when designing an LSTM model, it's essential to balance network complexity and incorporate regularization techniques like dropout to prevent overfitting. 2.1.3 Attention mechanism In a seq2seq model, the encoder compresses the input sequence into a fixed-length vector. However, as the length of the input sequence increases, there can be a loss of information. For long input sequences, it becomes challenging for the encoder to capture all the intricate details of the input sequence while compressing the information into a fixed-size vector. The attention mechanism [40] has been proposed as an enhancement to the encoder-decoder architecture. It is inserted between the encoder and decoder in the seq2seq model, allowing the model to selectively focus on important information at each position of the input sequence. With the attention mechanism, the model dynamically assigns attention weights to different parts of the input sequence, prioritizing relevant information for the current decoding step. Fig. 3 shows the process of the seq2seq with attention model. The input sequence passed through the LSTM layer of the encoder, resulting in hidden states at each time step. The hidden states of the encoder can be seen as vectors that contain input information at each position in the sequence. The decoder receives an initial state, such as a start token, as input. The decoder calculates the similarity between current state and the encoder's hidden states. This determines how much \u2018attention\u2019 should be given to the encoder's information at each time. The obtained weights which is called attention values from the similarity calculation are combined with the encoder's outputs to serve as inputs to the decoder. The decoder uses this information to generate the next output and transition to the next state, iteratively generating the output sequence. To calculate the proportion of values representing each relation to the entire input sequence, we obtained an attention weight where the sum of all values was 1 by converting them into values from 0 to 1 using the Softmax function. Each attention weight must be combined into one to apply it to the output value. To obtain the attention value, the weighted sum was obtained by multiplying the hidden states of the encoder from h 1 to h t and the corresponding attention weight values. The attention value is expressed as follows: (3) α t = ∑ k = 1 t α k t ∙ h k where α t is attention value and S t is hidden state of the decoder. After calculating the attention value, it was converted into one vector by concatenating it with the hidden state of the decoder. The converted vector can be passed through the dense layer and the hyperbolic tangent function, and the new output of the decoder can be calculated as expressed below: (4) s t ˜ = tanh ( W [ α t ; s t ] + b c ) where s t ˜ is output vector of decoder at time t, W is weight matrix, and b c is bias value. 2.1.4 Model learning and validation DL model performance can be improved by utilizing a proper optimizer and performing hyperparameter tuning. This process should be guided by the specific objective of the model (e.g., classification, prediction, etc.) and the characteristics of the data. Different optimizer algorithms (e.g., Adam, RMSprop, SGD) serve different purposes. For example, the stochastic gradient descent is one of many algorithms that directly optimizes a function. Bayesian optimization, on another hand, approximates the optimized function and uses the approximation to suggest educated parameter values. Bayesian optimization generally leads to better performance in hyperparameter tuning because it uses a probabilistic model to guide the search for the best parameters. It learns from previous evaluations and directs the search towards the most promising hyperparameters, which often leads to finding better values than different optimizers. Bayesian optimization consists of a surrogate model and an acquisition function. The surrogate model improves the optimal function model based on recommendations from the acquisition function. It is a probabilistic model constructed based on previous input and output data, estimating the form of the function and its uncertainty. The acquisition function selects the next input to evaluate using the surrogate model. It balances between exploration and exploitation during the search process for finding the optimal function, considering the uncertainty of the surrogate model. The acquisition function calculates the most promising input values. Bayesian optimization find the parameter that minimize the objective function within a finite domain. Bayesian optimization is expressed as follows: (5) x ∗ = arg min f ( x ) where f ( x ) is objective function, x is input variables, and x ∗ is optimized input value. In Bayesian optimization, the domain of each variable is defined by lower and upper bounds. Table 2 presents the maximum and minimum values of the hyperparameter search domain for optimization. DL model has six hyperparameters, such as the as the number of layers, the number of neurons in a layer, the learning rate, dropout rate, L2 regularization coefficient, and batch size. Bayesian optimization considers past evaluation results when selecting the next hyperparameter set. The computational complexity of a hyperparameter tuning process depends on the number of hyperparameters. Although we can simultaneously specify six hyperparameters, limiting search to a smaller number can reduce computation time. Hyperparameter optimization is performed by minimizing the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the predicted results using testing data. The maximum number of iterations is set to 10,000 times. Increasing the depth of the network and the number of neurons per hidden layer cannot improve the performance of the proposed model for testing data up to a limited number of layers, which is considered overfitting. Reducing computation time allows the DL model to converge more quickly to an optimal hyperparameter configuration. Especially, the learning rate determines the step size at each iteration while moving towards a minimum of the loss function. A lower learning rate might make the model converge slowly, but it can also help avoid overshooting and overfitting. On the other hand, a larger learning rate might speed up the convergence. Still, it can cause the model to miss the optimal solution. Bayesian optimization uses probability theory to predict the most promising learning rate candidate based on previously evaluated learning rates. The performance of the developed seq2seq and attention mechanism models was evaluated by comparing its outputs to the measured data. In the evaluation, two commonly used statistical metrics, the CvRMSE and mean bias error (MBE), were calculated. CvRMSE, derived from Equation (6), indicates the extent of deviation between the measured values and the model predictions. Meanwhile, MBE, calculated using Equation (7), indicates the model tends to overestimate or underestimate. In this study, the model is periodically updated, and the optimal model is determined by comparing the performance of the past and current models. According to ASHRAE Guideline 14 [41], prediction of the model is considered accurate when the MBE is less than 10 % and the CvRMSE is less than 30 %. Therefore, if both the past and current models meet these criteria, the model with the lower CvRMSE is selected as the optimal model.

These models predict daily and hourly VRF power consumption, determine target consumption, and adjust target level. For target load control, ILC can be used to manage VRF systems by dynamically prioritizing indoor units. This section describe the self-adjustment of target consumption, dynamic loads prioritization process, and VRF load control method. 2.2.1 Predicting algorithm for self-adjustment of target consumption Daily model is used to predict the power consumption for an entire day, while hourly model is employed to forecast the power consumption within each hour. For self-adjustment of target consumption, ILC algorithm determines daily reduced target level and adjusts hourly target level. The daily reduced target level is consist of daily reduction power and adjust power. The daily reduction power is determined by multiplying the daily power consumption by a pre-defined reduction rate. The residual power is the surplus or shortage of power based on the target consumption for the previous day. The daily reduced target level is the sum of daily reduction power and residual power, and is represented as: (8) P d , t r e d u c e = P d , t p r e d i c t × R + P d , t p r e d i c t ∑ t = 1 24 P d , t p r e d i c t × P d , t − 1 a d j u s t where P d , t r e d u c e is daily reduced target level, P d , t p r e d i c t is daily predicted power consumption, R is reduction rate, and P d , t − 1 a d j u s t is adjust power for the previous day. To provide quick feedback on the uncertainty of building load, the hourly model is used to adjust the hourly target level. The hourly target level is expressed as follows: (9) P h , t t a r g e t = P h , t p r e d i c t − P d , t r e d u c e where P h , t t a r g e t is hourly target level and P h , t p r e d i c t is hourly predicted power consumption. Target consumption is adjusted by the hourly target level, and any surplus or shortage of power is carried over to the next timestep as follows: (10) P d , t + 1 r e d u c e = P d , t r e d u c e − ( P h , t t a r g e t − P h , t m e a s u r e d ) where P h , t m e a s u r e d is actual power consumption. After a day of control, the adjust power for the next day is determined by comparing the daily reduced target level and the actual power consumption. The adjust power is expressed as follows: (11) P d , t a d j u s t = ∑ t = 1 24 P d , t r e d u c e − ∑ t = 1 24 ( P h , t p r e d i c t − P h , t m e a s u r e d ) 2.2.2 Dynamic loads prioritization process Once the target level is determined, it is necessary to decide which indoor units to control based on the dynamic loads prioritization process. In the process, if certain indoor units are deemed more important or have a greater impact on energy consumption than others, their control can be prioritized. The dynamic load prioritization process employs analytic hierarchy process (AHP) [42]. The AHP is a technique used to analyze and make judgments about complex decision-making processes by quantifying the weights of decision criteria. It involves pairwise comparisons to derive the priority of elements, enabling the quantification of decision criteria weights and facilitating informed decision-making. 2.2.3 Dynamic loads prioritization process Fig. 4 shows the dynamic loads prioritization process. The main objective is to prioritize VRF units that can be curtailed to adjust target consumption. The middle-level encompasses five distinct criteria (selected by user). The lowest level comprises alternatives, which encompasses all VRF units that are coordinated to curtail energy consumption. The criteria are divided into quantitative and qualitative standards, and quantitative standards include differences between indoor temperature and set temperature, indoor unit operation time, indoor temperature change, power consumption, and type of zone. To assign weights to each criterion, a pairwise comparison is performed. The relative importance is assessed using a numerical scale ranging from 1 to 9. The eigenvector denotes the relative order of importance among the criteria. The pairwise matrix is normalized by multiplying the summation of each column with its inverse to compute the normalized matrix, as shown in Equation (12). The eigenvector is obtained by taking the average across the rows, as shown in Equation (13). (12) A n = [ a 11 ∑ i = 1 n a i 1 ⋯ a 1 n ∑ i = 1 n a i n ⋮ ⋱ ⋮ a n 1 ∑ i = 1 n a i 1 ⋯ a n n ∑ i = 1 n a i n ] (13) v = [ 1 n ∑ j = 1 n ( a 1 j ∑ i = 1 n a i j ) ⋮ 1 n ∑ j = 1 n ( a n j ∑ i = 1 n a i j ) ] where A n is normalized pairwise matrix, a is numerical comparison, v is Eigen vector, and n is number of factors. To determine the consistency of the importance calculation results, consistency ratio is measured as shown in Equation (14). Random index is defined as 1.12 according to the random index table [43]. (14) C I = λ max − n n − 1 , C R = C I R I where C I is consistency index, C R is consistency ratio, R I is random index, and λ max is maximum Eigen value of matrix A . The process of constructing a pairwise comparison matrix and calculating the weight in this paper is shown in Fig. 5 . The most important criterion for prioritizing the VRF units is difference between room temperature and set-point ( Δ T z o n e − s e t ), followed by indoor temperature change ( Δ T z o n e ), power consumption of VRF ( P v r f ), indoor unit operating time ( t v r f ), and type of zone ( z o n e v r f ). The proposed DL-ILC strategy change the VRF set-points to adjust target consumption. The VRF load control method is consist of curtail and revert events. The curtail event triggers when the actual power consumption exceed desired target level, and the revert event triggers when the actual power consumption below the desired target level. Additionally, the revert event run 30 min after the curtail event is triggered for maintaining comfort. The VRF load control method determines the number of indoor units to be curtailed or reverted by the difference between the actual power consumption and hourly target level. According to priority of each zone, curtail or revert events are triggered from the highest priority rooms first. The curtail and revert events are shown in Equation (15) and Equation (16), respectively. (15) P h , t m e a s u r e d − P h , t t a r g e t ≤ min ( ∑ i = 1 m P i n d [ C o r d , i ] ∙ u i n d [ C o r d , i ] ) (16) P h , t t a r g e t − P h , t measured ≥ max ( ∑ i = 1 m P i n d [ C o r d , i n v , i ] ∙ u i n d [ C o r d , i n v , i ] ) where P i n d is power consumption of relevant indoor unit, C o r d , i is indoor unit priority, u i n d is indoor unit operating status, and C o r d , i n v , i is indoor unit inverse priority 3 Experiment and test conditions To effectively operate an energy management system that includes multiple buildings, a communication and control infrastructure is required to integrate the DL-ILC algorithms and building management system (BMS). This can be achieved using an agent-based platform. The agent-based platform, which is low-cost computing platform, consists of distributed agents that interact, communicate, and share information between systems. This section provides a detailed description of the testbed construction and the buildings used in the field tests. 3.1 Building control testbed To apply the proposed DL-ILC strategy for field testing, this study has developed an agent-based platform testbed. Fig. 6 shows the structure of the agent-based DL-ILC algorithm. The platform can record data and provide reports on energy usage, information critical to the process of evaluating and improving the efficiency of VRF systems. The testbed consists of three parts: plant & database, server, and client. In the plant & database part, the control-relevant data was extracted from the target building. The MySQL database stores information about the indoor unit, outdoor unit, and power-meter. It further utilizes a REST API to transmit the data for the model learning to the server. The IoT database receives real-time data from the BMS and transmits it to the client, enabling decision-making and control algorithms to be executed. The IoT server receives control signals and forwards them to the BMS. Server and client are composed of agents, and the communication between agents is achieved through ActiveMQ. The agent was constructed in a python development environment and deploys ActiveMQ clients via STOMP modules. Server deals with data preprocessing and model learning, whereas client provides the optimal control of VRF system operations. The server conducts model training and testing, storing the trained model information, and updating the model. In the model updating process, we can decide the best model which is used in the client part. The server comprises several agents, including the data publisher agent, load forecasting agent, and SSH server agent. The data publisher agent retrieves data from the MySQL database, and classifies the structured dataset with feature columns. Once the dataset is prepared, the data publisher agent saves it as a CSV file and publishes a running message to trigger the load forecasting agent. When the load forecasting agent subscribes to the running message from the data publisher agent, the load forecasting agent trains and evaluates the model. There are three different model consisting of the updated model, latest model, and best model. The updated model has all the updated model information since the first version was created. The latest model is the latest version, and the best model has the lowest CvRMSE. The SSH server agent is responsible for delivering the best model to the client. A secure copy protocol (SCP) is used for secure data and file transfer between the server and client. The SSH server agent reads model path and subscription message from the SSH client agent. Upon receiving the information from the SSH client, the SSH server agent releases the best model to the client. The client part consists of target agent, send agent, control agent, and electric load control (ELC) agent. The target agent receives the predicted values from the target model and forwards the target levels to the send agent. The send agent collects indoor and outdoor unit data in real-time, and can access the plant database using Rest API through the Psycopg2 module. The control agent sends the indoor unit control schedule delivered from the ELC agent to the BMS, and controls the indoor unit by accessing it remotely through the Request module. The ELC agent compares the current power consumption and target level, and determines the control and sends set-point signal to the indoor unit through the control agent. 3.2 Equipment specification and test conditions Field test was implemented on three buildings at Chonnam National University located in Gwangju, South Korea. To verify the broad application prospects of the control algorithm, field-tests were conducted on three buildings consisting of different room types, and the description of each building is summarized in Table 3 . The first building (Building 1) is known as the educational building, and it is a seven-story educational building consisting of lecture rooms, halls, and student lounge. The building occupancy time is from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., and the occupancy pattern is determined by the lecture schedule for each day of the week, and the night and weekend schedules occur intermittently. The VRF system of this building has two outdoor units installed on each floor, and 5 to 11 indoor units are connected to each outdoor unit. Two indoor units were installed in the hall and student lounge on each floor, and the lecture rooms were divided into small, medium, and large classrooms according to size; one indoor unit is installed in the small lecture room, and two indoor units are installed in the medium and large lecture room. The application of the proposed algorithm was demonstrated on 10 outdoor units and 70 indoor units installed on the 2nd to 6th floors of the building. The second building (Building 2), a library, is a four-story building consisting of a study lounge, group study room, and a presentation room. The opening time of the building is from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m., and the cooling/heating schedule of the educational room, data room, and lounge is the same regardless of the day of the week, but the schedule of the group study room and presentation room is not fixed because it depends on the user's reservation. The first and second floors use system air conditioners, whereas the third and fourth floors use air handling units (AHUs), so the demonstration was conducted on four outdoor units and 52 indoor units installed on the first and second floors. The four outdoor units have different capacities, and the number and type of indoor units connected to each outdoor unit vary. There is one indoor unit installed for individual reservations, such as group study room, presentation room, and 4 to 13 indoor units are installed in open spaces, such as study lounge, multimedia room. The last building (Building 3), a college of agriculture, is a very old building built in 1977. The building is a five-story educational building consisting of a lecture room and a laboratory. The main usage time of the building is from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. and the occupancy time of the lecture rooms varies depending on the lecture schedule. The application of the control algorithm in this building was demonstrated on two outdoor units and 12 indoor units installed on the third floor. All 12 indoor units have the same capacity, and two indoor units are installed in each lecture room and three indoor units are installed in each laboratory. Table 4 summarizes the characteristics of the VRF system. Building 2 was installed relatively recently compared to the other buildings, so it is distinguished by its performance. The capacity of the outdoor units connected to the indoor units depends on the size and purpose of each building. It is also important to note that the system uses the refrigerant R410A. Fig. 7 shows the temperature, wind speed, sunshine duration, and solar irradiance in Gwangju, South Korea, for the year 2023. The first graph shows the changes in outdoor temperature, with the red line representing the average temperature, the blue line representing the maximum daily temperature, and the green line representing the minimum daily temperature. The graph indicates that the maximum temperature exceeded 30 °C during the summer, while the temperature dropped below freezing during the winter. The second graph depicts the average and maximum wind speeds. The red line shows the generally stable average wind speed over most of the period, while the blue line visualizes the maximum wind speed, highlighting stronger winds during the spring and summer months. The third graph shows the changes in sunshine duration and solar irradiance. The red line represents the daily sunshine duration, showing a pattern of longer sunshine hours during the spring and summer, which gradually shorten in the fall and winter. The blue line represents total solar irradiance, following a similar pattern with the highest irradiance recorded during the summer. 4 Result and discussion This section shows the prediction performance of DL models and the field test results of the DL-ILC algorithm. The DL models are divided into a daily model and an hourly model. The daily model employs seq2seq, while the hourly model incorporates an attention mechanism. The field tests were conducted to evaluate the performance in cooling and heating modes for the three buildings mentioned in the previous section. Further details will be presented in the subsequent section. 4.1 Performance of the deep learning model In the seq2seq model, two types of time-interval data were used to identify power consumption patterns. The hourly interval data is useful for capturing overall long-term trends. On the other hand, the 10-min interval data allows for more detailed analysis of short-term fluctuations in power consumption, making it suitable for target consumption. For training the model, data from the same season of the previous year was used. Fig. 8 shows a daily model prediction results. The results compare the daily model predictions with the measured power consumption over two weeks in summer and winter. The daily model uses hourly interval data. The input length is 24, and the output length is also set to 24. The daily model uses the data from the day before the target period as input to predict the next 24 h. The first graph shows the power consumption pattern during the summer, and the measurements and predictions display similar trends. The power consumption in summer has large fluctuations during peak hours. Although the predicted values deviate from the measurements during some peak periods, the overall pattern aligns with daily fluctuations. The second graph shows the power consumption pattern during the winter. The predicted values closely match the measurements, capturing the daily fluctuations in power consumption. The performance of the daily model is a CvRMSE of 16.2 % and MBE of 5.0 % in summer and CvRMSE of 16.1 % and MBE of 9.3 % in winter. Overall, in both results, the daily model effectively captures the measured power consumption patterns, successfully predicting the increase and decrease of power consumption. Fig. 9 shows an hourly model prediction results. The results compare the hourly model predictions with the measured power consumptions from two models: seq2seq without attention and with attention. The hourly model uses 10-min interval data. The input length is 12, and the output length is 6. The hourly model uses data from the 2 h before the target hour as input to predict the next 1 h. The first graph shows the power consumption pattern of building 1. Comparing the measurements with the results of the two prediction models, seq2seq with attention generally predicts the consumption pattern more accurately. The second graph shows the power consumption pattern of building 2. In this building as well, seq2seq with attention corresponds more closely with the measurements and accurately reflects peak times. In contrast, seq2seq without attention tends to either underestimate or overestimate in certain intervals. The third graph shows the power consumption pattern of building 3. Similar to the other buildings, seq2seq with attention demonstrates better predictive performance and follows a pattern closer to the measurements. On the other hand, seq2seq without attention shows a greater deviation from the measurements, particularly during peak times. Table 5 represents the prediction accuracy of the seq2seq model using winter data. When building 1 data was used, the seq2seq model with attention provided improved predictions (MBE of 0.9 % and CvRMSE of 10.8 %) compared to the model without attention (MBE of 6.8 % and CvRMSE of 12.8 %). In three buildings, the CvRMSE of seq2seq without Attention is approximately 13 %, and the CvRMSE of seq2seq with Attention is about 11 %. Overall, applying the attention mechanism shows better tracking of measurements and more accurate. This is because the attention mechanism focuses more on important time periods and better captures nonlinear patterns. Additionally, this characteristic of ignore noise and focusing on meaningful information enhances the performance of prediction. 4.2 Effect of load control The integration of proposed daily and hourly models with control algorithms is an approach used to optimize or control systems. A daily model is used to forecast the VRF power consumption over the next 24 h. Based on the daily forecast, the next step is to determine the daily reduced target levels for each of the 24 h. An hourly model is then used to adjust target consumption for the upcoming hour. The predicted hourly consumption is compared with the daily reduced target levels. If the forecast exceeds the target, a curtail event is triggered to reduce power consumption. If it falls below the target, a revert event is initiated to allow for increased user comfort. After applying curtail or revert events, if actual power consumption is still over or under the target level, the surplus or deficit is carried over and applied to the next hour's target level. Fig. 10 shows the results of power consumption and control events for building 1 during the field test. The orange and blue bar graphs represent the actual power consumption on the first graph. The orange dotted line represents the power consumption predicted by the daily model. The green dotted line represents the daily reduced target levels. In the baseline period, the daily forecasted values similar to the actual power consumption. Therefore, during the control period, the daily forecasted values are assumed to represent the actual power consumption. The target reduction rates are set at 15 % for the summer and 10 % for the winter season. When comparing daily reduced target levels with actual power consumption, any excess or shortfall in power consumption is adjusted and reflected in the next day's target. For example, if power consumption exceeds the daily reduced target level, the target for the next day will be lowered. Control points are displayed on the second graph as curtail and revert events. The curtail event occurs when actual power consumption exceeds the target level. On the other hand, the revert event occurs when actual power consumption below the target level. Through these two events, the system can flexibly adjust target consumption, enabling the achievement of the target reduction rate. The reduction rate in actual power consumption compared to load forecasting was observed to be 13.5 % for the summer test and 11.8 % for the winter test. Fig. 11 shows the control of the algorithm during the occupancy time and the results of the indoor unit, the left graph shows the results of the winter season and the right shows the results of the summer season. In the first graph, the blue and orange lines represent the hourly predicted power consumption and adjusted target, and the black line represents the actual power consumption in the building. The actual power consumption is similar to the adjusted target. The target is adjusted based on the saving rate each hour. When actual power consumption exceeds the adjusted target, there is a widening gap between the load forecasting and the adjusted target in the next timestep. The second graph shows the indoor unit control, the blue line indicates the number of indoor units with curtail control, and the red line indicates the number of indoor units with revert control. When power consumption exceeds the target, a curtail event occurs, using temperature adjustment in the VRF systems to reduce the power consumption. Once the power consumption falls below the target levels or after a pre-defined period has passed, a revert event is triggered. This event restores normal operations, aiming to enhance occupant comfort and adjusted target. The other three graphs show the VRF indoor unit status. The red line represents the set temperature, the blue line represents the room temperature, the yellow line represents the on/off state of the indoor unit, and the orange line represents the actual thermal operation of the indoor unit. Depending on curtail or revert events, set temperature of each room is changed, and distributed control is applied based on priority. During optimal control, the zone temperature is managed within a set temperature range, ensuring that user comfort is maintained. Fig. 12 shows the results of the summer and winter field tests for building 2. In the baseline period, the load forecasting values closely follow the trend of actual power consumption, indicating that the prediction model based on historical data is performing accurately. During the control period, the target values match the actual power consumption, suggesting that the control strategy is effectively regulating power consumption as intended. When the power consumption exceeds the target values, more curtail events are triggered to reduce power consumption as much as possible. As a results, summer test results for building 2 achieved 8.7 % of the 10 % reduction target, and the winter test results achieved 16.7 % of the 15 % reduction target. The results of the power consumption and indoor units in building 2 are shown in Fig. 13 . Building 2 includes an open space (smart lounge), which is regularly utilized by multiple people. It also has individual spaces (multimedia room and educational room) that can be reserved for personal use. The fluctuations in power consumption are larger compared to building 1 due to the variability in the number of consumers. In the summer, it can be observed that the adjusted target follows power consumption in most time periods. Distributed control is conducted based on the priority of the zones. In the case of winter, the difference between load forecasting and the adjusted target is narrow, as the daily adjustment reflects the result of exceeding reduction rate from the previous day. The adjusted target is lower than the power consumption due to an unexpected increase in electricity usage compared to the daily prediction. The residual power caused by fluctuations is reflected in the adjusted target for the next day. Fig. 14 shows the summer and winter field test results for building 3. Building 3, although an educational facility, includes laboratory spaces and does not follow a fixed schedule like building 1. During the baseline period, the model generally follows the trend of actual power consumption, and during the control period, it can be observed that the target and actual power consumption are similar. When the target is lower than actual power consumption, curtail and revert events triggers more frequently. This indicates that when power consumption exceeds the predicted target, the system takes more actions to adjust. The summer test results for building 3 achieved 9.7 % of the 10 % reduction target, while the winter test results achieved 15.3 % of the 15 % reduction target. Fig. 15 shows the operating status results of indoor units and power consumption in building 3. In both seasons, the adjusted target for power consumption generally follows the actual power consumption patterns. In summer, the target tends to predict slightly higher power consumption, but in many instances, the actual power consumption similar to the target. Building 3 is an old building and its VRF system and insulation performance are relatively inferior compared to those of other buildings, so the indoor temperature changes rapidly according to the heating and cooling set temperature. Therefore, when the set temperature is raised through curtail event, as shown in the summer results, the indoor unit is operating in cooling mode even though the curtail event is performed due to the increase in indoor temperature. In this case, curtail and revert events are applied more frequently to achieve the intended power savings. In the analysis of VRF system performance, white-box and gray-box models leverage the physical characteristics and mathematical models of the system. These model typically demonstrate high performance in controlled environments such as simulations or on-site experiments. However, the complexity of VRF system makes it challenging to apply these models in real-world due to various external factors (weather conditions, usage patterns, and building characteristics). To overcome these challenges, we implemented a prediction model using a seq2seq with attention to address these issue and apply it to real-world VRF systems. However, when a single model is used to predict energy consumption in actual buildings, it may not fully reflect abrupt schedule changes or external factors. For these reasons, we propose two models (daily and hourly models) to predict daily and hourly power consumption patterns. This approach allows for a more detailed understanding of VRF system energy consumption, making it more suitable for real-time predictions. As a result, the developed model met the performance criteria set by ASHRAE Guideline 14. In general, the set-point control of thermostat can be optimized while considering occupant thermal comfort based on a comprehensive knowledge of several factors such as the outdoor environment and the thermal dynamics of VRFs. It is often challenging when controlling the set-point of thermostat because of a lack of information about the characteristics of buildings and VRFs. The complexity of implementing the set-point control strategies is a significant limitation because of the high implementation costs associated with providing site-specific solutions relative to the potential savings. Additional implementation costs are due to additional sensor requirements and labor to engineer and program the site-specific solutions. For this reason, the dynamics of VRF performance have not been closely evaluated around the control strategies. In addition, the high implementation time and cost made its commercial implementation impractical. Because of these issues, the intelligent load control enabling proactive control in response to time varying inputs could be an appealing option for a conservative building manager because detailed building data such as wall thickness and material are not needed. The intelligent load control uses the analytic hierarchy process to dynamically prioritize controllable indoor units of VRFs using both quantitative (e.g., deviation of indoor temperature from set-point) and qualitative (e.g., types of zone) criteria. DL-ILC strategy integrates DL with control algorithms to predict future energy consumption, determine target levels, and adjust set-points according to prioritized energy requirements to meet the target reduction rate. Since this strategy doesn't rely on complex physical or mathematical models, it is more adaptable and can be applied to various buildings. It allows for efficient energy management without needing to precisely model the physical environment, making it a versatile solution for optimizing energy use across different building types. Table 6 summarizes the results of the field test, demonstrating that energy consumption could be reduced almost in line with the target consumption determined by the building's energy consumption prediction model. Additionally, by applying ILC, it was confirmed that the priority control within the set temperature range of the building allowed the average indoor temperature to remain within the desired values, maintaining a comfortable environment. These results suggest the potential applicability of DL-ILC in real-world settings. However, there are some limitations. To apply DL-ILC to a new building, a sufficient amount of data must be collected for DL model training. This necessitates consideration of both the setup of data communication infrastructure and the time required for data collection. By utilizing transfer learning, the knowledge from a pre-trained model can be applied to a new environment, thereby reducing the time required for data collection and model training. Furthermore, the way each company controls the compressor in the VRF system can be significantly different. Due to these differences in control mechanism, logic, and operating conditions depending on the manufacturer or model, it can be challenging to control the compressor in a unified way. If there is a common standard control mechanism, it would be possible to control the compressor. 5 Conclusion The overall goal of this work was to develop the DL-ILC and demonstrate that it can be used to manage the electricity consumption of VRFs at the desired level. The real-time availability of information reflecting both the status of the electricity consumption of VRFs and the internal status of controllable indoor units, makes it possible to find an optimal trade-off between the conflicting objectives of building electricity consumption savings and thermal comfort levels. True optimization can only be achieved through accurate prediction of the power consumption of the VRFs being controlled. In this paper, we proposed a daily and hourly load-forecasting method based on a seq2seq model with attention mechanism for VRF systems. Additionally, hyperparameter optimization was used to improve the performance of the load-forecasting model. The error analysis of the optimized model in the CvRMSE proved the stability of the prediction results. The analysis of output sequence length revealed the maximum CvRMSE was 11 % (hourly) and 16 % (daily), which is significantly lower than the ASHRAE guideline 14 of 30 %. The overall results of the analysis indicate that the optimizing seq2seq model properly predicts the electricity consumption for different time-varying inputs and control signals of VRF systems. Based on the prediction accuracy, the suggested model was demonstrated to be suitable for application in the intelligent load control algorithm for optimal operation of the VRF system. It was shown that the optimized-Seq2Seq models, which can be implemented on low-cost computing platforms without the need for any additional sensing, provide satisfactory results for describing the power consumption of VRF systems. DL model was integrated into the intelligent load control to manage the VRFs in the buildings to maintain the electricity consumption at the desired level without a significant impact on occupant comfort. It was furthermore demonstrated how the prediction of total future consumption of VRFs can be used to maintain the electricity consumption at a desired target level. The ability of ILC to manage electricity consumption for two different use cases (10 and 15 percent reduction) under different outdoor operating conditions (heating and cooling season) was demonstrated in three commercial buildings. Based on the test results, ILC was able to manage the VRFs with multiple indoor units to maintain the electricity consumption at a desired target level without having a significant effect on occupant comfort. The control strategy can reduce the electricity consumption between 10 percent and 15 percent. The flexible loads of VRFs can be leveraged to lower the total energy cost. Practical results that have been achieved up to date emphasizes the importance of establishing optimal control limits for controllable indoor units of VRFs. In this paper, a new technique has the built-in capability to automatically adjust the target electricity consumption based on the time series of load forecasting of seq2seq model with attention mechanism. Due to the nature of the behavior of controllable/curtailable loads, they can only influence the consumption levels over relatively short periods, if no inconvenience is allowed. When DL predicts the base electrical load into the future over such a time period, the ILC can proactively adjust the target consumption level to a realistically attainable level, even before that level of consumption has actually been reached by VRFs. In this way, ILC can save its available curtailable loads until the expected future consumption levels indicate that the curtailable indoor units of VRFs can be released. The system will therefore maintain a target level that equals the average predicted total electricity consumption level over the specified forecasting window. By anticipating future demand, the process can be extended to add advanced control features, such as optimal start and stop control, to alleviate comfort issues when the VRFs are controlled to reduce the electricity consumption. Although the ILC described and validated in this research was highly tailored to work with VRFs, it can be generalized and applied to multiple controllable loads in a building, such as lighting loads and water heaters.

        "dc:description": "Variable refrigerant flow (VRF) air-conditioning systems have seen significant growth in Asia and its application is expanding globally. Despite the expanded application, most previous studies have focused on developing fault detection and diagnostics to achieve energy-efficient operations than on predicting power consumption. It's very difficult to predict the electrical consumption owing to its complex system configuration and various control strategies. A new control strategy is described for optimal adjustment of the desired target level based on time series forecasting using the optimized sequence to sequence model for VRF systems. Sequence to sequence (seq2seq) model with attention mechanism and Bayesian optimization is developed to predict accurate hourly and daily forecasts and rapid feedback control for fluctuating power consumption for VRF systems. The optimized seq2seq model is integrated into the intelligent load control (ILC). ILC can be used to manage VRF systems by dynamically prioritizing indoor units for curtailment using both quantitative inputs and qualitative rules. Overall, the results demonstrate that the deep learning based control allows coordination of the controllable loads of VRF systems in three commercial buildings. ILC with deep learning manages the power consumption within a desired target level, as well as indoor temperature reflecting the status of controlled indoor units, as objective functions of the control algorithm.",
