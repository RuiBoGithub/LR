Advanced controls could enhance buildings\u2019 energy efficiency and operational flexibility while guaranteeing the indoor comfort. The control performance of reinforcement learning (RL) and model predictive control (MPC) have been widely studied in the literature. However, in existing studies, the reinforcement learning and model predictive control are tested in separate environments, making it challenging to directly compare their performance. In this paper, RL and MPC controls are implemented and compared with traditional rule-based controls in an open-source virtual environment to control a heat pump system of a residential house. The RL controllers were developed with three widely-used algorithms: Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), Dueling Deep Q Networks (DDQN), and Soft Actor Critic (SAC), and the MPC controller was developed using reduced-order thermal resistance-capacity network model. The building optimization testing (BOPTEST) framework is employed as a standardized virtual building simulator to conduct this study. The test case BOPTEST Hydronic Heat Pump is selected for the assessment and benchmarking of the control performance, data efficiency, implementation efforts and computational demands of the RL and MPC controllers. The comparison results revealed that for the RL controllers, only the DDPG algorithm outperforms the baseline controller in both the typical and peak heating scenarios. The MPC controller is superior to the RL and baseline controllers in both two scenarios because it can take the best possible action based on the current system state even with a model that deviates to a certain degree from reality. The findings of this study shed light on the selection of advanced building controllers among two promising candidates: MPC and RL.

The Heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system typically accounts for around 50 % of overall building energy use [2], and is expected to consume more energy with the on-going trend of global warming [3]. Reducing the HVAC system energy consumption is critical for low carbon development. Advanced building control is a promising technology to minimize the HVAC system energy use, provide load flexibility, reduce the connected grid overvoltage risks [4], as well as improve the indoor environment quality [5\u20137]. Conventional building control set the environment control goals (such as temperature set-points) based on a pre-determined schedule, and then adopts set-point tracking algorithms such as proportional-integral-derivative (PID) to track the set-point. This strategy is widely adopted by the building industry due to their robustness and simplicity. However, this rule based control (RBC) approach is unable to respond to exogenous factors such as electricity price, weather conditions, and demand response signals in the most efficient way. In addition, the performance of the controller heavily relies on the PID parameters tuning, which is often a cumbersome process. To address the limitations of the conventional building control strategies, increasing research attention has been focused on the development of optimal control strategies for building HVAC systems. There are two major categories of optimal control strategies: model-based and model-free methods, depending on whether a system model is needed by the controller. 1.1 Existing work Model predictive control (MPC) is a model-based constrained optimal control method that was first applied in industrial processes and is currently state-of-the-art for building controls. It searches for the optimal control actions by minimizing a given objective function over a finite prediction horizon. In MPC, a system model is needed, which will be used to predict and optimize the future behavior of building energy system together with current state measurements and disturbances forecasts [8]. Numerous studies show that MPC has a number of advantages over traditional control strategies. An MPC framework was developed and demonstrated by Merema et al. [9] for an all-air system that optimize supply air temperature and airflow rate so as to minimize the weighted sum of CO2 concentrations, thermal comfort and energy use. The calculated energy savings for the implemented MPC strategies were, in turn, 10 % \u2013 40 % for electric energy use and 21 % \u2013 55 % for thermal energy use. Xu et al. [10] developed the robust model-based predictive control for a constant air volume air-conditioning system to regulate the openness of the cooling coil valve with the cost function defined as setpoint tracking error. The MPC strategy was shown to be able to deal with constraints and allow stable and robust control without jeopardizing thermal comfort when the results were compared with PID. West et al. [11] presented an experimental demonstration of the MPC on air conditioners of two office buildings in Australia. The multi-objective optimization minimizes running cost and CO2 emissions, subject to operator preferences, while constraining occupant thermal discomfort to an acceptable range to find the best zone temperature set-point schedule Results presented from real-world trials have demonstrated energy improvement between 19 and 32 % over existing control strategies. The findings are in line with other experimental studies showing over 20 % of energy savings for a variable air volume system in a research laboratory [12], over 20 % of energy savings for a hybrid heating system in an office building [13] and a primary energy reduction of 17 % for a thermally activated building system in an office building [14]. In general, MPC works well in terms of satisfying constraints, ensuring robustness, reducing energy uses and operational costs. However, model development is a necessary step to deploy a MPC controller, which is time and expertise demanding [15]. Another promising strategy for HVAC system control is reinforcement learning (RL). RL is a model-free optimal control strategy, which is believed to be able to reduce the efforts needed for model development. As a branch of machine learning, RL has successful applications in fields such as gaming [16] and robotics [17]. RL adopts a trial-and-error approach: the agent interacts with the environment, trying different actions, observing the consequences, and learning from those experiences to maximize the cumulative reward. Deep RL (DRL) leverages the recent advancement of deep learning, which utilizes the neural networks as the function approximator to improve RL\u2019s performance when the problem is in a continuous, high-dimensional state-action space. Deep RL is very suitable for the building HVAC system control as the building HVAC system is a typical nonlinear, time-varying and uncertain complex system [18]. Several researchers have utilized RL technique to the field of HVAC system control, such as in the control of heating terminal units of the heating subsystem [19\u201322], control of air-conditioning(AC) units of the cooling subsystem [23\u201326], control of ventilation fans or windows of the ventilation subsystem [27\u201329], hybrid control of-the cooling and ventilation subsystems [30,31] and hybrid control of a whole HVAC system [32]. Brandi et al. [19] applied Deep Q Networks(DQN) algorithm to control supply water temperature of a gas boiler and defined the reward function as the weighted sum of heating energy to water and temperature difference between zone temperature setpoint and outdoor air temperature achieving the energy saving between 5 % and 12 %. Gao et al. [25] adopted Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm to control the set-point air temperature and humidity of the AC units. The authors defined the reward function as the weighted sum of energy use and thermal discomfort and the results confirming that DDPG agent can achieve lower energy use and higher thermal comfort compared with the baseline controller. In [30] the authors implemented the Double Deep Q learning (DDQN) algorithm to control the setpoint air temperature of the AC units and on/off of the ventilation fan with the reward function defined as the weighted sum of normalized Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) [33] index, CO2 level and power usage. The result shows that DRL controller delivers a better indoor thermal environment and lower CO2 concentration level, meanwhile reduced energy use by 4 %-5%. 1.2 Objectives As the representative of the model-based and model-free optimal control strategy, MPC and RL demonstrate good performance in HVAC control. Many researchers developed MPC and RL controllers and compared their performance with RBC. However, very few studies directly compared MPC and RL in terms of control performance, data efficiency, implementation efforts and computational time. This study aims to fill in this research gap. In this work, we developed MPC and DRL controller for space heating systems, and compared their performance in one virtual testbed, examining the control behavior, quantifying the control performance. This study aims to shed light on the comparison of model-based and model-free optimal control methods. We first introduced the test environment, and implementation details of MPC and DRL in Section 2. The control behavior and performance will be presented in Section 3. We will then discuss and compare MPC, DRL and conventional RBC in Section 4 before we conclude in Section 5. 2 Methods 2.1 Test environment 2.1.1 Virtual testbed We use the building optimization testing (BOPTEST) framework [34] to benchmark MPC, DRL, and RBC controllers. BOPTEST is a standardized virtual building simulator that includes multiple physics-based building models with predefined baseline controllers. One major benefit BOPTEST can provide is it is fully open-source and freely accessible. 2 2 https://github.com/ibpsa/project1-boptest. The transparency ensures the results are reproducible. The conceptual framework of BOPTEST is plotted in Fig. 1 . The building models are written in Modelica and exported as a Functional Mockup Units (FMU) and then encapsulated in the docker container together with boundary conditions and external disturbances including one year weather and occupancy data. The RESTful APIs are used to exchange data between building models and the external controller. The external controller can read the measurement and forecasting data, overwrite the control signal, select test case, set simulation scenarios and advance the simulation through the RESTful application programming interfaces (APIs). BOPTEST also defines a series of standardized key performance indicators (KPIs) for fair performance evaluation including energy use, thermal discomfort, operational cost, indoor air quality discomfort, emissions and computational time ratio and user can also define their own KPIs in it. Besides, six testing scenarios generated by the combination of two heating periods (peak and typical) and three electricity price profiles (constant, dynamic, and highly dynamic) are available for each building model. Particularly, to train the RL controllers, the environment is wrapped up as BOPTEST-Gym [35], which is an OpenAI Gym that enables the RL controllers to communicate with the BOPTEST emulators by providing a series of standard APIs. Fig. 2 shows the interaction process between the RL controller and BOPTEST simulation environment with the aid of BOPTEST-Gym. 2.1.2 Building envelope and heating system The test case used in this research is BESTEST Hydronic Heat Pump, which represents a single zone dwelling in Belgium depicted in Fig. 3 . Five family members live in this single zone building with a 12 × 16 meters rectangular floor plan, a 2.7 m high ceiling and several south-oriented windows. The heading demand of the case study residential building is approximately 80 W/m2 in winter. There are several measurement and control variables available from BOPTEST environment. In Fig. 3, U indicates the control signal, P indicates the measured electric power, and Q indicates thermal power. T z represents the measured zone operative temperature. The residential dwelling is occupied by five people before 7 am and after 8 pm on weekdays and full-time on weekends. For the comfort conditions, the zone operative temperature should remain within 21\u201324 °C during occupied hours and otherwise 15\u201330 °C. The heating system consists of an air-to-water modulating heat pump of 15 kW nominal thermal capacity and 3.5 kW nominal power consumption, which is coupled to a floor heating system. A PI controller, the representative of RBC, is embedded in this test case and it is well-tuned with relatively good performance. The PI controller is used to initialize the system during the warmup period and serves as the benchmark compared with MPC and DRL controller. Furthermore, the emulator also consists of two testing periods for the assessment, including the peak heating period and the typical heating period. 2.1.3 Performance baseline and evaluation metrics In this work, a fine-tuned Proportional-Integrative (PI) logic controller serves as the baseline to evaluate and benchmark other control algorithms. It takes the zone operative temperature T Z as input and the heat pump modulation signal u hp as output as shown in Fig. 4 . The output is computed to drive the zone operative temperature towards its set point. As our objective is to minimize the thermal discomfort and operational cost, the overall performance is assessed by total operational cost and thermal discomfort. 2.2 Reinforcement learning implementation Generally, the HVAC control problem can be expressed as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with the five-tuple: (1) M = < S , A , P , R , γ > where S 1): state space, a set of states which represents what the agent sees. A 2): action space, a set of actions which represent what the agent does. P 3): state transition probability matrix, it stands for the probability of jumping from the current state s at given action a to the next state s \u2032 , the mathematical expression is shown in Eq.(2): (2) P s s \u2032 a = P r ( s t + 1 = s \u2032 | s t = s , a t = a ) R 4): reward function, it describes the reward obtained by a state-action pair: (s, a), the mathematical expression is shown in Eq.(3): (3) R s a = E [ R t + 1 | S t = s , A t = a ] γ 5): discount factor, it assigns value to future rewards; γ ∈ 0 , 1 . γ = 0 implies the agent only considers the current reward and γ = 1 means to assign the future rewards with the same weight. Mathematically, γ helps to stabilize the training of RL controller. Practically, γ means current rewards are more valuable than future rewards. The goal of RL controller is to minimize the operational cost while maintaining the thermal comfort. As shown in Fig. 5 , in the learning process, the agent constantly interacts with the HVAC system. It perceives the state s t , based on which selects and executes the action a t , then it receives an intermediate reward r t + 1 and observes the next state s t + 1 from the environment. The agent repeatedly improves the policy until the convergence of the optimal policy. Fig. 6 shows the flowchart of the training and testing experiments. Based on the Hydronic Heat Pump emulator, the simulation results are obtained through testing the well-trained RL agent in the testing environments which only includes the peak or typical heating period. 2.2.1 Design of state space There are a lot of outputs provided by the emulator model. Selection of the state space is critical for RL controller\u2019s performance. The state variable needs to be a comprehensive representation of the current and forecasted states, which should give sufficient information that is relevant to the agent\u2019s decision making. On the other hand, irrelevant and repeated information should be deleted to avoid overfitting and the curse of dimensionality. After some experiments, we finally selected the state space with the eight variables shown in Table 1 . The reasons why we select the below state variables are as follows, \u2022 The time of week is a good indicator for the occupant schedule, as well as the internal heat gains from equipment, lighting, and occupants. Because the schedules of occupant, equipment, and lighting have a weekly variation and are a function of time. \u2022 Zone operative temperature and the comfort temperature range determines the occupant comfort and should be considered when controlling the heat pump. \u2022 Electricity price informs the timing and magnitude of pre-heating as our objective is to minimize the overall heating costs. \u2022 The ambient temperature, solar irradiation and occupancy gains inform the total heat gain of the space, which needs to be considered for heat pump control. As the building has thermal mass, we extend the dimension of the temperature measurement T z by including its past observations within a time window (regressive time Δ t r ). The new dimension of T z would increase to 1 + Δ t r / Δ t s , where Δ t s is the step time. Likewise, we can also extend the dimension of the disturbances\u2019 variables: λ , T _ , T ¯ , T a , Q rad ̇ , Q occ ̇ by incorporating future prediction within a time window (forecasting time Δ t f ). Therefore, the new dimension of a disturbances variable would increase to 1 + Δ t f / Δ t s . For example, if the step time Δ t s = 15 min, regressive time Δ t r = 6 h and forecasting time Δ t f = 3 h, then the total dimension of the state space is computed as follows: (4) S = n t + n m · ( 1 + n r ) + n d · ( 1 + n f ) 1 + 1 × ( 1 + 6 × 60 m i n 15 m i n ) + 6 × ( 1 + ( 3 × 60 m i n 15 m i n ) ) = 104 Note that too large dimensional state space would make the algorithm difficult to converge. We have to choose an appropriate state space dimension, balancing the performance and complexity. Δ t s , Δ t r , and Δ t f are hyper-parameters to be tuned. In this paper, we selected the step time as 15 min, regressive time as 6 h and forecasting time as 24 h for the environment parameters setting. Hence, the state space dimension is 608. 2.2.2 Design of action space The heat flow to the floor heating is controlled by the heat pump modulating signal. The decision variable in this case is the heat pump modulating signal, which should keep the building within the comfort range. The range of action space, the heat pump modulating signal, is [0,1] with the symbol u h p , namely A = u h p and A ∈ 0 , 1 . Specially, as DDQN algorithm works in the discrete action space, we choose to partition the action into 10 uniform intervals before passing them to the agent. For the discrete action space of heat pump modulating signal, A = { 0 , 1 10 , 2 10 , ⋯ , 1 } , the dimension of action space equals to 11. Note that the number of uniform intervals is a hyperparameter of the environment that can vary depending on the specific experiment. 2.2.3 Reward function A well-designed reward function can enhance learning and speed up convergence [36]. Since our objective is to minimize the thermal discomfort and operation cost, the reward function is designed as a weighted sum of these two goals. Thermal discomfort represents the cumulative deviation of the zone operative temperature out of the upper and lower comfort zone during the given time period with the unit of Kh . Operational cost quantifies the operational cost under the specific pricing scenario during a specific time period with the unit of \u20ac / m 2 . In addition, there are three pricing profiles in the BOPTEST framework namely: Constant Electricity Price, Dynamic Electricity Price, Highly Dynamic Electricity Price. The mathematical representation of the objective function is shown in Eq.(5). (5) J k = C + ω · δ where C is the operational cost and δ is the thermal discomfort. ω is the weight parameter to balance the trade-off of operational cost and thermal discomfort, which is another critical hyper-parameter to be tuned. The value of operation cost and thermal discomfort could be obtained by calling the APIs: requests.get(\u201c{}/ kpi\u201d.format(url))[\u201ccost_tot\u201d]} and requests.get(\u201c{}/kpi\u201d.format(url))[\u201ctdis_tot\u201d]}, respectively. Since we want to maximize the cumulative reward, the immediate reward at time t k + 1 thus could be defined as follows: (6) r k + 1 = - ( J k + 1 - J k ) A critical decision in designing the reward function is how to determine the value of the weight ω , which aims to manage the trade-off between operational costs and thermal comfort. A larger value of ω means the thermal comfort is more important compared with the operational costs. Different occupants may have different opinions in terms of how important thermal comfort is. Theoretically, the weight should be selected based on occupants\u2019 preference, which can be elicited through survey. However, the investigation on how to select ω is beyond the scope of this study, as the goal of this study is to compare different control algorithms. We assigned the value of weight parameter ω as 10, which of course can be tuned in other applications. 2.2.4 Algorithms To deal with large state spaces, function approximation using the deep neural networks (DNN) is required to develop the Deep RL agents. We implemented and benchmarked three state-of-the-art Deep RL algorithms incorporate DNN as an approximator: Double Deep Q Learning (DDQN), Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) and Soft Actor Critic (SAC) [37], utilizing the stable baseline3 package [38]. The reasons why we choose these three algorithms are as follows: 1) In our HVAC control problem, the action space is continuous. While DDPG and SAC algorithm are naturally suited for dealing with continuous state space and action space. In addition, SAC achieves state-of the-art results on a range of continuous control benchmarks[39]. 2) The DQN is the most extensively utilized algorithm for building energy system optimization because of its discrete action space and DDQN is an improved version of DQN [40], which solves the problem of overestimating Q value. Hence, we are interested in exploring the performance of DDQN in our testcase. 3) These three algorithms perform well in the previous work about building energy management. For example, Li et al. [41] applied the DDQN agent to operate an ice storage air conditioning system in a small office building obtaining better performance in terms of reducing operating cost and the proportion of uncomfortable time, Touzani et al. [5] proposed the DDPG agent to optimize the operation of distributed energy resources (DER) systems with the cost savings of up to 39.6 %, Brandi et al. [42] implemented the SAC agent to control the heating system achieve 2 %- 6 % energy saving and up to 65 % thermal comfort improvement. DDQN is a value-based algorithm with a high convergence speed that trains the network parameters using stochastic gradient descent strategy. It does not directly find all maximum Q values calculated by the target network, but first selects action a max corresponding to the maximum Q value using the estimate network, then calculates the target Q value y i according to a m a x by the target network. DDQN commonly generates discrete actions and struggles with the continuous action space. Discretizing continuous actions into several discrete actions is necessary to make DDQN compatible with continuous action spaces issues. To overcome the disadvantage of DDQN, Silver et al. [43] proposed a new algorithm called DDPG for the deterministic continuous action space. DDPG is a combination of Actor-Critic framework and DQN, making use of the existing advantages of DQN (target networks and replay buffer) while outputting continuous actions [44]. It is a state-of-the-art algorithm for continuous control problems and has a disadvantage of overestimation of the value function and low exploration ability. Similar to DDQN, DDPG learns two neural networks, an estimate network and a target network for both the actor agent and critic agent and has a total of four neural networks. The role of the actor is to deterministically output a specific action based on a given state instead of generating the probability distribution over a discrete action space. The critic approximates the value function to evaluate the expected return given the action-state pair it takes. SAC is an extended version of DDPG that optimizes a stochastic policy by an off-policy approach. It is well-known for the better sample efficiency, strong exploration and generalization ability but suffers from the unstable training process. SAC uses entropy regularization to solve the inefficient exploration issue in the latter training stage of DDQN and DDPG. The objective of the entropy regularization is to randomize the strategy as much as possible, which avoids being trapped in local optimal, while maximizing the expected return. 2.2.5 Hyper-parameter tuning Because of the excessive training duration of an agent, to tune the hyperparameters, we adopted a manual method that varies one hyperparameter at a time and evaluates how the learning process and performance change. We mainly focus on tuning the learning rate, minibatch sampling size, discount factor and fully connected network. The final hyperparameters of these three agents are summarized in Table 2 . This method is easy to implement and fast but comes along with the challenge on finding the best hyperparameter configurations since it often stuck in a local optima. We also tried the Python\u2019s Optuna library, an automatic hyperparameter optimization framework [45]. However, since BOPTEST-Gym does not support parallel computing which also leads to an extremely long tuning time, we did not successfully implement it on the agents and failed to find the globally optimal hyper parameter configurations. The one-year weather data, occupancy schedules and electricity price data from Brussels (Belgium) are used for the model training and testing. The electricity price comprises three price scenarios including constant, dynamic and highly dynamic profiles. The constant price scenario keeps a constant electricity price at 0.2535 \u20ac/kWh. The dynamic scenario applies a dual rate scheme that contains a peak price at 0.2666 \u20ac/kWh between 7:00 a.m. and 10:00p.m., and an off-peak price at 0.2383 \u20ac/kWh between 10:00p.m. and 7:00 a.m. For the highly dynamic scenario, it uses the Belgian day-ahead energy prices as determined by the BELPEX wholesale electricity market in the year 2019 [46]. In this work, the highly dynamic electricity price profile is considered. The controller is tested in the peak heating period (January 17th-31st) and typical heating period (April 19th-May 3rd), and trained with the data that excludes the peak and typical heating periods during the year. 2.3 Model predictive control implementation 2.3.1 Model of building envelope A data-driven grey-box building model consisting of a thermal resistance\u2013capacitance network (RC) is developed to simulate the building thermal dynamics. The first-order RC model is used in this study because it leads to a convex optimization (to be more specific, linear programming) problem, the global of which can be easily found. Fig. 7 shows the lumped parameter and RC representations of building model, including only one system state Tz that refers to the zone operative temperature. Based on the RC network representation, the state parameter can be derived as follows: (7) C d T z dt = T w - T z R + q HVAC + q inter + A × I solar where C is the thermal capacitance of the zone and the envelops (K m2/W), R is the resistance to heat exchange between the outdoors and envelops (kJ kg/K). Tw represents the outdoor temperature (K) and Isolar is the solar irradiation (W/m2). q HVAC is the heat influx brought by the heating system (W) and q inter is the internal heat load due to occupants, lighting and indoor equipment (W). A refers to the effective area of the windows. Based on the above RC model, a continuous-time, linear state space model is developed with the system state × = [Tz ], the input vector u = [Q HAVC] and the disturbance vector d = [Tw , Qinter , Isolar ]T. Because the MPC controller will be implemented in discrete time domain, the continuous-time state space model needs to be discretized as shown in Eq. (8). (8) x k + 1 = A d x k + B d u k + E d d k where Ad , Bd , Ed are the matrices of the discrete-time state space model depending on the sampling time. Once this state-space formulation is stacked in time series, the control input and the system state are in an explicit linear relation, which is a suitable form for implementation in the MPC controller. The simplified RC building model is calibrated and refined using operational data generated by the emulator. We gathered two weeks of simulation data with the baseline controller to train and validate a grey-box building model for use within the MPC. In the RC building model, the parameters R and C of building components are the key factors that affect the simulation performance. Thus, the R and C parameters are tuned in this calibration procedure. They are assigned an estimated value and bounded to the range of 0 and positive infinity. The Nelder-Mead optimization method [47] is then employed to tune the RC model. This approach delivers a good agreement between the predicted room temperature and the \u201cmeasured\u201d zone operative temperature in the emulator, as shown in Fig. 8 . 2.3.2 Model of heat pump Simplified models are developed to predict the heating output and power consumption of the heat pump. The power consumption and heating output is fitted as linear function of the heat pump control signal, as shown in Eqs. (9) and (10). The power consumption and heating output of the heat pump could be approximated by two-week data. (9) P = 1290.1 × u hp + 1115.4 (10) Q = 7221.4 × u hp + 2220.0 where P and Q are the power consumption (W) and the heating output of the heat pump (W), respectively. uhp represents the heat pump signal. In Fig. 9 , the predicted data are compared with the training data. It can be seen that the prediction error is within 15 % for all power consumption data, and over 93 % of the heating output data. The coefficient of determination R 2 for the power consumption and the heating capacity models are 0.98 and 0.93, which indicates a high accuracy for the prediction models developed in this section. 2.3.3 MPC formulation Unlike the baseline controller that tracks the zone operative setpoint temperature, the objective of the MPC controller is to minimize the energy cost and minimize the deviation of zone operative temperature from its set point. The optimization problem is formulated in Eq. (11). The optimization module employs an IPOPT solver [48], which is a nonlinear optimization solver included in the CasADi [49] toolbox. This approach is widely used for its versatility and robustness. (11.a) J = min ∫ t = t k t k + Δ t h p e × P + ω T z - T sp 2 d t (11.b) x k + 1 = A d x k + B d u k + E d d k (11.c) 21 ⩽ T z ⩽ 24 Occupied , 15 ⩽ T z ⩽ 30 Unoccupied (11.d) 0 ⩽ u hp ⩽ 1 The two terms on the right-hand-side of (11.a) refer to energy cost and thermal discomfort, respectively. The first term is the energy cost calculated by multiplying the electricity consumption P varying between 0 and the nominal power consumption of 3.5 kW with the ToU (Time of Use) electricity price pe (\u20ac/kWh) that uses the Belgian day-ahead energy prices as determined by the wholesale electricity market in the year 2019. Tsp refers to the zone operative setpoint that is specified as 22.5 °C (mean of the upper and lower bound) in this study. The weighting factor ω manages the trade-off between energy cost and thermal discomfort, which is a key hyper-parameter to be tuned. We selected 2150 after testing different values. There are three constraints for this optimization problem. First, the system thermal dynamics need to be respected as a constraint (11.b). Second, the zone operative temperature Tz needs to remain within the temperature range 21 °C − 24 °C during the occupied time and otherwise 15 °C − 30 °C (11.c). Third, the heat pump signal uhp , is controlled between 0 and 1. Because of the relatively large thermal mass of the target building, we selected the control step to be an hour, which is adequate to capture the building dynamics. An unnecessarily short control time step leads to the excessive computation burden. The prediction horizon is set as 12 h. 3 Results 3.1 Reinforcement learning We compared the three RL algorithms during the training phase in Fig. 10 . It shows the training process of the three RL algorithms: DDQN, DDPG and SAC. A clear upward trend in turns of reward (as defined in Eq. (5)) can be observed with increasing training steps, which reflects that the RL agents can successfully learn through interacting with the environment. Approaching convergence, the average return of DDPG agent reaches the highest level among the three, while the average return of DDQN agent is the lowest. Although SAC agent learns faster at the early stage, its reward at convergence is lower than DDPG. Fig. 11 compares the performance of 3 RL algorithms during the testing phase. As we introduced before, we conducted a training\u2013testing split, and therefore the testing periods were not included in the training phase. The black dot represents the baseline PI controller, which has been fine-tuned and embedded in BOPTEST. Similar to what we observed during the training phase, DDPG agent performs the best among all controllers during both the two testing periods \u2013 peak and typical heating periods. All RL controllers perform better than the baseline controller in reducing thermal discomfort in the peak heating period. However, DDQN and SAC agents fail to maintain the zone operative temperature within the comfort range during the typical heating period with higher thermal discomfort. We also observe that the SAC agent performs poorly in the operational cost. In detailed, as shown in Fig. 12 , the DDPG agent exceeds the baseline controller in both the comfort and energy metrics with a reduction of the thermal discomfort by 92 % and 18 % and a saving of the operational cost by 11 % and 14 % during the peak and typical heating periods, respectively. It is worth to mention that this result depends on the weighting factor between comfort and energy (ω in Eq. (5)) we selected. Different weighting factors lead to varying trade-off between comfort and energy. Fig. 13 plots the indoor temperature variations, accumulated thermal discomfort, and operational costs during the testing period. The peak and typical heat periods last for two weeks. During the majority of time, the indoor temperature was controlled within the comfort range. The baseline PI controller maintains the indoor temperature at the lower end of the comfort range, indicating the baseline controller is well-tuned and should have a good energy performance. However, the control strategy of \u201cmaintaining the indoor temperature close to the lower bound of comfort zone\u201d leads to high chance of comfort violation, especially at the beginning of occupied periods, when the comfort bound starts to be tightened. Even compared with this energy-efficient baseline, DDPG has a better performance on both the comfort and cost metrics. The cost saving comes from adjusting the heating schedule based on the Time-of-Use utility price. DDPG can learn to pre-heat the building when the ToU price is lower. As the result, the heating energy is shifting from the time when ToU price is high to the time when ToU price is low. This strategy leads to lower operational costs while guaranteeing the thermal comfort. We will discuss this more in the discussion session, when we compare the control actions suggested by DDPG, MPC, and RBC controllers. Occasionally, the indoor temperature might rise above the upper bound of the comfort range, which is a result of high outdoor temperature and large solar heat gain (as Jan. 21st during peak heating period). As only heating is provided, the degree of freedom of this control system is 1. As a result, comfort violation sometimes is unavoidable, especially during the typical heating period. An example is on Apr. 20th, when the outdoor temperature reached 15 °C while the solar radiation reached 800 W. We can see the four controllers (three RL agents and PI baseline) selected different approaches to deal with this relatively hot day. DDQN controller decided to maintain a lower-than-comfortable temperature at the beginning of this hot day to maintain the indoor temperature lower than upper bound during the mid-day but at the cost of violating the comfort constraint at the early morning. In contrary, DDPG, SAC and PI controllers maintained the indoor temperature at the lower end of the comfort range in the morning, which unavoidably lead to a higher-than-comfortable temperature during the mid-day. Numerical simulation found that the second strategy outperforms the first in terms of the accumulated discomfort as shown in Fig. 15 (b). 3.2 Model predictive control The control performance of the MPC and baseline PI controllers are plotted in Fig. 14 . As introduced in the previous section, the baseline PI controller is already well-tuned and very energy-efficient, as it aims to maintain the indoor temperature at the lower bound of the comfort range. Even compared with this well-tuned baseline controller, the MPC controller is still able to outperform the baseline controller in terms of both the thermal comfort and operational costs. As for the thermal comfort, MPC delivers a close-to-0 thermal discomfort, because we set a relatively high penalty on comfort violation. As a comparison, because the baseline PI controller targets to maintain the indoor temperature at the lower bound of the comfort range, it has a higher chance of comfort violation. In the typical heating period, the zone operational temperature starts out within the thermal comfort bounds and exceeds the upper bound at the end of the period, even though the heat pump is turned off. The reason why the temperature in the operating zone rises so quickly is because of the excessive solar radiation. The graph shows a similar pattern, with the thermal discomfort remaining around 3.5 Kh/zone in the beginning and rising quickly to 8.3 Kh/zone by the end. In terms of the operational costs, MPC controller is able to save operational costs compared with the baseline PI controller. This is attributed to the fact that the MPC controller learns an accurate representation of the heat pump and zone operative temperature behaviors in the model training process, which informs the MPC controller to take advantage of the pricing variations to reduce the total cost by preheating the zone when the electricity price is cheap. This heating load shifting behavior will be discussed further in Section 4.1.1. Fig. 15 shows the KPI values of the MPC and baseline PI controllers in two testing scenarios. The results show that the MPC controller outperforms the baseline controller with total discomfort savings of 99.8 % and 12.1 % and with total energy savings of 22.1 % and 26.8 % over entire peak and typical heating periods, respectively. It further leads to total cost savings of 21.9 % and 26.6 % and total carbon emission reductions of 22.2 % and 26.7 %, respectively. 4 Discussion 4.1 Comparison between RL, MPC and RBC 4.1.1 Control actions A key research question of this study is to compare and quantify the performance improvement of advanced building controllers (RL and MPC) compared with the conventional PI controller. Fig. 16 shows the detailed control actions and resulted indoor temperature variations at typical days during peak and typical heating periods. We selected DDPG agent as the representative of RL as it performs best compared with the other two widely-used RL algorithms. As shown in Fig. 16, all three controllers could avoid the comfort violation in most cases. Meanwhile, the RL and MPC controllers take into account the electricity price when selecting their control actions, thus they could take advantage of variability in electricity prices to reduce operating costs without sacrificing comfort by shifting the heating load from the time when the electricity is expensive to the time when the electricity is cheap. As shown in shaded area of the Fig. 16, the preheating is suggested by the RL and MPC controllers when the electricity price is cheap. However, the pricing signal is not considered by the baseline control logic. When comparing the simulation results from the two testing scenarios, it also worth noting that the cost saving during the peak heating case is marginal since the heat pump needs to be turned on for a longer period of time during peak heating period to maintain a comfortably warm temperature. The cold ambient weather condition did not offer much freedom to operate based on the pricing signal without jeopardizing thermal comfort. MPC has larger energy or cost saving potential during shoulder season is consistent with what is found in previous study [15]. Besides, the RL and MPC controllers display much more volatile actions than the baseline PI controller. The reason for this is often that the baseline controller is embedded within the Modelica model and thus it is continuous awareness of any controlled variable further as continuous controllability of any control variable. However, the RL and MPC controllers may only choose actions in each control step based on feedback from the system. The action is perhaps completely different than the expected and desires to be modified within the next step, resulting in much more volatile actions. 4.1.2 Overall energy and comfort Fig. 17 represents the key performance index of the RL, MPC and baseline controllers in peak and typical heating periods. The MPC controller outperforms the RL controller on both comfort and costs during the peak heating period. It is worth noting that in this study we adopted a 1R1C model when developing MPC controller, which is the simplest implementation of MPC. Even this inaccurate model is able to provide adequate guidance about the optimal control action at the next time step with optimization and disturbance forecast. The RL controller, in contrast, relies on a universal approximation value function trained with data to find the optimal action. The universal approximation has a large state-action space to search for the most accurate parameter and optimal action, the performance of which also relies on quantity and quality of the training data. Model-based optimization is more efficient in finding the optimal compared with model-free approach. During the typical heating period, the RL and MPC controller perform similarly: MPC outperforms in electricity costs while RL outperforms in thermal comfort. Although the advanced controllers have better control performance than the baseline controller, they will increase the computational demand and implementation efforts. Due to their different offline and online computational requirements, the RL and MPC controllers have different data efficiency and implementation efforts. The RL controller requires a high offline computational need, whereas the MPC controller has a higher online computational demand. The main reason is that the RL controller needs to interact with the building environment while being trained over a number of episodes. Once the training process is complete, there is little need for online computation because calculating the control action only requires evaluating a function. The MPC controller faces a higher online computational demand because it must solve the optimization problem at every time step. 4.1.3 Computational demand The BOPTEST provides the computational time ratio to indicate the remaining time that a controller has to compute a control action every control step, as given by Eq. (12). It defines the average ratio between the controller computation time and the test simulation control step. (12) t t 0 , t f = ∑ k = 1 n t c k T s k n where t c(k) refers to the computational time at step k. Ts (k) represents the interval of control step k. n is the number of simulation steps that take place between the initial time t0 and the final time tf . The simulation results show the computational time ratio of the RL and MPC controllers are in the order of o 10 - 4 and o 10 - 4 , whereas that of the baseline controller is in the order of o 10 - 7 . Compared with the baseline controller, the RL and MPC controllers need higher online computational demand for costs of a function evaluation and optimization, but still are reasonable online computational demand. It is also worthwhile to mention that for the RL, more computational resources are needed at the controller training stage. However, with the advancement of computational technology, higher computing demands should not be a bottleneck for the deployment of advanced building controllers. 4.2 Limitation and future work A major limitation of this study is that the RL and MPC controllers were tested in a virtual environment. Despite the fact that BOPTEST uses high-fidelity emulators for building models, these models provide a detailed representation of the dynamic system. However, some common issues in real-world application are missing in this virtual environment: noise or biases are present in real-world sensing and measurement systems, and uncertainty exists in disturbance forecasts. These uncertainties will impact the performance of ML algorithms [50] as well as the advanced building controllers, but are not yet considered in this study. How robust MPC and RL is given different levels of measurement and forecast uncertainties worth further investigation. However, on the positive side, results presented with virtual testbed are reproducible, because every researcher can download this virtual environment and run our code, or test their own controllers. In contrary, if this study was conducted in real buildings, the results might be challenging to reproduce as the environment is keeping changing and conducting experiments in real buildings is expensive. Future research should also explore tuning of hyperparameters. Important hyper-parameters include a. the hyper-parameters of RL algorithms as listed in Section 2.2; b. the order of RC model for MPC. In this study, hyper-parameters in RL are tuned using a one-at-a-time approach, which is unlikely to find the optimal. We did not perform comprehensive hyper-parameter tuning for RL because currently BOPTEST does not support parallel computing. For the MPC, we tried the 1R1C model and found it performed well. Whether and how much MPC\u2019s performance would improve when a high order RC model is used is an interesting research question. The third limitation of this study is that the RL controllers are trained with direct interaction with BOPTEST, which will overestimate the performance of RL as explained in [46]. Because in the real world, it is impractical to train RL controllers in the real buildings majorly due to the error tolerance. In real practice, the RL controller needs to be trained on an emulator. The model mismatch between the emulator and the real building might further degrade the performance of RL, especially at the beginning of RL deployment. This effect was not considered in this paper. 5 Conclusion Advanced building controllers have demonstrated their potential to meet the urgent need to reduce HVAC system's energy consumption and carbon emission, while maintaining indoor comfort. The RL and MPC controllers in terms of control performance, data efficiency, implementation effort, and computational time are evaluated and compared in this paper. The BOPTEST framework is employed as a standardized virtual building simulator, and the Hydronic Heat Pump is selected as the test case for the assessment and benchmarking of the RL and MPC controllers. Three widely used algorithms (DDPG, DDQN and SAC), were implemented as the RL controller, and 1R1C model was used to develop MPC controller. The simulation results show that all RL agents outperform the baseline controller in the peak heating scenario, however, only DDPG could outperform the baseline in the typical heating scenario. The DDPG agent exceeds the baseline controller with the reduction of the thermal discomfort by 92 % and 18 % and the saving of the operational cost by 11 % and 14 % during the peak and typical heating scenarios, respectively. As for the MPC controller, it outperforms the baseline controller with total discomfort reductions of 99.8 % and 12 % and total cost savings of 21.9 % and 26.6 % for the peak and typical heating scenarios, respectively. When comparing the MPC with the best performing RL controller (DDPG), we found the MPC performs better: during peak heating periods, MPC almost eliminates thermal discomfort while save 12 % electricity costs compared with RL controller; during typical heating periods, MPC saves 14 % electricity costs but has an 8 % higher thermal discomfort. These results confirm that model-based approach is more efficient in finding the global optimal compared with the model free approach [46]. Compared with the baseline controller, the RL and MPC controller needs higher online computational demand for online function evaluation and optimization. To be more specific, the RL controller requires more computational resources during offline training, whereas the MPC controller needs a higher online computational demand for real-time optimization at each control time step. Further research should focus on comparing the advanced controllers in the real buildings while taking into account the lack of adequate operational data to train RL controller, and uncertainty of measurement and disturbance forecasts for both RL and MPC controllers.

        "dc:description": "Advanced controls could enhance buildings\u2019 energy efficiency and operational flexibility while guaranteeing the indoor comfort. The control performance of reinforcement learning (RL) and model predictive control (MPC) have been widely studied in the literature. However, in existing studies, the reinforcement learning and model predictive control are tested in separate environments, making it challenging to directly compare their performance. In this paper, RL and MPC controls are implemented and compared with traditional rule-based controls in an open-source virtual environment to control a heat pump system of a residential house. The RL controllers were developed with three widely-used algorithms: Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), Dueling Deep Q Networks (DDQN), and Soft Actor Critic (SAC), and the MPC controller was developed using reduced-order thermal resistance-capacity network model. The building optimization testing (BOPTEST) framework is employed as a standardized virtual building simulator to conduct this study. The test case BOPTEST Hydronic Heat Pump is selected for the assessment and benchmarking of the control performance, data efficiency, implementation efforts and computational demands of the RL and MPC controllers. The comparison results revealed that for the RL controllers, only the DDPG algorithm outperforms the baseline controller in both the typical and peak heating scenarios. The MPC controller is superior to the RL and baseline controllers in both two scenarios because it can take the best possible action based on the current system state even with a model that deviates to a certain degree from reality. The findings of this study shed light on the selection of advanced building controllers among two promising candidates: MPC and RL.",
