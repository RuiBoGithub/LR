Handling Editor: X Zhao Deep learning has the inspiring potential for artificial intelligence (AI) control in data centers of smart city. However, deep learning-based method is limited when the application scenarios are cross-control or cross-conditions. This paper proposes a novel domain adaptation deep learning model and Teacher-Student (T-S) networks to diagnose the faults of Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems under cross-control modes and cross-conditions. Firstly, domain adaptation deep belief network (DBN) model is presented to enhance the cross-control generalization performance of extreme learning machine (ELM) and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) diagnosis model. Secondly, the Teacher-Student networks are constructed. With the weights learned from the DBN model in Teacher Network, the cross-conditions capacity is improved for DELM model in the Student Network. Moreover, both the single and multiple faults are experimented and validated, which includes refrigerant leakage, reduced condenser water flow and reduced evaporator flow. The experimental results show that the domain adaptation deep learning model and its T-S diagnosis networks can reach the satisfied generalization performance. For the cross-control tests, the Accuracy of proposed method can reach 91%, 89% and 80% for fault-free, REW and RCW faults. For the cross-temperature and cross-load tests, the proposed method also obtained the high Accuracy of 98% and 88%, respectively.

The heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems play essential roles in the indoor thermal comfort of buildings. In order to supply the satisfied indoor temperature and humidity, the HVAC system consumes large amount of energy. The energy consumption of HVAC may occupy 60% of total building energy consumptions [1]. Subsequently, the carbon emission of HVAC system during its full life cycle is an important part of the whole process carbon emission of the buildings [2]. It is significant to improve the operation efficiency of HVAC systems during its whole service life. The data centers, as a kind of buildings with large energy consumption, have been widely used to supply the internet service in the cities. To improve the operation efficiency of data center HVAC systems, intelligent control, smart management and effective maintenance are the key approaches. During the long-term operation, actually, the abnormities or faults may occur inevitably in the HVAC system, which may result in the decrease of thermal comfort, waste of the energy consumption. With the accumulation of gradual faults, the efficiency and reliability of HVAC system will decrease significantly. It is important to develop the effective fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) tools for the data centers, so as to avoid some unwanted operation risks. The FDD methods for HVAC systems can be classified into three types, the rules-based, the model-based and the data-driven. The rules-based and model-based approaches were firstly developed in the HVAC field, which have the successful applications in the various buildings. The rules-based diagnosis methods [3\u20135] were widely developed to diagnose the faults occurred in the chillers, air handing units and other subsystems. Through employing the expert rules constructed in advance, the specific faults or efficient operation conditions can be judged or recognized. Its limitation lies in that the expert rules are difficult to be complete. During real applications, the false alarm may occur easily when the rules are not complete or detailly constructed. On the other hand, the model-based FDD methods [6\u20138] were also deeply developed for the HVAC systems. For this diagnosis way, the physical or mathematical models are required to be constructed for the target system. Through comparing the residues of model predictions and real measurements, the faults can be detected. No matter the model-based or rules-based, they have been widely developed and applied in the real building and HVAC systems. With the development of big data and machine learning, the data-driven FDD approaches attract more and more attentions. The statistic models, constructed upon the historical operation data, are employed to discover the abnormity and diagnose the fault source. The statistical residues are calculated and analyzed during the diagnosis process. The machine learning approaches can be divided into two classifications: the supervised learning and unsupervised learning. The supervised learning approaches include neural network [9], support vector machine [10], random forest [11] etc. Generally, the supervised learning models show good robust capacity for the noisy data and they can reach the satisfied diagnosis performance. The unsupervised learning approaches were also paid attention, which includes association rule mining [12], principal component analysis [13] and clustering analysis [14] etc. There is no need to label the training datasets manually, which can save the labor costs to some extent. Li presented an improved decision tree model to diagnose the faults of the variable refrigerant flow (VRF) system using the virtual sensor fault indicators [15]. Using the sensitive fault indicators, Xiao proposed the chiller diagnosis model to detect seven common faults [16]. Zhao developed the Bayesian belief network model for the HVAC system. Through using the three-layer Bayesian belief network, the faults occurred in the centrifugal chillers were diagnosed [17]. Li further applied the hierarchical object-oriented Bayesian network to diagnose the faults of air handing units [18]. Han presented the SA-DNN diagnosis model for the chillers, which merges the simulated annealing strategy into the deep neural network. The proposed model obtained the satisfied diagnosis accuracy compared with the BP neural network [19]. With the deepening of machine learning based FDD research, some deep learning algorithms have been proposed for the building HVAC systems, such as the deep learning models [20,21], recurrent neural networks [22], convolutional neural networks [23]. Zhu proposed the unsupervised density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) and deep learning models to diagnose the operational faults in HVAC systems [20]. Gao proposed the Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) method to diagnose the chiller faults. And the model was compared with the random forest and light gradient boosting machine [21]. Shahnazari developed a novel recurrent neural network model. Through integrating with the expert rules, the faults of sensors and actuators were detected in the HVAC system [22]. Elnour presented the convolutional neural networks by employing the efficient 1-D-to-2-D data transformation. The validation results show that the 2-D CNN model obtained the satisfied diagnosis accuracy for the single fault occurred in the HVAC system [23]. Li [24] employed the transfer learning algorithms to enhance the model performance for the prediction problem of energy consumption. Zhang et al. [25] proposed the weighted Manhattan distances metrics to quantify the difference between the predicted conditions and the known ones of training data in HVAC systems. Recently, researches in this field began to pay more attention on transfer learning algorithms to solve the scenarios where the training data and test data follow a different data distribution. Existing literatures are mainly focusing on solving cross-system and cross-conditions problem. For example, Zhu et al. [26] developed a domain adversarial neural network (DANN) to transfer the knowledge from data-rich source chiller in order to build a diagnostic model for new target chiller. The experiment results showed that the proposed model yielded decent performance improvement comparing with traditional machine learning methods. Similarly, Liu et al. [27] employed the pre-trained-finetuned transfer learning algorithm to solve the cross-system and cross-domain chiller FDD problem. The results showed that the finetuning algorithm could effectively improve the diagnosis performance. Sand et al. [28] utilized the transfer component analysis (TCA) and support vector machine with adapting decision boundaries to diagnose the faults of target chiller. Liang [29] et al. employed partial domain adaptation algorithm to improve the cross-operation conditions performance of FDD model. The experimental results showed that the decent performance improvement was achieved using the partial domain adaptation neural network (PADA) when the operation conditions of test data were different with those of training data. Summarily, the transfer learning approaches have been studied in the smart building applications [30]. Even though there are lots of publications in the domain of building energy systems FDD, the following knowledge gaps are still needed to be addressed. First, the existing literatures seldom considered the diagnosis scenarios of cross control logic and cross operation conditions. The investigation of FDD model performance under such scenarios is essential to its real-world application, since it is common that the operation conditions and control logic of HVAC systems will change during its whole life cycle. Second, the multiple faults scenarios were also omitted in existing literatures. During the operation of HVAC systems, it is possible that multiple faults will simultaneously occur in the single energy device. For the traditional FDD models, they can only detect the single fault, which will fail in the scenarios of multiple faults. To fill in these knowledge gaps, the main contributions of this study are summarized as follows. ● The detailed description of built chiller experiment systems is illustrated, where both the single-fault and multi-faults data are collected to develop FDD models and test their performance under cross control logic and cross operation conditions scenarios. ● A novel domain adaptation deep brief network model, combining with extra learning machine and K-nearest neighbor model, is presented to enhance the diagnosis performance of deep learning model under cross control logic scenarios. ● A novel teacher-student (T-S) learning strategy is proposed to further improve the model diagnosis performance under cross operation conditions scenarios. The rest of this paper is organized as the following sections. Section 2 illustrates the studied system and faults experimented. Section 3 introduces the methodology including the domain adaptation deep belief network model, Teacher-Student networks and T-S network-based domain adaptation DELM strategy. Section 4 illustrates the experimental validation results. Section 5 gives some discussion about the proposed method under various load conditions. Section 6 draws the final conclusion. 2 The HVAC system studied 2.1 Studied systems Fig. 1 shows the scheme of the studied HVAC system, which is composed of the water-cooled screw chiller, chilled water and cooling water system. The refrigerant cycle mainly includes the double screw compressors, two shell and tube condensers, electronic expansion valve, evaporator, regulating valves and other assisting components. The nominal refrigerant charge amount of this chiller is 100 kg. The dual-compressor chiller is the key component. Its rated cooling capacity and rated power are 400 kW and 107 kW, respectively. There is a PLC (program language controller) control system to modulate the operation of HVAC system. The sensors, including temperature, pressure, flow rate, current and power, are installed in the various positions to measure the operation status of chiller. The data acquisition module collects the measuring data of sensors and stores the operational data into the system database. The PLC controller is responsible for ON/OFF control of compressor and solenoid valves in the HVAC system. In the chiller control system, moreover, there are several control loops to maintain the required operation status of chiller. Among them, the T ESW controller is to maintain the desired chilled water temperature through adjusting the frequency of compressor or slide opening position in sequence. Its control command is calculated as the PID algorithm according to the measured chilled water temperature and its user setpoint. The T SH controller is used to maintain the required superheat temperature of compressor suction inlet, by modulating the electronic expansion valve according to the current compressor inlet superheat temperature. 2.2 Faults and the generation approach Table 1 illustrates the studied faults and the fault intensities experimented in this paper, which are commonly occurred in the real applications. Fig. 2 shows the experimental way to generate the refrigerant leakage, reduced condenser water flow and reduced evaporator water flow. The fault simulation methods are similar to those in ASHARE RP-1043 project [31]. 2.2.1 Refrigerant leakage fault (RL) Employing the refrigerant charging device and scales, the refrigerant leakage fault is simulated and generated. The experimental charge amounts are 100%, 90%, 80% and 70%, so as to simulate the scenarios of fault-free, 10%, 20% and 30% intensities of RL faults occurred in the chillers. 2.2.2 Reduced condenser water flow fault (RCW) In the experimental system, the three-way regulating valve is installed in the inlet of condenser. Through modulating the condenser water flow manually so as to simulate the reduced condenser water flow fault. The experimental fault intensities of RCW include 10%, 20% and 30% reduced condenser water flow. 2.2.3 Reduced evaporator water flow fault (REW) In the experiments, the two-way regulating valve is used to modulate the chilled water flow manually. The experimental fault intensities cover 10%, 20% and 30% reduced condenser water flow shown in Table 1. 3 Methodology 3.1 Domain adaptation deep learning 3.1.1 Deep belief network Here we firstly introduce the deep belief network (DBN), which is adopted as our basic diagnosis model. The deep belief network is a deep learning-based model, which is composed of several Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RMB). Each RBM has the visible and hidden layers. The neurons between the two layers are fully connected. RBM is a kind of symmetric connected random neural network model. The joint energy function, between the neurons v 0 of visible layer 1 and h 0 of hidden layer 1, can be calculated as equation (1). (1) E ( v 0 , h 0 | θ ) = − ∑ i = 1 N v 0 i a i − ∑ j = 1 n h 0 j b j − ∑ i = 1 N ∑ j = 1 n v 0 i w i j h 0 j # Where θ = [ a i , b j , w i j ] is the bias between the N neurons and features selected in the visible layer. b j is the bias of n neurons in hidden layers. w ij is the connected weights between the neuron v 0 of visible layer 1 and the neuron h 0 of hidden layer 1. The joint probability distribution between the two layers is expressed as: (2) P ( v 0 , h 0 | θ ) = 1 z ( θ ) e − E ( v 0 , h 0 | θ ) # In each RBM, the probability of activation between the jth neuron of hidden layer and the ith neuron of visible layer can be denoted as equations (3) and (4). (3) P ( h 0 j = 1 | v 0 ) = f ( ∑ i = 1 N v 0 i w i j + b j ) # (4) P ( v 0 i = 1 | h 0 ) = f ( ∑ j = 1 n h 0 j w i j + a i ) # The parameters of weights and biases are obtained through learning in each RBM. 3.1.2 Domain adaptation When the control logic is changed in the HVAC system, the data distribution of new control mode may be different with that of training datasets of the original control mode [32]. Consequently, the trained model may give the incorrect predictions. In this paper, the domain adaptation is used to improve the generalization performance of diagnosis model under the different control modes. The concept of domain adaptation comes from the research field of transfer learning. The basic idea of transfer learning is to utilize the data from original data distribution (named as source domain) to improve the model performance on new data distribution (named as target domain). In this paper, the source domain indicates the chiller data under original control logic, while the target domain indicates the chiller data under new control logic. In particular, the domain adaptation belongs to the type of feature-based transfer learning, where its goal is to minimize the difference of feature distribution between source domain and target domain. Once the difference of feature distribution between source domain and target domain is minimized, and at the same time, the model is trained well with source domain label data, the model performance on target domain is expected to be improved. Considering the difference between the source domain and target domain, the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) [33] is employed to measure the distance between the different related distributions. The calculation of MMD is expressed as equation (5). (5) d k 2 ( p , q ) ≜ \u2016 E x s ∼ P [ ∅ ( x s ) ] − E x t ∼ q [ ∅ ( x t ) ] \u2016 H k 2 # Where ∅ is the mapping of features. The intuitive understanding of Eq (5) is that if the source domain and target domain follow the same feature distribution, then no matter which kernel is adopted for feature mapping, their MMD distance is always 0. In contrast, if the feature distributions of source domain and target domain are different, their MMD distance will not be 0 since there will exist a kernel function making their mean feature value (after kernel mapping) different. The kernel of features can be denoted as equation (6). (6) k = ∑ u = 1 m β u k u : ∑ u = 1 m β u = 1 , β u ≥ 0 , ∀ u # where u is the enhancement of constraints for the weights. m is the summary of the feature kernels. Once the value of MMD is obtained, it will be considered in the loss function of deep belief network (DBN) so as to realize the back propagation tuning. The optimal target L of the DBN network is shown in equation (7), which includes two parts: 1) the reconstruction error of source domain; 2) the distribution error between source domain and target domain. (7) L = L C + L D = min 1 n s ∑ i = 1 n s J ( θ ( x i s ) , y i s ) + λ ∑ i = l 1 l 2 d k 2 ( D s l , D t l ) # Where D s = { x i s , y i s } i = 1 n s , n s is the label sample of source domain, θ ( x i s ) is the conditional probability of judging x i s to be y i s in DBN network. J ( . ) is the cross-entropy loss function. The stochastic gradient descent (SGD) [34], which is shown in equation (8), is used to calculate the parameters of model. (8) ∇ θ l = ∂ J ( z i ) ∂ θ l + λ ∂ J ( z i l ) ∂ θ l # 3.1.3 Domain adaptation DBN model Combined with MMD mentioned above, the domain adaptation DBN is constructed that is shown in Fig. 3 . Firstly, the operation data of chiller under various control modes may be analyzed. The common features are selected and used as the inputs of model. Secondly, the DBN model is pre-trained using the operation data of source domain. These data may belong to the same control mode. Restricted Boltzmann Machines [35] (RBM) 1 is composed of feature input layer v 1 and hidden layer h 1 . Similar construction is made for the RBM 2 and RBM 3. Once the DBN is pre-trained, the reconstruction error is calculated to evaluate the training effect of unsupervised learning. In addition, the operation data of target domain, which is corresponding to the other control mode, is used to train the pre-trained DBN model. The values of MMD between source domain and target domain are calculated, which may be used to fine-tune the parameters of model. Finally, the domain adaptation DBN model can be well trained and can be used to assist the diagnosis model under the varying control modes. 3.2 Domain adaptation deep learning diagnosis for the cross-control scenarios Fig. 4 shows the domain adaptation based deep learning strategy, which is used to diagnose the multiple faults including the following steps. Firstly, the fault representation features are extracted from the DBN model. Then the domain adaptation is carried out to tune the parameters of the model. Secondly, the DBN is combined with extreme learning machine (ELM) [36,37] to improve the diagnosis capacity of models, which is abbreviated as DELM. The parameters of DBN network learnt are transferred to the DELM model. With the outputs of the DELM model, in addition, the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) [38,39] method may give the classification of fault-free and fault types. 3.3 T-S based deep learning diagnosis models for cross-conditions 3.3.1 Basic idea of teacher-student network Besides the varying of control modes, the changing of operation condition is another aspect that limits the performance of trained diagnosis models during real applications. In order to solve this issue, the self-ensembling idea is possible solution. Actually, the self-ensembling technology reaches perfect effect in the field of image classification. As one of the self-ensembling approach, the idea of Teacher-Student (T-S) network [40] can be used in the fault classification field of energy applications. Consequently, the T-S network is constructed to improve the diagnosis capacity and generalization performance of diagnosis method in this paper. Fig. 5 shows the T-S network structure, which is composed of teacher network and student network. Firstly, the historical operation data of HVAC system may be labelled as fault-free, RL fault, RCW fault and REW fault. In addition, the teacher network gives its weights and the student network updates its weights. According to the knowledge transferred from the teacher network, the student network may give the synergetic prediction based on the target data provided by the teacher network. 3.3.2 T-S network-based DELM model The machine learning models are usually not satisfied when they are used in the real applications. One reason is that the distribution of real operation data is different with that of the training data. The deep belief network has the strong capacity of extracting the features. Consequently, the DBN is combined with extreme learning machine (ELM) to improve the diagnosis capacity of models. With the T-S strategy-based DELM, the sample features under different conditions can be mapped synchronously to the deep hidden layers, so as to eliminate the distribution difference and improve the generalization performance. In this paper, we propose a T-S strategy based DELM structure and modeling process. The Teacher Network is composed of several RBMs. The parameters of weights and biases are obtained through learning in each RBM. The obtained weights matrix is transferred to the Student Network. The extreme learning machine is selected as the Student Network. Once received the weights matrix, the Student Network has the same hidden layers and neuron quantity with the Teacher Network. Subsequently, the DELM model with same structure with its \u201cteacher\u201d can realize the transferring from the Teacher Network to Student Network. Compared with the deep neural network, it is deserved to mention that DELM doesn't need to set the network parameters manually. During the training process, the input weights and biases of hidden layer are not required to be adjusted, either. 3.3.3 T-S network-based diagnosis logic for the cross operational conditions Fig. 6 illustrates the T-S network-based diagnosis strategy for the varying operation conditions of HVAC system. Firstly, the transient data collected may be removed by the moving-window steady state judgement method. And the steady state historical data may be pre-processed and standardized. The features are selected using the Pearson correlation coefficient analysis. The domain knowledge is used to assist and determine the final features selected. Secondly, the selected feature subset is grouped in the form of RBM data. The feature extraction learning of symptom representation is carried out in the DBN network. The structure parameters of each RBM layer are optimized by the particle swarm optimization and the neuron number of each layer is obtained. The output of each RBM is used as the input of next RBM layer. In addition, the weights trained from the DBN are transferred to the ELM network. Subsequently, the DELM model in the Student Network has the same weight matrix with that of Teacher Network DBN model. With the parameter coefficients, the DELM model is well trained. Finally, the candidate test data is diagnosed by the trained DELM model. Four indices are used to evaluate the generalization performance of diagnosis models, which include Accuracy, macro-Precision, macro-Recall and macro-F1 score [41]. 4 Validation results 4.1 Experimental conditions and training datasets In this study, the HVAC system in two different control modes under the various operation conditions are experimented. 4.1.1 Control mode A The 1# compressor is modulated under the variable speed control. The 2# compressor is adjusted through modulating the slide valve. The supply chilled water temperature is set to be 7 °C. When the cooling load changes, the variable speed compressor will be adjusted first. Once its frequency is decreased to the lower limit frequency, the 2# compressor will be adjusted through decreasing the opening positions of slide valve. When the slide valve is decreased to the lower limit position, the hot gas bypass valve will be opened to meet the requirement of further decreasing of the system cooling load. 4.1.2 Control mode B The 1# and 2# compressors are modulated as the same way with control mode A. The supply chilled water temperature is set to be 7 °C, too. When the cooling load decreases, the logic of control mode B is different with that of control mode A. When the evaporating temperature is lower than its threshold, the compressor 2# will be unloaded automatically. Table 2 shows the training and test datasets of this paper, which includes the experiments under different condenser inlet water temperature conditions. 4.2 Diagnosis for the faults under varying control modes The fault-free, RCW and REW faults are experimented under the control mode A and B. The experimental data of control mode A and B are used to validate the proposed domain adaptation DBN models. The condenser inlet water temperature varies from 28 °C to 32 °C. The cooling load covers 60%, 80% and 100%. Under control mode A, we selected 626 fault-free samples, 347 REW fault samples and 350 RCW fault samples. Under control mode B, 697, 227 and 515 samples are selected for the scenarios of fault-free, REW and RCW, respectively. The t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (T-SNE) [39] is used to provide the visualization analysis for the features of model. Fig. 7 shows the T-SNE figure for the extracted features using the domain adaptation DBN method. Before feature extraction, the features are mixed up and cannot be recognized in the original feature distribution. When the dataset under control mode A is used as the source domain, the features can be better isolated in the feature distribution after extracting the features, which is shown in Fig. 7(b). Similar analysis can be made for the other scenario that the dataset of control mode B is used as the source domain. The features after extraction can be also recognized well, which means that it is more beneficial to the fault diagnosis process. The proposed domain adaptation DBN method is compared with the other three methods: support vector machine (SVM), probabilistic neural network (PNN) and DBN. The datasets of control mode A and B are selected as the sourec domain and target domain in sequence, respectively. The evaluation indices Precision, Recall and F1 score are used to evaluate the four methods. Fig. 8 shows the comparison results. It can be seen from the figure that domain adaptation DBN has the highest performance, which indicates the better generalization performance among the models. Table 3 illustrates the evaluation results for each scenario including fault-free, REW and RCW faults. If the dataset of control mode A is selected as the cource domain, the method of PNN and DBN fail to recognize the REW fault. The SVM method also has the lower diagnosis performance for both RCW and REW faults. With the domain adaptation, it should be noted that the improved DBN can reach the satistided generalization performance. On the other hand, similar results can be obtained if the dataset of control mode B is selected as the cource domain. Also, it seems the neural network-based methods, i.e., PNN and DBN, will tend to overfit the training data distribution. When the data distribution changes, the performance of two methods drops significantly. In our specific case, the two methods show poor performance for the REW fault, as shown in Table 3. Such phenomenon might be attributed to the distribution shift problem. Another potential reason might be the data imbalance problem. In the training dataset, the amount of fault-free data is much larger than that of fault data. As a result, the two methods will tend to diagnose the fault data as fault-free data under distribution shift scenarios. This demonstrates that the problem of data imblance will get worse under distribution shift scenarios. 4.3 Diagnosis of multiple faults cross temperature conditions Fig. 9 shows the T-SNE results of data distributions of original features and extracted features by RBM layers, which gives the visualization of mapping features for the cross-conditions. It can be seen that the features of different classes are mixed up in the distribution of original features (Fig. 9(a)). Moreover, the features of same class under different conditions have the larger interval of data. This indicates it may be more difficult to recognize the classes. After the feature extraction by RBM layers, the features of different fault classes may be better separated. Consequently, the generalization performance of fault diagnosis can be improved by the DBN approach. The proposed T-S network-based domain adaptation DELM-KNN model is compared with ELM-KNN and DELM-KNN. Fig. 10 illustrates the comparison results. Compared with ELM-KNN, the Accuracy of DELM-KNN is improved from 79.79% to 92.46%. With the T-S network and domain adaptation process, the diagnosis performance is further improved. Its Accuracy of T-S network-based domain adaptation DELM-KNN model reaches 98.91. Table 4 illustrates the detailed evaluation indices for each fault scenarios. Among the three diagnosis approaches, the T-S network-based domain adaptation DELM-KNN reaches the highest generalization performance. It should be noted that the ELM-KNN fails to diagnose the refrigerant leakage fault when the domain adaptation is not used. Fig. 11 give the confusion matrix of the three approaches for the cross-temperature conditions. As shown in Fig. 11, the ELM-KNN model and DELM-KNN model tend to diagnose RL fault as fault-free. The potential reason is that the amount of fault-free data is much larger than that of fault data in the training dataset. As a result, the two models tend to predict the test data as fault-free under distribution shift scenarios. It is also shown that the domain adaptation algorithm can solve such imbalance problem under distribution shift scenarios since the predictions of domain adaptive DEML-KNN match well with the actual healthy status of chiller. 5 Discussion 5.1 Various cooling load conditions of data center users The experiments of various cooling load conditions are also designed to validate the proposed T-S domain adaptation DELM-KNN model. Table 5 shows the training and test datasets of cross cooling load condition experiments in this paper, which includes the experiments under different condenser inlet water temperature conditions and different cooling load conditions of data center users. The data of 80% and 100% cooling load condition may be used as the training dataset. And the data of 60% cooling load condition is used as the test dataset. 5.2 Diagnosis of multiple faults cross load conditions Overall, the T-S domain adaptation DELM-KNN has the best diagnosis performance. Compared with original ELM-KNN, the Accuracy is improved from 83.62% to 88.82% by the T-S network and domain adaptation training. The similar conclusions can be made for the validation results of other evaluation indices. The confusing matrix are shown in Fig. 13, which also indicates the satisfied generalization performance of proposed approach. As shown in Fig. 12 , the overall performance of DA-DELM-KNN is better than traditional ELM-KNN. However, it doesn't mean that it performs perfect for all of the scenarios. In Fig. 13, the proposed method sometime tends to wrongly diagnose the RCW fault as the multiple RCW + RL faults, which performs worse than ELM-KNN for the diagnosis of this scenario. The main reason is that the proposed model is trained to balance the classification capacity among all of the scenarios. More important in real applications, the model must be trained to recognize the fault-free scenario efficiently, so as to avoid the unwanted higher false alarm rate. For the case of multiple faults, if the model predicts the healthy status of devices as one of the multiple faults; then such prediction is treated as acceptable. In the real-world scenarios, the decision maker can still utilize such predictions to make a reasonable maintenance decision. Consequently, the misdiagnosis results of this paper are acceptable in the real application. Although its diagnosis performance is not better than ELM-KNN for this individual scenario, its overall diagnosis performance is the best one. 6 Conclusions This paper presents a novel T-S network and domain adaptation deep learning method to improve the generalization performance of FDD model in the data center HVAC systems. The specific conclusions are as follows. 1) The domain adaptation DELM model combined with KNN classification approach is presented to diagnose the faults under the cross-control scenarios in HVAC systems. With the fine-tuned parameters transferred from the DBN network, the Accuracy of diagnosis model can reach 91%, 89% and 80% for the fault-free, REW and RCW faults, respectively. 2) Teacher-Student network is developed to enhance the generalization performance under the cross-condition scenarios. The DELM model in the Student Network may learn the weights trained by the DBN model in the Teacher Network. For the tests of multiple faults under cross-temperature conditions, the Accuracy can be improved to be 97.76%, 99.48% and 96.32% for the faults of RL & RCW, RL & REW and RL & RCW & REW, respectively. 3) The proposed T-S deep learning diagnosis network is also efficient for the cross-load conditions. When the load changes from 80% to 100% (training) to 60% (test), compared with original ELM-KNN, the Accuracy of T-S domain adaptation DELM-KNN is improved from 83.62% to 88.82%. The goal of this paper is to improve the performance of FDD model under new control logic and operation conditions. However, the generalization ability of proposed model for new chiller is not discussed. In future work, we will try to conduct more field experiments in different operation conditions for obtaining sufficient samples to compare with other transfer learning algorithms and verify its technical superiority. Moreover, the universal FDD model should be studied, where the FDD model can perform well on new operation conditions, new control logic and new device types. In addition, the proposed FDD model will be considered to be deployed in a real chiller to further validate its usefulness. And the interpretability of proposed FDD model will be another direction of our future work. Credit author statement Zhimin Du and Xinbin Liang conceived the idea and conducted the research.

        "dc:description": "Deep learning has the inspiring potential for artificial intelligence (AI) control in data centers of smart city. However, deep learning-based method is limited when the application scenarios are cross-control or cross-conditions. This paper proposes a novel domain adaptation deep learning model and Teacher-Student (T-S) networks to diagnose the faults of Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems under cross-control modes and cross-conditions. Firstly, domain adaptation deep belief network (DBN) model is presented to enhance the cross-control generalization performance of extreme learning machine (ELM) and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) diagnosis model. Secondly, the Teacher-Student networks are constructed. With the weights learned from the DBN model in Teacher Network, the cross-conditions capacity is improved for DELM model in the Student Network. Moreover, both the single and multiple faults are experimented and validated, which includes refrigerant leakage, reduced condenser water flow and reduced evaporator flow. The experimental results show that the domain adaptation deep learning model and its T-S diagnosis networks can reach the satisfied generalization performance. For the cross-control tests, the Accuracy of proposed method can reach 91%, 89% and 80% for fault-free, REW and RCW faults. For the cross-temperature and cross-load tests, the proposed method also obtained the high Accuracy of 98% and 88%, respectively.",
