Flexibility in buildings is a low-cost alternative to support the electricity network with high penetration of variable generation. There is a limited understanding of energy flexible behaviour of the buildings in response to electricity market signals. In this paper, the price-responsive flexible behaviour of a commercial building with a cooling system has been studied. A first-order virtual battery model of the building and flexibility function-based approach have been used to understand the flexible behaviour of the building to varying price signals. The price signals delivered changes in building electricity demand profile, altering cooling temperature set points. The building structural thermal storage capacity was found to vary depending on demand changes. Low price signals provoke positive demand changes with respect to the baseline demand, taking the system to charging mode. Similarly, high price signals lead the system to discharging mode, reducing the instantaneous charging condition of the system. HVAC operating states, e.g., free cooling/economiser cooling and mechanical cooling, have been found to have a notable impact on electricity demand flexibility. The flexibility function shows that for a very low-price value, the cooling setpoint approaches the lowest comfort bound, and demand increases significantly. A deviation between the maximum and minimum electricity demand of 207 kW for the studied building system gives an estimated maximum energy flexibility capacity of 7248.2 kWh. The response of the building to variable price signals yields flexible demand, delivering cost savings of 13 %.

Flexible energy systems can help manage the variability and uncertainty associated with renewable based generation sources. Demand side flexibility is one of the promising ways of delivering flexibility, as no additional investment in infrastructure is required to utilise this flexibility. As part of unlocking demand side flexibility, plenty of research e.g., [1\u20136] focussed on utilising flexibility from consumer side devices such as air conditioning systems, heat pumps or hot water systems in buildings. The energy flexibility of a building is defined as its ability to manage its energy demand and generation according to local climatic conditions, user needs and grid requirements [7]. Electricity markets across the globe are implementing policy and operational changes to allow relatively small-scale flexibility providers to participate in electricity markets. Flexibility can be traded via retailers or aggregators in the market. These entities act as intermediaries between the flexibility providers (house owners or commercial building owners) and flexibility buyers (electrical system operators). To trade flexibility confidently in the market, there is a need to understand and predict the flexibility characteristics of a building. Buildings with their inherent ability to store thermal energy can be used to shift electric energy consumption without impacting end-user comfort. They act similar to electric storage systems or batteries, however, charging and discharging thermal energy instead of electrical energy. While the concept of using building thermal mass as a virtual battery has been discussed in many studies, e.g., [8\u201310], methods to characterise flexibility have largely been overlooked, partly due to the challenges associated with their estimation. In contrast with an electric storage system, e.g., a battery system, where the state of charge denotes a single value in relation to the energy content of a storage medium, the storage capability of building thermal mass describes the relation between the shift in power that can be obtained at a given moment in time and the duration this shift can be maintained [11]. Besides, the flexibility capacity in a building varies continually depending upon factors, such as ambient temperature, internal/solar heat gains, and occupant behaviour [12,13]. This study utilises a virtual thermal storage model to study energy flexibility characteristics of an office building subjected to variation in cooling temperature set point changes. The flexible response of the building to cooling temperature setpoint changes is studied considering thermal mass and heat transmission properties of the building fabric. 1.1 Related work HVAC-related loads are seen as a major source of flexibility in buildings due to their ability to be ramped up and down easily without compromising occupant comfort. Various studies have investigated the demand side flexibility potential of HVAC loads. For example, Lin, et al. [14] demonstrated that HVAC systems in buildings can be used to provide satisfactory frequency regulation services in the electricity market while maintaining indoor climate. The potential of HVAC systems to provide intra-hour load balancing services was investigated by Lu [15], who demonstrated that these load balancing services meet the performance requirements and can become a major source of revenue for load-serving entities. HVAC-based demand response (DR) strategies as a means of load shedding or shifting are becoming increasingly popular as a potentially low-cost alternative for grid flexibility in place of conventional fast-ramping generation resources [16]. A range of HVAC-based DR strategies, e.g., global temperature adjustment (GTA), pre-cooling, and HVAC system adjustment techniques, have been used in different studies [17\u201321]. Among different DR strategies suitable for HVAC systems in large commercial buildings, GTA is the most widely used technique to modulate the temperature set-point of air-conditioned spaces to deliver a flexible building load. This strategy is recognized as a feature that allows commercial building operators to adjust the space temperature set-points for an entire facility with a single command from a single control location [21]. While several other HVAC-related DR strategies, such as modifying duct static pressure set-point or disengaging chiller compressor stages, only leverage the response of the HVAC control system, a GTA strategy coupled with a pre-cooling or pre-heating option leverages the thermal storage in the building [22]. Various studies, e.g., [23\u201325] have established the demand reduction potential of this approach through field tests, laboratory-based experiments, or simulation-based studies. For example, Triolo, et al. [26] estimated the aggregate cooling DR for a large number of co-located buildings to thermostat temperature set point increases and found a reduction in peak daily cooling load for the highest demand day of the year of at least 10 %. The simulation-based investigation of DR potential of office buildings performed by Li, et al. [27] showed a 10.1 % decrease in energy consumption during working hours under a 1 °C setpoint temperature offset strategy. Current studies, e.g., [23\u201325], on estimating flexibility from HVAC systems indicate that it is dependent on various physical (e.g., thermal mass, insulation, and architectural layout) and nonphysical parameters (e.g., occupant behaviour and comfort requirements). Also, a building\u2019s ability to provide energy flexibility is influenced by its building system technologies (such as HVAC and thermal storage equipment) and control systems that enable user interactions (i.e., the option to respond and react to external signals such as electricity price or CO2 emission factors) [23]. Therefore, the available energy flexibility depends on the type of building, the types of energy services in the building, the control possibilities, the climate, and the time of day, week, month, and year [28]. To date, different energy flexibility indicators (FIs) proposed by [11,29\u201338] offer estimating energy flexibility considering different input and output parameters. As a result, each of the literature reports on a specific aspect of energy flexibility. For example, Reynders, et al. [11] characterised energy flexibility from the context of Active Demand Response (ADR) and used three performance indicators/characteristics, e.g., available structural storage capacity, storage efficiency, and power shifting capability, to define ADR characteristics. Similarly, Fischer, et al. [29] investigated the flexibility of a heat pump pool and proposed parameters, such as maximum and mean power, shiftable energy, duration, and regeneration time, for characterising energy flexibility. Table 1 summarises these works in terms of the energy flexibility related parameters and key performance indicators (KPIs) used to characterize energy flexibility potential, their sources, the particular region studied, and the DR strategies employed. According to Jensen, et al. [24], the main aspects of energy flexibility can be defined by five terms, e.g., capacity, temporality, efficiency, cost, and direction. Although the quantification methodologies identified in different studies placed emphasis on different aspects of energy flexibility, there are three common traits across energy flexibility studies: i) the time over which energy/power can be shifted/shed, ii) the amount of energy that can be shifted/shed, iii) the associated cost or peak load reduction at the building level that results from activating this flexibility. To combine different aspects, system identification is needed to estimate the full dynamics of energy flexibility. While these characterisation methods are useful in quantifying demand flexibility, they are static functions and will have limited use in estimating flexibility availability from buildings whose flexibility availability could vary continually, for example, in response to a market price signal. Static approaches provide insights into the physical flexibility capabilities of any energy system. However, they cannot be used to directly link the change in demand flexibility due to an external stimulus, such as a continually varying price signal. Moreover, many parameters interact; for example, it does not matter how large the flexibility capacity measured in power is if it can only be activated for an infinitely small amount of time. Similarly, no matter how much flexibility capacity measured in energy is available, it does not matter if it takes an infinitely long time to activate it. By combining each of these measures, the overall flexibility can be measured in terms of cost savings. To fill the gap of a holistic Key Performance Indicator (KPI) integrating all aspects of energy flexibility, IEA EBC Annex 67 [12] proposed a common methodology to characterize the energy flexibility available in buildings. The methodology considers not only the technical aspects or services on a building level but also the interaction with the energy system, occupants and other boundary conditions (e.g., renewable availability, weather conditions). The core of this methodology is a flexibility function (FF) proposed by Junker, et al. [39], which is based on the assumption that energy flexible buildings can adjust their demand in response to incentive or penalty signals imposed by the grid over time. The FF enables characterising energy flexibility through the step response. While this study recognizes that the relationship between the penalty signal and the response (change in demand) should be described using a dynamic function, for easy interpretation, this relation was considered to be linear and time-invariant. However, the linearity assumption limits its application in the real system since the flexibility response of buildings is not proportional to the magnitude of price. Moreover, the flexibility of a building varies due to the impact of forcing factors, such as ambient conditions, internal/solar heat gains, and occupant behaviour. So, in continuation of previous work, Junker et al. 2020 [40] proposed a nonlinear dynamic model of energy flexibility based on Stochastic Differential Equations (SDE), preserving the intuitive flexibility characteristics noted in [39]. The underlying assumption of the model is that, at a certain time, the activated energy flexibility of a price responsive energy system is described by the price and state of charge at that time. The state of charge quantifies the potential of building structural thermal energy storage under dynamic forcing factors, also known as boundary conditions. As seen in Table 1, most of the studies related to understanding flexibility from buildings is focussed on heating systems and evaluated flexibility in the context of meeting heating needs. The price-responsive flexible behaviour of a cooling system differs from that of a heating system in numerous ways. While maintaining the lowest comfort bound (low heating air temperature setpoint) is beneficial for a heating system from the perspective of demand reduction, preserving the highest comfort bound (high cooling air temperature setpoint) leads to a decrease in demand for a cooling system. Therefore, a variable heating setpoint lower than the baseline offers a heating demand reduction. On the other hand, a variable cooling setpoint lower than the baseline leads to increased cooling demand. As a result, the charging and discharging behaviour of the building thermal mass will show the inverted situation for a cooling system compared to a heating system. Also, different Air Handling Unit (AHU) operating strategies, such as economiser mode, where outdoor air is used to reduce energy use, are different between heating and cooling scenarios. Therefore, there is a need to investigate energy flexibility opportunities in cooling dominant buildings where a large diurnal temperature range is observed, resulting in significant cooling load during the operational periods. Although utilisation of the FF to study the response of a heating dominated building has been considered, suitability of this approach for a cooling dominated building has not been investigated before. In addition, this study uses a transfer function to convert variation in price changes to cooling setpoint changes. Details of the FF are described in section 3.1, and this function has been customised for the cooling case study. 1.2 Research objectives In the context of the research gaps identified in the previous section, this study sets the following objectives: \u2022 Study energy flexibility characteristic of a typical office building operating under cooling dominated climate conditions under various HVAC operating states. \u2022 Study the flexible response of the building to varying price signals. \u2022 Evaluate the utilisation of the FF to study the flexible response of the building. Contrary to previous studies on price responsive behaviour of the building (e.g., [40]) that have utilised an Economic Model Predictive Controller (E-MPC) to obtain response to the price signal, this study considers using a direct price signal-based approach, which is simpler to implement in real life scenarios. Rest of the document is organised as follows. The methodology used for creating price responsive behaviour of the building and the building models are described in section 2. Section 3 provides an overview of the flexibility characterisation models used in the analysis. The simulation results are detailed in section 4. Concluding remarks and future research paths are outlined in Section 5. 2 Methodology This study uses a representative office building located in Brisbane, Australia. To represent a typical office building, a prototype building model was developed using EnergyPlus [41] following the National Construction Code (NCC) of Australia [42] and used as a virtual testbed for evaluating energy flexibility. The model was calibrated with energy meter data [43] and used to estimate state-wide aggregate DR potential as functions of time of the day and ambient temperature in a previous study [35]. The use of a calibrated building model enables comparing the response of the building with a baseline scenario. To study the response of the building to input price signals, this study uses five-minute interval spot price data of National Electricity Market (NEM) in Australia [33]. It is assumed that the building indoor temperature setpoints change automatically in response to spot prices within the comfort band. Thus, continually variable price signal information elicits continually varying demand of the building via temperature set point adjustments (Fig. 1 ). Hourly simulations were carried out in Energyplus using typical meteorological year (TMY) weather data. Weather files have hourly or sub-hourly data for each of the essential elements needed during the calculations (i.e., dry-bulb Temperature, dew-point temperature, relative Humidity, barometric pressure, direct normal radiation, diffuse horizontal radiation, total and opaque sky cover, wind direction, wind speed), as well as some auxiliary data such as rain or snow that assist in certain calculational aspects. Baseline demand was generated using a flat 21 °C temperature setpoint. The demand data represents the total electricity data in each time step comprising cooling electricity, plug load, and lighting. Note that minimal electricity will be consumed from the heating system (e.g., supply pumps and fans) in the heating season since a gas-fired boiler has been considered in the heating system. The 5-minute interval continuously varying temperature setpoint data was loaded into the model to carry out simulations for a 24/7 availability of cooling systems in the simulated office building and generate continuously varying electricity demand (observed demand) data. Observed demand will be higher or lower than the baseline demand based on the cooling temperature setpoint compared to the baseline setpoint and the prevailing ambient conditions. Difference between the observed and baseline demand data and changing setpoint data of the same time-step, were used to characterise energy flexibility using a virtual thermal storage modelling approach. The observed flexible and baseline demand data, together with price signals of the same time-step, were used as inputs to the Flexibility Function to estimate the parameters. The parameter values, along with the functions detailed in Section 3.1, were used to study the flexible response of the case study building. The functions were used to parameterise the effect of price and state of charge on demand. 2.1 Conversion of price data to setpoint changes Considering GTA based strategies are simple methods to elicit flexibility from buildings, temperature set point changes have been obtained from spot price variations. Cooling temperature set points in the building are adjusted according to the spot price. Historical 5-min interval spot price data of one-month period (January 2022) is used here to generate cooling temperature setpoint data of the same time-step. The rule is described below (Fig. 2 ): For u ≤ $ 5 , T c l g - s e t = 20 ° C For $ 5 < u ≤ $ 500 , T c l g - s e t linearly interpolates between 20 °C and 24 °C. For $ 500 < u ≤ $ 800 , T c l g - s e t = 25 ° C Otherwise, T c l g - s e t = 26 ° C . This is the case when u > $ 800 . Where, u denotes the spot price data of National Electricity Market in Australia and T c l g - s e t indicates the cooling setpoint. This study considers January the hottest month for the representative city (Brisbane) of QLD, Australia, to trial run the representative office building for continuously varying DR events. Fig. 3 illustrates cooling temperature setpoint changes in response to price changes for two consecutive days of January month. The spot price data has been normalised between 0 and 1 to ease notation. 2.2 Building and HVAC model details The representative office building is a ten-story 6,003 m2 gross floor area (6,000 m2 net lettable area) building comprising ten zones (Fig. 4 ). The construction and glazing component applied in this building in accordance with AS/NZS 4859.2 [44] is listed in Table 2 and Table 3 . The Energy Efficiency provisions in the National Construction Code (NCC) of Australia [42] was used as a reference to construct the baseline representative office building. Note that office buildings are referenced in the NCC as Class 5 buildings. As detailed in Table 4 , the central portion of the ten-storey office building represents general office spaces and meeting rooms and is divided into ten separate zones located on different levels. The canteen space is located on level 1, with a higher occupancy density than adjacent zones. There is a circulation area (e.g., corridors and stairways) adjacent to each office space where internal heat gains from lights and electrical equipment are comparatively low. The HVAC system in the office building encompasses an air loop, chilled water loop, condenser loop, and hot water loop. Each of these loops incorporates multiple HVAC components as listed below: - Air loop: Variable Air Volume (VAV) based AHU with heating and cooling coils, and fans. - Chilled water plant loop: one chiller and a supply pump - Condenser loop: one cooling tower and a supply pump - Hot water loop: one gas-fired boiler and a supply pump More details about this building, operation parameters and HVAC system configurations can be found in Afroz, et al. [35]. 2.3 Building operational details The building is located in Brisbane, Australia, representing the National Construction Code (NCC) climate zone 2 [42]. The building HVAC systems operate 24/7 to maintain a baseline cooling setpoint of 21 °C throughout January. The comfort band is set to 20 to 26 °C for the flexibility studies. In the case study building, an airside economiser cycle is incorporated to leverage free cooling when outside air is favourable (≤25 °C). During the free cooling period (State 1 according to Table 5 ), the outside air and return air dampers are modulated to achieve a mixing air temperature maintained at the supply air temperature setpoint. Therefore, the fan power changes during this period. The chiller system remains deactivated if the outside air temperature (OAT) is lower or equal to the cooling air temperature setpoint. However, the outdoor air damper position becomes 100 % open if OAT exceeds the cooling setpoint but remains lower or equal to the return air temperature assumed to be 25 °C (State 2 according to Table 5). Under this circumstance, both mechanical and economiser cooling is activated. Therefore, due to the effect of modulation of outside air and return air dampers maintaining different opening positions compared to baseline conditions, as well as changed chiller electrical demand, different flexibility characteristics could be observed during the free cooling or economizer cooling period. On the other hand, in the absence of economiser/free cooling mode, which is the case when outdoor temperature is above the return air temperature, the minimum outdoor air (OA) damper position is maintained, and the chiller system remain activated to meet the cooling demand (State 3 according to Table 5). 3 Flexibility characterisation of the case study building This study focuses on the flexibility available from the thermal mass of the building fabric. Similar to an electric storage system, the building can be charged to store more thermal energy and this energy can be discharged to reduce the demand. Considering the building thermal mass as a virtual battery, the state of charge and the change in demand can be expressed as below. This model describes how the state of charge of an energy flexible system varies with change in demand. (1) ∫ d X t = 1 / C ∫ Y t - B t d t Where d X t indicates the change in state of charge over time. The Y t and B t values represent the observed and baseline demand data, respectively. The C value is an estimate of the total amount of energy available for flexibility and expressed in kWh. Thus, in our case, a large C value indicates that a lot of the thermal mass is available for energy flexibility. The state of charge increases whenever flexible demand is higher than the baseline demand and decreases when flexible demand is lower than the baseline demand. Here, the baseline demand is the response of the building under normal operating conditions. It is assumed a constant average price representing a 21 °C flat temperature setpoint leads to baseline demand, B t at time t, while a variable temperature setpoint adjusted according to continuously varying real-world price signals generates flexible demand, Y t . Fig. 5 presents an illustrative example of how the change in demand impacts the rate of change of the state of charge, dXt/dt. Here, the undersupply region indicates that during that time period (from 00 hrs to 05:50 hrs), the flexible demand due to the influence of continuously variable price signals is lower than the baseline demand. As a result, the system remains in discharging mode during that period. On the other hand, the surplus region indicates that during that period (from 05:50 hrs to 08:55 hrs), flexible demand is higher than the baseline demand because of the influence of low electricity prices. As a result, the system moves to charging mode during this period from its discharging condition. However, the change in state of charge represents the relative value, which indicates the difference in state of charge between the current time-step, t and the previous time-step, t-1. Hence, at around 08:30 hrs, even though flexible demand value is slightly higher than the baseline demand, the change in state of charge plummets since the rate at which state of charge increases at 08:30 hrs is lower than that of 08:25 hrs. The dXt/dt value is calculated from the change in demand at each time step and normalised between 0 and 1. 3.1 Flexibility function for characterising energy flexibility In this section, the methodology used for utilising the FF for this case study is described. A quick recap of FF related equations is provided before presenting a step-by-step approach used in this study. Flexibility characterisation introduced by Junker, et al. [40] consists of the following equations: (2) d X t = 1 C ∗ D t - B t d t + X t 1 - X t σ X d W t (3) δ t = l f X t ; α + g u t ; β ; k (4) D t = B t + δ t Δ ( I δ t > 0 1 - B t + I δ t < 0 B t ) (5) Y t = D t + σ Y ∊ t where the variables are presented in Table 6 and have been normalised to be between 0 and 1, W is a Wiener process and ∊ k N 0 , 1 2 i.i.d. ∀ k ∈ N . I is the indicator function, which is equal to 1 when the input is true and equal to 0 when the input is false. This model assumes that energy demand will respond to price change and model parameters C ∗ , Δ , k , α , β , σ X and σ Y together with the functions l , f and g (Table 7 ) characterise the energy flexibility of a price-controlled system. The first term of equation (2) is the same as in equation (1), i.e., it represents the change in demand as the state of charge, whereas the second term ensures that the state of charge does not leave the interval 0 , 1 . The change in state of charge is not only associated with the expected demand but a stochastic term. Equation (3) links demand to state of charge, X and price, u since the underlying assumption of this model is that the energy demand of a flexible energy system can be described by the price and state of charge. f and g are nonlinear functions estimated from data to model the effect of state of charge and price, respectively. They are assumed to be monotonously decreasing from 1 to −1 for values between 0 and 1. The interaction effect of state of charge and price on demand is then modelled by a scaled logistic function for inputs f + g , which is monotonically increasing to map inputs to the interval - 1 , 1 . For example, when state of charge and price are both at the maximum, f 1 + g 1 = - 2 and mapping it to - 1 , 1 , it is expected to be the maximum negative value of δ t . When the stored energy reaches its maximum capacity and the price is high, the demand is limited to as much as possible. On the other hand, when state of charge and price are both at the minimum, f 0 + g 0 = 2 , the demand is increased as much as possible. Equation (4) provides the predicted demand, D t (model output) due to flexible operation of the building. Δ is the proportion of the overall demand that is flexible and it is a parameter between 0 and 1. When δ t > 0 , i.e., the demand is expected to increase and the maximum flexible demand is 1 - B t and the proportion of flexible demand estimated from data is Δ , which means the modification based on baseline is Δ 1 - B t . When δ t < 0 , the maximum flexible demand is baseline itself, and therefore the modification based on baseline is Δ B t . The last equation (Eq. (5) is the observation equation, which quantifies the difference between the observed demand, Y t and the predicted demand, D t due to measurement errors and unexpected behaviour from the energy flexible system. It is used to formulate the objective function that is minimised for the parameter estimation. The difference between the observed demand and the predicted demand represents the difference between the FF model output and the actual operation of the building. Further details about the general formulation of the model are given in [40]. Fig. 6 shows the step-by-step approach used in this study to evaluate energy flexibility from the case study building operational data using the FF. An R program based code of FF made available via IEA Annex 82 [46] has been modified for this study. The modelling process starts with loading the input dataset and defining observation and simulation timesteps, tuning parameters, number of observations, length of time-series, baseload, maximum load and normalised load. As noted in the flow chart, the FF model involves two main steps: 1) Parameterise the effect of price and state of charge expressed as g(u) and f(X) functions, respectively. While the price signal, u is an input to this model and g as a function of u is parameterised by a linear combination of I-splines [47]. The state of charge, x , is an internal variable. The f as a function of x is parameterised from the estimated values of parameters (e.g., α 1 , α 2 , α 3 , a n d α 4 ) . Details about how these two functions (e.g., g(u) and f(X)) are derived can be found in [40]. 2) An objective function to be minimised is formulated. While the optimization starts with initial parameter values, in each iteration those values are updated to ensure maximum likelihood estimate based on minimising the weighted squared residuals (µ and σ 2 ) . Therefore, the parameter values obtained from the optimisation solution contain the least amount of weighted squared residuals. Next, the predicted demand versus the observed and baseline demands are plotted to evaluate model predictive performance. Also, the parametric functional relationships between state of charge, price and demand are plotted as f(X) and g(u) functions. Finally, the maximum energy flexibility capacity and flexibility efficiency of the system are estimated from the model. 4 Results and discussion 4.1 Investigation of demand changes due to continuously varying setpoint changes The energy flexibility behaviour of the building over the course of two days to temperature setpoint changes are shown in Fig. 7 . The light blue shaded area has been used to split free cooling (outdoor temperature ≤ 25 °C) operational periods from proportional minimum (outdoor temperature > 25 °C) operational periods of AHU. The proportional minimum indicates that the minimum outdoor airflow rate varies in proportion to the total system air flow rate. On the other hand, the economizer included to provide free cooling by increasing the flow of outdoor air into the AHU mixing box is activated when the outdoor temperature is lower or equal to 25 °C. The increase in cooling temperature setpoint from the baseline (≈21 °C) triggers a decrease in cooling electricity demand (Fig. 7). Similarly, a setpoint lower than the baseline leads to increased cooling electricity consumption. The cooling equipment, the only flexible equipment considered in the study, is responsible for providing price-responsive flexible demand. However, the cooling energy consumption is dependent on the operating mode of the building. During the free cooling or economiser cooling period, both outdoor and return air fans and the chiller system are responsible for changing the demand profile if the outdoor air temperature exceeds the cooling temperature setpoint but remain lower than the free cooling upper limit activation temperature. However, a minimum outside air damper position is maintained when free cooling mode is not activated. Therefore, in the absence of a free cooling mode, the flexible demand deviates from the baseline due to the changes in chiller system demand only. During the free cooling period (when the outdoor temperature is below the return air temperature), a temperature setpoint triggered by a price signal slightly lower than the baseline does not increase the chiller and fan electricity demand from the baseline. As a result, the flexible demand profile coincides with the baseline demand from 12 am to 7:00 am on 30 Jan (marked 1 in Fig. 7). A further decrease in variable setpoint from the baseline between 7:00 am and 8:00 am (marked 2) brings changes in flexible demand because of economiser and mechanical cooling (State 2 see Table 5). Free cooling again activates at 11:50 pm on 30 Jan and ends at 7:00 am the following day. An increase in setpoint from 5:05 am to 5:50 am on 31 Jan (marked 4 in Fig. 7) lowers the cooling electricity demand during that period (State 2 see Table 5). The system again operates in free cooling mode from 6:40 pm onwards. From 6:40 pm to 8 pm on 31 Jan (marked 5 in Fig. 7) outside temperature was lower than the variable temperature setpoint. Therefore, during this period, chiller system was switched off for variable temperature setpoint conditions and outside air and return air dampers are modulated to achieve a mixed air temperature maintained at the supply air temperature setpoint (State 1 in Table 5). Conversely, both economiser (100 % OA damper opening) and mechanical cooling are activated for the baseline condition as the outdoor air temperature was higher than the baseline temperature setpoint but lower than the return air temperature of 25 °C (State 2 in Table 5). Hence, flexible demand reduces during this period compared to baseline demand. In the absence of free cooling mode, e.g., from 5:05 pm to 6:55 pm on 30 Jan (marked 3 in Fig. 7), a gradual increase in temperature setpoint triggered by price signals leads to negative changes in demand with respect to the baseline, and the electricity rebound effect starts at 6:55 pm once the setpoint starts falling sharply from the peak value (State 3 in Table 5). The flexible demand becomes lower than or equal to the baseline from around 5:00 pm to the end of the day (marked 6 in Fig. 7) due to the fluctuation of setpoint temperatures. However, the demand-changing behaviour is different when the system is in free cooling mode. In summary, the energy flexibility behaviour of the case study building depends on the operating state of the HVAC systems and price signal. While operating in the non-free cooling mode (state 3 in Table 5), only the mechanical cooling systems are responsible for variability in energy flexibility, flexibility during free cooling modes depends upon the outdoor temperature and the indoor temperature set point. For outdoor air temperatures lower than the cooling setpoint in the free cooling mode (State 1 in Table 5), variations in fan power between the baseline and flexible demand conditions are responsible for providing energy flexibility. On the other hand, when outdoor air is favourable (≤25 °C) to start the economiser cycle but cannot achieve the mixing air temperature at the supply air temperature setpoint by only circulating the outdoor air, both mechanical and economiser cooling remain active during that period to meet the cooling demand at the supply air temperature setpoint (State 3 in Table 5). These operational states may not be the same during baseline and flexible operational periods since the set point during a flexible operational period varies based on the price signal. Hence, estimating flexibility during such scenarios is a complex exercise. Fig. 8 illustrates how flexible energy changes ( Y t - B t ) during different HVAC operational modes. For instance, from 12 am to 7:00 am on 30 January, the free cooling mode was activated for both baseline and flexible demand conditions since the outdoor temperature was below 25 °C but above the baseline and variable cooing setpoints (Fig. 7). As a result, 100 % OA was circulated into the building reducing the load of mechanical cooling equipment (State 2 see Table 5). Immediately after that, indoor air temperature reduces by 0.5 °C due to the modulation of temperature setpoint. Thus, demand increases by 40 kW to meet the sudden increase in cooling load from 7:00 am to 8 am. Similarly, a reduction in demand due to less cooling requirement triggered by the temperature setpoint changes increases indoor temperature by up to 2.5 °C between 6:00 pm and 10 pm on 30 January and 3.5 °C between 2:00 pm and 11:55 pm on 31 January. The highest fluctuation in the indoor air temperature (≈3.5 °C) is observed at 6:35 pm on 31 January and it takes around 3 hrs to reach its peak from its initial value (≈0.35 °C). Again, it takes around 3.5 hrs to drop the indoor air temperature from its peak ΔT value to 0.42 °C. It may be noted that these changes in indoor air temperature in 6.5 hrs are still within the acceptable limits of ASHRAE Standard 55-2017 1 1 According to ASHRAE Standard 55\u20132017, the monotonic, noncyclic changes in operative temperature and cyclic variations with a period of 3 hrs should not change more than 3.3°C (4.0°F). [48] in terms of occupants\u2019 thermal comfort conditions. In the absence of free cooling, the demand changes positively for a very small increase in indoor temperature (<0.3 °C) from its baseline condition. This energy flexibility behaviour is observed from 8 am to 5 pm on 30 January and from around 7:30 am to 2 pm on 31 January. This is because the temperature setpoint is still lower than the baseline during this period (see Fig. 7). To gather more insights into the energy flexibility behaviour of the study building in terms of thermal storage capacity, state of charge information was obtained using building thermal mass. The volumetric heat capacity of the internal wall (kJ/m3-°C), its total area (m2), and thickness (m) and the change in set point (°C) details were used to estimate the thermal energy stored in the building internal fabric due to change in indoor conditions. Fig. 9 shows the status of state of charge corresponding to demand changes in each time step for a 48-hour time span (30\u201331 January). This is an example of dropping the state of charge from 100 % to 85 % due to the influence of demand reduction several times in 48-hour time spans. This figure shows that the negative value of Yt − Bt contributes toward discharging the stored energy. Similarly, the positive value of Yt − Bt contributes toward charging the system. The change in state of charge happens due to demand changes and impacts the charging/discharging status of the system. For example, a reduction in demand from 5:20 pm to 6:50 pm on 30 January triggered by a rapid increase in temperature setpoint to 26 °C (see Fig. 7) led the system going to discharging mode from its charging condition.In other words, a high spot price value directed the system going to discharging mode (see Fig. 10 ). A further decrease in demand from 5:10 am to 5:45 am and 4:50 pm to 8:20 pm on 31 January due to increased spot prices led the system to discharging mode again, reducing the instantaneous charging condition of the system. 4.2 Flexibility function model performance Results obtained using FF are discussed in this section. The predicted demand of the office building obtained from the FF model is compared against the observed and baseline demand in Fig. 11 . The difference between the baseline and observed demand is due to the response of the building HVAC system to spot price changes via cooling temperature setpoint changes, as shown in the figure. As detailed in Section 4.1, the sharp spikes in the observed demand are the reflection of energy flexibility behaviour of the case study building, which depends on the operating state of the HVAC systems and price signal. Predicted demand refers to estimated demand using FF. This figure shows that predictions capture the variable demand profile quite well, except for the sharp spikes created mostly due to rapid fluctuation in temperature setpoint. Model behaviour during free cooling operation could be improved as well. While the FF attempts to model the nonlinear response of the building and its associated HVAC systems with a dynamic model of the building with a single capacitance, there are several time constants associated with zone air and structural building materials, which are lumped into a single value by the FF characterisation. Therefore, during times of rapid price changes, the model cannot capture the flexible behaviour very well. Furthermore, the flexible behaviour prompted by different operating states of the AHUs may require additional input parameters that explain them to capture that properly. Hence, these aspects require further investigation. 4.3 Flexibility function parameter estimates To provide insights into how prices and stored energy affect demand, the functional relationship between price and demand changes is modelled by the nonlinear function g, while the effect of state of charge is modelled by f. In Fig. 12 , the x-axis represents the energy price and state of charge, which has been normalised between 0 and 1. The y-axis describes the change in demand due to flexibility, where −1 and 1 mean the maximum decrease and increase in demand. Since the demand is non-negative and cannot surpass the maximum demand, the potential increase in demand is scaled by the difference between baseline and maximum demand. Similarly, decreased demand is scaled by baseline demand. Here, the maximum demand implies the upper bound on how much power the system can consume at any given time when the cooling system, as well as other end-use equipment, such as lighting and electrical equipment, run at full load. Similarly, there is a minimum or base load when all flexible components are switched off or run at minimum loads. This figure shows that when the electricity price, u, is between 0.15 and 1.0, there is a close to linear relationship between price and demand changes, which means that it adjusts demand proportionally to the price. The building seems to be indifferent to the changes in price as long as it remains between 0.1 and 0.15, while dropping the price further, which results in almost surely turning demand up. The time-series data of price and demand are shown in Fig. 13 for two different 48-hrs time spans. The red circled area in Fig. 13 (a) also shows that a small change in price value leads to a significant change in demand when the u value is between 0 and 0.1 compared to the u value between 0.1 and 1.0. Note that the u value between 0 and 0.1 indicates that the cooling setpoint in variable condition is lower than the baseline condition (≈21 °C) (see Fig. 3). As the cooling setpoint approaches 20 °C, which means when the u value approaches 0, a slight reduction in cooling setpoint leads to a significant increase in demand. The functional relationship between energy demand and state of charge is expressed by f ( X ) (Fig. 12). For 0.18 ≤ X ≤ 0.6, which implies that when the building thermal mass stores between 18 % and 60 % of its maximum storage capacity, which may vary in time with boundary conditions, there is a close to linear relationship between demand changes and state of charge. When the state of charge is between 0.6 and 0.8 (60 % to 80 % of maximum storage capacity), it has almost no effect on demand changes. As the state of charge approaches boundaries (close to 0 or 1), a small change in state of charge leads to a substantial change in demand. This implies that when X = 0, the building thermal mass does not hold any stored energy. Intrinsically, at this stage it is unable to reduce demand. However, when the building thermal mass starts storing energy from its empty condition it invokes extra electricity demand resulting in electricity demand spike. Thus, significant change in demand occurs when the state of charge is between 0 and 18 %. Similarly, when the state of charge approaches its maximum storage capacity, demand starts reducing significantly. The maximum energy flexibility capacity of a building can be estimated as (6) M a x i m u m e n e r g y f l e x i b i l i t y c a p a c i t y = C ∗ ∗ ( M a x p o w e r - M i n p o w e r ) where the maximum load implies the maximum power, the system can consume at any given time when the cooling system and other end-use equipment such as lighting and electrical equipment run at full load. Similarly, there is a minimum or base load when all flexible components are turned off/run at minimum load. Note that the only flexible component considered in this study is the cooling system. For this case study, the estimated maximum energy flexibility capacity is 7248.2 kWh over one month. The maximum and minimum demand were observed to be 250.5 kW and 457.2 kW. Model parameters for this case study are shown in Table 8 . The α1 value lower than 0 indicates that f function will intersect the x-axis for smaller values of x (<0.5), which is apparent in Fig. 12, while Δ =1.0 suggests that the flexibility function estimates all of the cooling load to be flexible. X0 = 0.73 indicates that the state of charge was estimated to be at 73 % during the start of the simulation. The rest of the parameters have no direct interpretation. 4.4 Cost and energy savings analysis For the case study building as shown in Table 9 , the energy flexibility brings in actual savings of 13 %, accounting for a saving of 3564.23 AUD in one month, while it was expected to save around 12 % according to FF model prediction. In contrast, energy consumption increased by 1.80 % in one month, although it was expected to increase by 2.06 % according to FF model prediction results. Note that this study considers a flat electricity price rate for the baseline scenario, assuming that it has no influence on electricity demand while the observed and predicted energy consumption represents the variable spot price scenario of the Australian Electricity Market. It is seen that the response of the building to variable price signals not only yields flexible demand but also benefits the building delivering cost savings. 5 Concluding remarks Energy flexibility characteristics of a cooling dominated building have been studied. This study employed a direct price signal-based approach to evaluate the price-responsive flexibility of an office building, which is simpler to implement in real-life scenarios. A first-order virtual battery model of the building and flexibility function methods have been used in this study to understand the flexible demand behaviour of the building in the cooing season to varying price signals. The price signals, which induced changes in HVAC set points, offered flexible demand. This study provides valuable insights into the energy flexibility characteristic of the building and its association with its thermal inertia and energy storage capacity. This study also observes different flexibility response characteristics for different AHU operational modes (e.g., proportional minimum and free cooling). The practical implications of this study's findings are significant. According to the FF model, demand increases significantly for prices equal to or below 10 % of the highest recorded spot price data, representing close to the lowest comfort band (≈20 °C) considered in this study. The change in demand is adjusted proportionally to the price for prices above 15 % of the highest recorded spot price data. The functional relationship between state of charge and demand changes shows that f intersects the x-axis at around 0.3, meaning that the building structural system usually holds 30 % of full charge when the price does not make any changes to demand. The maximum energy flexibility capacity from the cooling system for the studied one-month period is 7248.2 kWh. The response of the building to variable price signals yields flexible demand, delivering cost savings of 13 %. The FF fits the variable demand data reasonably well, except for the sharp spikes that the FF underestimated. Therefore, further investigation is required to upgrade the model so that the influence of different cooling strategies on the demand profile can be captured more precisely. One possible way could be expanding the FF approach to two states (resistance and capacitance) to better reflect building thermal mass dynamics as well as its interaction with boundary conditions. Also, this study can be expanded in future to characterise aggregate energy flexibility from clusters of buildings under various boundary conditions (e.g., climate, occupants, HVAC operation and control). While this study provides various useful insights there is potential for further research as listed below: While a continually varying price signal (5-min interval spot price) has been used in this study to demonstrate its suitability to elicit energy flexibility from HVAC systems in buildings, constructing an appropriate price signal that will deliver the required flexibility is a research exercise in itself and is outside the scope of this work. This will require consideration of many factors such as occupant comfort, building operator willingness, building recovery period between previous flexible events to name a few. This study uses a simple dynamic FF-based energy flexibility characterisation approach in the context of the same comfort constraints (20 \u2013 26 °C) throughout the day to elicit flexible responses as feedback to variable price signals via temperature setpoint changes. While this approach has been successfully applied for a cooling scenario, there is room for further improvement to this model, which may be capable of identifying different flexibility characteristics during occupied and unoccupied periods. An extended version of this study could consider a forecast of electricity prices, outside temperature and occupancy used in a high-fidelity control model to identify optimal setpoint trajectories that could be delivered to the building. Such optimisation studies could yield interesting insights.

        "dc:description": "Flexibility in buildings is a low-cost alternative to support the electricity network with high penetration of variable generation. There is a limited understanding of energy flexible behaviour of the buildings in response to electricity market signals. In this paper, the price-responsive flexible behaviour of a commercial building with a cooling system has been studied. A first-order virtual battery model of the building and flexibility function-based approach have been used to understand the flexible behaviour of the building to varying price signals. The price signals delivered changes in building electricity demand profile, altering cooling temperature set points. The building structural thermal storage capacity was found to vary depending on demand changes. Low price signals provoke positive demand changes with respect to the baseline demand, taking the system to charging mode. Similarly, high price signals lead the system to discharging mode, reducing the instantaneous charging condition of the system. HVAC operating states, e.g., free cooling/economiser cooling and mechanical cooling, have been found to have a notable impact on electricity demand flexibility. The flexibility function shows that for a very low-price value, the cooling setpoint approaches the lowest comfort bound, and demand increases significantly. A deviation between the maximum and minimum electricity demand of 207 kW for the studied building system gives an estimated maximum energy flexibility capacity of 7248.2 kWh. The response of the building to variable price signals yields flexible demand, delivering cost savings of 13 %.",
