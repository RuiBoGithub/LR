Graphical abstract Air handling units have been widely adopted in modern buildings for indoor air regulation and circulation tasks. The accurate and reliable fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) of air handling units (AHU) are of great significance to maintain indoor environment while ensuring the energy efficiency in building operations. Data-driven FDD approaches have gained great popularity due to their excellence and flexibilities for practical applications. Given sufficient labeled data, existing studies have validated the value of various supervised learning algorithms for FDD tasks. However, it can be very challenging, expensive, time-consuming and labor-intensive to obtain data labels for faulty operations, making it impractical to fully realize the potential of advanced supervised learning algorithms. To tackle this problem, this study proposes a novel semi-supervised FDD method using neural networks. The method adopts the self-training strategy for semi-supervised learning and has been tested for two practical applications, i.e., fault diagnosis and unseen fault detection. A number of data experiments have been conducted to statistically characterize the influence of key learning parameters, including the labeled data availabilities, the maximum semi-supervised learning iterations, the threshold and learning rate for pseudo-label data utilization. The results indicate that the method can effectively enhance model generalization performance by utilizing large amounts of unlabeled data. The insights obtained are helpful for developing advanced data-driven tools for smart building system fault detection and diagnosis. Keywords Semi-supervised learning Air handling units Fault detection and diagnosis Artificial neural networks Machine learning 1 Introduction Among various building services systems, the heating, ventilating and air-conditioning (HVAC) system typically has the largest energy saving potential considering the intrinsic complexity of system optimizations and wide existence of operating faults. It is estimated that up to 30% energy savings can be achieved through the use of advanced building automation technologies [1]. As an example, air handling units (AHUs) have been widely employed in modern buildings for indoor air regulation and circulation tasks. There are three general AHU faults, i.e., equipment faults, actuator faults and sensor faults [2,3]. Equipment faults refer to malfunctions in system operations, such as air leakage in ducts and cooling coil fouling. Actuator faults typically lead to deviations in system outputs, e.g., the outdoor air volume will become non-adjustable if the outdoor air damper is stuck due to actuator faults. Sensor faults may lead to drifts and offsets in data measurements and thereby, imposing negative impacts on system feedback controls. In practice, the accurate and reliable fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) of AHUs are of great significance to maintain indoor environment while ensuring the energy efficiency in building operations. Existing studies have proposed three main approaches for detecting and diagnosing faults in AHU operations, i.e., rule-based, physical model-based, and data-driven approaches. The rule-based approach mainly relies on engineering experiences to define a set of rules or thresholds for applications. Schein et al. develop 28 expert rules for AHU fault detection and diagnosis [4]. The method was computationally efficient and could be easily applied using commonly available measurements in building automation systems. Yang et al. developed a set of expert rules for detecting and isolating temperature sensor faults in AHUs [5]. The method was reported to be effective in different AHU operating modes. The rule-based approach is easy to use and has relatively high transparency. However, the fault diagnosis performance may not be satisfactory as expert rules are often simplified. The physical model-based approach relies on physical principles to develop prediction models, based on which residuals or differences between actual and predicted values are utilized for FDD [6,7]. The reliable development of physical models typically requires detailed information on building physics and therefore, can be costly and time-consuming for practical applications. By contrast, data-driven methods are of high flexibilities and have obtained encouraging results thanks to the advance in data analytics [8]. Previous studies have utilized unsupervised learning techniques, such as association rule mining [9,10], principal component analysis [11\u201313], clustering analysis [14,15] and unsupervised deep autoencoders [16], to explore the intrinsic data characteristics for FDD. Unsupervised learning is especially useful when there is no labels or ground truths on whether a data sample represents normal or faulty operations. However, greater research efforts should be made for result post-mining and performance evaluation. The other solution relies on supervised learning techniques to develop prediction models for AHU fault detection and diagnosis. Given sufficient data, a number of statistical and machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regressions [17], autoregressive models [18] neural networks [19,20], support vector machines [21,22], decision trees [23,24] and ensemble models [25,26], have been used to perform regression, binary or multi-class classification tasks. Compared with rule-based and physical model-based methods, data-driven methods are easy to use and very promising for large-scale applications [27]. Existing studies have shown that data-driven models, especially variations of neural networks such as deep neural networks [28,29], recurrent neural networks [30], generative adversarial networks [31] and unsupervised deep learning [32], can achieve very high accuracy in detecting and diagnosing typical faults in AHU operations. Nevertheless, the practical applicability of data-driven FDD models may be limited due to the lack of labeled data. On the one hand, faulty operations may only occur for short periods of time, making them only accountable for small proportions in building data sets. On the other hand, individual buildings may only possess measurements on certain faults, making it very difficult to maintain model performance on new or unseen faults. More importantly, it can be very difficult to obtain the actual label for each data sample, i.e., whether it corresponds to a certain faulty or normal operation. Manual inspections and high-level domain expertise are required for data labeling, making it very expensive and time-consuming for practical applications. In practice, individual buildings may have large amounts of operational data, yet only a small subset has actual labels for data-driven model development. As a result, it is theoretically unjustified to develop advanced machine learning models due to the notorious overfitting problem. Semi-supervised learning can be applied to enhance the reliability of data-driven models with the help of large amounts of unlabeled data. It has been successfully used in various industries, such as detecting bearing faults in the mechanical industry [33,34], identifying anomalies in chemical engineering [35], and predicting defects in software engineering [36]. Only few studies have been conducted to address this topic in the building field. Yan et al. proposed a semi-supervised learning framework for diagnosing typical AHU faults [37]. A number of machine learning models, such as the support vector machines, k-nearest neighbors, random forests, have been developed in a semi-supervised manner. The results validated the value of semi-supervised learning in AHU fault detection and diagnosis. Considering the rapid development in deep learning communities, it is very promising to develop semi-supervised neural networks for achieving reliable, accurate and automated AHU fault detection and diagnosis. At present, there is a lack of studies to address the research gap between semi-supervised neural networks and AHU FDD tasks. Therefore, this study proposes a novel semi-supervised learning approach to developing neural network models for AHU fault detection and diagnosis. The contribution of this paper is summarized as follows. This study investigates the value of semi-supervised neural networks for AHU fault detection and diagnosis. A self-labeled strategy has been developed to ensure the flexibility in practice. The methodology has been tested in two typical FDD scenarios. The first assumes that building professionals have collected limited and labeled data on all faulty operations, while the second aims to detect unseen faulty operations with the help of unlabeled data. A series of data experiments have been designed to statistically characterize the performance of semi-supervised neural networks given different learning parameters. The results can provide practical guidelines in developing semi-supervised neural networks for FDD tasks. The insights obtained are helpful for utilizing large amounts of unlabeled data and enhancing reliability of advanced data-driven models in the building field. The paper is organized as follows. Theoretical background on semi-supervised learning is introduced in Section 2. The research methodology is described in Section 3. The research results are presented and discussed in Section 4. Conclusions are drawn in Section 5. 2 Theoretical background 2.1 Basics on semi-supervised learning Semi-supervised learning falls halfway between supervised and unsupervised learning. The main idea of semi-supervised classification is to develop reliable models using smaller amounts of labeled data and larger amounts of unlabeled data. It is especially useful when there are far more unlabeled data than labeled, which is likely to happen if data collection is cheap and convenient, yet obtaining data labels is time-consuming, expensive or labor-intensive. Semi-supervised learning has gained great success in the fields of Web mining, text mining, bioinformatics and mechanical engineering [38,39]. As a formal definition, the data set X consists of three parts. The first is X l = { x 1 , x 2 , ⋯ , x l } , which stands for data with labels of Y l = { y 1 , y 2 , ⋯ , y l } . The second is unlabeled data X u = { x l + 1 , x l + 2 , ⋯ , x n } . These two parts are both available during the semi-supervised training process. The third part is X test = { x n + 1 , x n + 2 , ⋯ , x n + m } , which is not available during the training process and only used for performance evaluation. The goal of semi-supervised learning is to develop accurate and robust prediction models to predict labels for Xtest given labeled data (Xl , Yl ) and unlabeled data Xu . As shown in Fig. 1 , the use of unlabeled data can be beneficial for enhancing the model generalization performance, as the modified decision boundary will become more reliable and robust considering distributions of unlabeled data (i.e., denoted as grey circles). There are four main approaches for semi-supervised classifications, i.e., generative model-based, low-density separation-based, graph-based and self-labeled approaches [40,41]. There is no direct answer on which performs the better, as their performance is closely related to underlying data assumptions. For instance, the generative model-based approach assumes that the unlabeled data follow predefined parametric models, while the low-density separation-based method assumes that the underlying decision boundary only lies in low-density regions. The graph-based approach treats the semi-supervised classification problem as a graph min-cut problem, where each node represents a data sample and edges are created based on data similarities [41]. By contrast, the self-labeled approach is more intuitive and convenient to use. It has gained the greatest popularity as it imposes less stringent assumptions on data distributions and does not require extensive modifications on supervised learning algorithms [42]. 2.2 An overview of self-labeled semi-supervised strategies There are two main strategies for self-labeled semi-supervised learning, i.e., self-training and co-training [41]. The self-training strategy adopts an iterative training scheme. The main idea is to enlarge the labeled data by assigning pseudo labels for unlabeled data, based on which prediction models are fine-tuned to achieve better generalization performance. As shown in Fig. 2 , an initial model is firstly developed based on labeled data and applied to unlabeled data to generate pseudo labels. The labeled and pseudo-labeled data are then combined to update or modify the prediction model. The training process iterates until a certain stopping criterion is met, e.g., reaching the maximum iteration. Co-training assumes that there are two conditionally independent data views (e.g., one as image data and the other as text data), each has the capability of making correct classifications. In such a case, two prediction models are developed and used for mutual updates. The self-training strategy is more suitable for FDD tasks considering its great compatibility with building operational data and supervised learning algorithms. To ensure the performance of self-training, one has to properly address two key issues. The first is how to generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled data, while the second is how to utilize pseudo-labels to prediction model updates or modifications. With the rapid development in deep learning communities, artificial neural networks have become very powerful for predictive modeling due to the rich in model architectures, training schemes and problem adaptabilities [2,3]. Previous studies have shown the power of semi-supervised neural networks in various fields [43,44]. Nevertheless, few studies have been conducted to in the building field. This study aims to investigate the value of semi-supervised neural networks for FDD tasks. The method adopts the self-training strategy and the impacts of different learning parameters are evaluated given different data experiment settings. The details are provided in the following sections. 3 Research methodology 3.1 The semi-supervised neural network-based method for FDD As shown in Fig. 3 , the method adopts the self-training strategy for semi-supervised FDD. The main idea is to enlarge the limited labeled data with pseudo-labeled data, based on which the prediction model is updated or modified for better generalization performance. The prediction model can be developed using different types of neural networks (i.e., fully connected, convolutional or recurrent neural networks). The model can be applied for both binary and multi-class classifications by varying output neuron numbers. In this study, the SoftMax activation function is adopted at the output layer. As a result, the values of output neurons sum up to one and can be used to represent class probabilities. More specifically, the method has three key learning parameters. The first is the threshold, which specifies the minimum class probability or confidence score for pseudo-label generation. It can be used to control the quality and amounts of pseudo-labels for model updates. Intuitively, the threshold should be set larger than 0.5 to ensure the quality of pseudo-labeled data. For instance, if the threshold is set as 0.7, only predictions with scores larger than 0.7 will be used as pseudo-labels for next-round model updates. In practice, it can be very challenging to determine the optimal threshold due to its contradicting impacts on semi-supervised learning, i.e., a larger threshold may select more trustworthy pseudo-labels while reducing the efficiency in unlabeled data utilization. In this study, different thresholds will be used to quantify its impacts on semi-supervised fault detection and diagnosis. The second is the learning rate for pseudo-label data utilization. It is defined as a value between zero and one. The larger the learning rate is, the more dependent the model update is towards pseudo-labeled data. In this study, the learning rate is used together with the model outputs as sample weights for next-round model updates. For instance, given a learning rate of 0.5, if the model predicts an unlabeled data sample as class A with a score of 0.8, the sample weight used for the next-round model updates will be 0.5 × 0.8 = 0.4 . The third is the semi-supervised learning iteration, which specifies the maximum number of model updates using pseudo-labeled data. It is worth mentioning that other stopping criteria can be used to control the semi-supervised learning process. In this study, to quantify the impact of iterations on semi-supervised learning, the learning process continues until it reaches the maximum iteration. 3.2 Experiment data descriptions The air-handling unit (AHU) operational data collected from the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) research project RP-1312 have been adopted for data experiments [45]. The original data were collected in three testing periods, i.e., the summer of 2007, the spring and winter of 2008, each lasting for two to three weeks. AHU operational variables, ranging from temperature, humidity to equipment status, have been collected on two identical air handling units at one-minute collection interval. Typical AHU faults were manually introduced during operations, such as duct leakage, damper stuck, valve stuck. Condition-based ground truths have been provided as labels for classification model development. A more detailed description on ASHRAE RP-1312 can be found in [45]. In this study, five main fault types have been selected together with normal operations for data experiments. As shown in Table 1 , each main fault consists of three severity levels, making it in essence a 16-class (i.e., 15 faulty and 1 normal operating conditions) classification problem for fault diagnosis. 3.3 Experiment setups As shown in Fig. 4 , the performance of semi-supervised neural network-based method has been tested for two practical tasks, i.e., fault diagnosis and unseen fault detection. The first is fault diagnosis, which in essence is a 16-class classification task aiming to classify whether a data sample corresponds to a certain faulty or normal operation. The second is unseen fault detection, which in essence is a binary classification task aiming to successfully identify unseen faulty operations. These two tasks address the common need of building professionals and are of great value for practical applications. 3.3.1 Experiment setups for the fault diagnosis task The experiment setups for the fault diagnosis task are as follows. Firstly, the experimental data are partitioned into two sets, i.e., existing and testing data, with proportions of 70% and 30% respectively. Semi-supervised neural networks are developed using existing data and the generalization performance is evaluated using the testing data. Secondly, eight different labeled data availabilities have been assumed, i.e., 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 and 80 labeled data per class. Considering that the fault diagnosis task consists of 16-class, 160, 320, 480, 640, 800, 960, 1120 and 1280 data samples are selected from existing data as labeled data for initial model development. To tackle the overfitting problem, the labeled data are further divided into training and validation data with an equal proportion of 50%. The rest of the existing data are assumed to be unlabeled. As summarized in Table 2 , different thresholds (i.e., 0.6, 0.7, 0.8 and 0.9) and learning rates (i.e., 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4) have been used to quantify their impacts on semi-supervised fault detection and diagnosis. The maximum iteration number for semi-supervised learning is set as five. 3.3.2 Experiment setups for the unseen fault detection task As shown in Table 3 , experiment setups for the unseen fault detection task are similar except for the way of generating labeled data. In this study, one particular fault, i.e., the exhaust air damper being fully open, is assumed to be missing in labeled data and the goal of semi-supervised learning is to enhance the detection rate of such fault in testing data. To cope with the labeled data amounts used in previous experiments, 160, 320, 480, 640, 800, 960, 1120 and 1280 labeled data are sampled from existing data, whose labels have been changed into 0 (i.e., normal operations) or 1 (i.e., faulty operations) before data sampling. The labeled data are assumed to be balanced, i.e., each of the two labels has the same data amounts. Data samples corresponding to the unseen faults are not included in the labeled data but presents in the remaining unlabeled data. The performance of semi-supervised learning is evaluated based on the detection rate of the unseen faults in testing data. 3.3.3 Classification model configurations Previous studies have been conducted to investigate the importance of different input variables for AHU fault detection and diagnosis [46,47]. A number of statistical and machine learning methods can be applied to perform customized input feature selection for different supervised learning algorithms, e.g., the filter- and wrapper-based methods [48,49]. To make the result comparable with existing research communities, 15 variables were manually selected as input variables for predictive modeling, i.e., the supplied air temperature, returned air temperature, outdoor air temperature, mixed air temperature, status and speed of supply and return fans, valve positions of chilled and hot water, differential pressures of supply and return fans, and the damper positions for exhaust air, return air, outdoor air. The steady-state data with 2-minute interval have been adopted for analysis. The numeric characteristics of input variables are summarized in Table 4 . Considering that input variables may have different scales, data standardization has been performed to regulate input variables into similar ranges for predictive modeling, i.e., x i ' = x i - x - sd ( x ) , where x - is the mean value, sd(x) is the standard deviation, x and x ' represent the original and standardized data respectively. The architecture of semi-supervised neural network has been fixed for performance comparisons. A three-layer architecture with 50 hidden neurons has been adopted considering the limited amount of labeled data. The Rectified Linear Unit is used as the activation function at the hidden layer. A dropout of 0.3 is applied for model regularization. The output layer has 16 neurons for fault diagnosis and 2 neurons for unseen fault detection. The activation function used at the output layer is SoftMax. An early-stopping training scheme has been adopted to avoid the overfitting problem using labeled validation data. To evaluate the value of semi-supervised learning in fault detection and diagnosis, a benchmark model with the same architecture will be developed based on the limited labeled data alone. The value of semi-supervised learning can therefore be evaluated by comparing classification accuracies between semi-supervised models and benchmark models. All the data analysis has been conducted using the R programming language [50]. 4 Results and discussions 4.1 Semi-supervised learning for fault diagnosis 4.1.1 Fault diagnosis performance using semi-supervised neural networks Fig. 5 presents the fault diagnosis performance using different settings for semi-supervised learning. In general, there is an increasing trend between the number of labeled data and the fault diagnosis accuracy. This is expected as the larger the amount of labeled data, the more reliable the model generalization performance is. At the early stage, dramatic increases in fault diagnosis accuracy can be observed with the increase in the number of labeled data per class. The fault diagnosis accuracy will become saturated when the number of labeled data per class reaches a certain critical value. In such a case, the utilization of unlabeled data will not further enhance the generalization performance. In practice, such critical value is desired to be as small as possible considering that costs and feasibilities in collecting labeled data. The results indicate that such critical value is affected by both thresholds and learning rates for pseudo-label data utilization. More specifically, the learning rate should be always kept at relatively low levels (e.g., 0.1 or 0.2) to avoid instabilities in model generalization performance. The rationale behind is the pseudo labels generated may not be trustworthy and therefore, the model development process should not be dominated by large amounts of pseudo-label data. In essence, the threshold for pseudo-label data selection has contradicting effects on semi-supervised learning performance. On the one hand, a larger threshold can filter out untrustworthy pseudo labels, which helps to stabilize the model training process. On the other hand, a smaller threshold will select more pseudo-labels for semi-supervised learning, making it more efficient in unlabeled data utilization. For instance, when learning rate is 0.1 and threshold is 0.6, the model performance becomes saturated when the number of labeled data is 30. By contrast, the number of labeled data is around 50 when the learning rate is still 0.1 but the threshold increases to 0.9. 4.1.2 General impacts of semi-supervised learning parameters on fault diagnosis A multiple linear regression model, which have relatively high interpretabilities, has been developed as an initial attempt to quantitatively assess the general impacts of learning parameters on semi-supervised learning. It should be mentioned that multiple linear regressions may not accurately describe nonlinear relationships between inputs and outputs. Such model is only used for initial interpretations. Considering that the four network-based semi-supervised learning parameters have different data scales, max\u2013min normalization was adopted for scale transformation. The output variable is the performance improvement ratio (i.e., PIR), which is an evaluation metric defined to quantify the value of semi-supervised learning in fault diagnosis. It is defined as PIR = Accuracy semi - Accuracy bench Accuracy bench , where Accuracysemi and Accuracybench refer to the fault diagnosis accuracies of semi-supervised models and benchmark models respectively. A positive PIR indicates that semi-supervised learning is useful and vice versa. The resulting model is summarized in Table 5 . In general, the signs of model coefficients are in accordance expectations. It indicates that semi-supervised learning iterations have positive impacts on PIRs. This is expected as the increase in semi-supervised learning iterations can better utilize the value of unlabeled data and therefore, resulting in higher PIRs. The coefficient of the learning rate of pseudo-label data is negative, indicating that semi-supervised learning typically benefits from smaller learning rates. It is in accordance with expectations as model development should not be heavily dependent on pseudo-label data. The threshold of pseudo-label has a relatively small positive coefficient, suggesting that the model performance benefits from setting higher thresholds. It should be mentioned that the associated P-value is larger than commonly used significant level (e.g., 0.01 or 0.05), indicating that such variable is statistically insignificant given the current model configurations. In addition, the coefficient for the number of labeled data is positive, which is counter-intuitive considering that semi-supervised learning should be more useful given limited labeled data. As we shall illustrate in the following sections, such results mainly stem from nonlinear relationships between PIRs and the number of labeled data. 4.1.3 The impact of learning rates on semi-supervised fault diagnosis Fig. 6 presents the averaged impacts of different learning rates on performance improvement ratios given different labeled data availabilities. Taking the smallest learning rate (i.e., 0.1) as example, the averaged PIR is −4% when the number of labeled data per class is 10. The averaged PIR then increases to approximately 26% and gradually decreases to 5% with the increase in labeled data amounts. The averaged PIRs are summarized in Table 6 . The other three learning rates present similar upward and downward trends. One noticeable difference is that the higher the learning rate is, the more labeled data are needed to benefit from utilizing pseudo-label data. More specifically, the number of labeled data per class should be at least 30, 40 and 50 to make PIRs to be statistically higher than zero when the learning rates are 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 respectively. The results suggest that smaller learning rates should be used for semi-supervised neural network learning. 4.1.4 The impact of thresholds on semi-supervised fault diagnosis The relationship between thresholds used for pseudo-label data selection and averaged PIR is shown in Fig. 7 and the actual values are presented in Table 7 . In general, the smallest threshold (i.e., 0.6) results in the largest PIR when the number of labeled data per class is between 20 and 50. It indicates that once the initial model developed by labeled data has adequate capabilities in generating pseudo labels, smaller thresholds should be used to better realize the value of unlabeled data for performance improvement. When the number of labeled data per class is very limited (i.e., 10), the initial model may not produce reliable pseudo labels. In such a case, the largest threshold (i.e., 0.9) should be adopted as a more conservative approach for semi-supervised learning. The value of semi-supervised learning decreases when the number of labeled data per class further increases from 40. Unlike learning rate, there is no universal threshold suggestion given different numbers of labeled data. On the one hand, a smaller threshold can better realize the potential of unlabeled data. On the other hand, a smaller threshold may introduce more unreliable pseudo labels for model updates, resulting in worse generalization performance for fault diagnosis. 4.1.5 The impact of iterations on semi-supervised fault diagnosis In this study, the maximum iteration number was set as five for each data experiment. The impacts of iterations on averaged PIRs given different numbers of labeled data are summarized in Table 8 . It is observed that the performance of semi-supervised learning is rather unsteady when the number of labeled data is less than 30. The rationale behind is that the initial model does not have sufficient capabilities in producing useful pseudo labels. As shown in Fig. 8 , an example is presented when the learning rate and threshold for pseudo-label data are set as 0.1 and 0.8 respectively. When the number of labeled data per class is ten, PIRs can be negative at the first few iterations and stay positive after the fourth iteration. The PIRs stay positive for all other cases. More specifically, the PIR differences between successive training iterations are more significant when the number of labeled data per class is small, e.g., 20 and 30. By contrast, such differences are not significant when the number of labeled data is relatively large, even though slightly increasing trends can be observed with the increase in training iterations. 4.2 Semi-supervised learning for unseen fault detection 4.2.1 Unseen fault detection using semi-supervised neural networks Experiments have been conducted to investigate the performance of semi-supervised learning in detecting unseen faults. The prediction task is in essence a binary classification problem, i.e., whether the operating conditions are faulty or not. In this study, one particular fault, i.e., the exhaust air damper being stuck with fully open position, is assumed to be absent from labeled training data. The initial classification model is developed based on normal and faulty data with actual labels. The numbers of labeled data are set to cope with settings used in previous experiments. For instance, the smallest number of labeled training data is 160, which corresponds to 10 data samples per class used in previous experiments. The model is then updated based on unlabeled data in a semi-supervised manner. It should be noted that the absent faulty operations only exist in unlabeled data. The value of semi-supervised learning is evaluated based on the improvements of unseen fault detection rates in the testing data. The unseen fault detection rates under different semi-supervised learning settings are shown in Fig. 9 . It is observed that the unseen fault detection rate typically decreases with the increase in the number of labeled data. Given sufficient labeled data, the initial model developed will have excellent capabilities to distinguish between normal and known faults. Consequently, the model will classify all absent faulty operations into normal operations and therefore, the unseen fault detection rates will become zero. In general, unseen fault detection rates are higher when learning rates are set with higher values. When the number of labeled data is relatively small (i.e., less than 480), higher unseen fault detection rates can be achieved using a threshold of 0.9. As the number of labeled data increases, smaller thresholds may result in slightly better detection rates. 4.2.2 General impacts of semi-supervised learning parameters on unseen fault detection Similar to Section 4.1.2, a multiple linear regression model has been developed as an initial attempt to quantitatively assess the impacts of different semi-supervised learning parameters on the improvements of unseen fault detection rate. The improvement of unseen fault detection rate is defined as the difference of unseen fault detection rates between semi-supervised and benchmark models. A positive value indicates that semi-supervised learning and vice versa. A shown in Table 9 , all parameters are statistically significant given a significant level of 0.05. The results indicate that increases in the number of labeled data and thresholds have negative impacts on performance enhancement. The other two parameters, i.e., learning rate and semi-supervised learning iteration, have positive impacts on improving the unseen fault detection rate. 4.2.3 The impact of learning rates on semi-supervised unseen fault detection The impact of learning rates on improvements of unseen fault detection rates is shown in Fig. 10 . The actual values are summarized in Table 10 . An obvious trend can be observed that larger learning rates typically result in larger improvements in unseen fault detection rate. The differences in performance improvements are relatively small when the number of labeled data is relatively small (i.e., less than 480). The optimal learning rate is 0.4 when the number of labeled data are no less than 480 and the order in performance improvements stay the same. Unlike previous experiments on semi-supervised fault diagnosis, smaller learning rates will result in worse performance, especially when the number of labeled data are relatively large. The results suggest that larger learning rates should be used to enhance unseen fault detection rates. In such a case, the fault detection model will rely more on unlabeled data with potentially unseen faults and thereby enhancing unseen fault detection rate. 4.2.4 The impact of thresholds on semi-supervised unseen fault detection As shown in Fig. 11 and Table 11 , the threshold generally presents negative impacts on enhancing unseen fault detection rate, especially when the number of labeled data is larger than 480. It should be mentioned that given smaller numbers of labeled data, the best performance is obtained when using the largest threshold (i.e. 0.9). One possible explanation is that the impacts of other parameters, such as the learning rate, are more dominant and thereby, masking the impact of thresholds given certain parameter combinations. 4.2.5 The impact of iterations on semi-supervised unseen fault detection Fig. 12 and Table 12 are shown to illustrate the average impact of iterations on improvements of unseen fault detection rate. In general, the semi-supervised learning approach has a decreasing trend in the improvement of unseen fault detection rate with increases in the number of labeled data. One interesting finding is that the larger the amount of labeled data is, the larger the optimal iteration is for semi-supervised learning. For instance, given the smallest number of labeled data, the largest improvement of unseen fault detection rate is obtained at the second iteration. The optimal iteration is three when the number of labeled data is 320 or 480, and increases to four given 640 or 800 labeled data. The optimal iteration becomes five with further increases in labeled data amounts, indicating that more iterations are needed to achieve the largest possible improvements of unseen fault detection rate. 4.3 Discussions Conventional approaches for developing data-driven fault detection and diagnosis models typically require large amounts of labeled data. In practice, the collection of data labels can be very time-consuming and sometimes not even feasible. It is therefore of high practical value to develop semi-supervised approaches to fully utilize the large amount of unlabeled data for model development. This study investigates the performance of semi-supervised neural networks in two practical tasks, i.e., fault diagnosis and unseen fault detection. The former assumes that building professionals have collected labeled data on all faulty operations, while the latter is applicable to detect unseen faulty operations with the help of unlabeled data. To provide guidelines for practical applications, the impacts of key learning parameters (i.e., the learning rate, threshold and iteration) have been quantified through data experiments. The mainly findings are shown as below: (1) Considering the fault diagnosis task, the value of semi-supervised learning reaches maximums when the number of labeled data per fault class is 40 and gradually decreases with the increase in labeled data amounts. Negative effects have been observed when there are too few labeled data to start with, making the initial classification model too weak to generate useful pseudo-labels for semi-supervised learning. The learning rate has the most significant impact and should be kept as smaller values to ensure the semi-supervised fault diagnosis performance. (2) Considering the unseen fault detection task, the value of semi-supervised learning decreases with the increase in labeled data amounts. This is expected as the larger the labeled data amount, the more confined the classification model becomes, making it less likely to detect unseen faults. The results suggest that the learning rate has the largest impacts and should be kept as larger values to enhance the unseen fault detection rate. In other words, the useful information in detecting unseen faults are hidden in unlabeled data and therefore, larger learning rates should be adopted to enhance the capability of initial models in detecting unseen faulty operations. Despite of the rapid development in building automation systems, data shortage (i.e., either due to the lack of data samples, variables or labels) is still one of the main obstacles in fully realizing the potential of advanced data analytics for individual buildings. Future studies may focus on the integration among advanced data analytics (e.g., generative modeling and transfer learning [51,52]) for enhancing the practical value of data-driven fault detection and diagnosis models. 5 Conclusions The wide adoption of building information technologies has provided massive amounts of operational data for automated and smart building operation management. It is very promising to apply powerful machine learning techniques for developing reliable and accurate data-driven models for building system fault detection and diagnosis. Nevertheless, building operational data are typically collected with no ground truths or labels, making them less useful for conventional machine learning. To tackle such challenge, this study proposes a semi-supervised learning approach for building system fault detection and diagnosis. A novel semi-supervised neural network-based method has been developed for the effective and efficient utilization of building operational data. Two sets of data experiments have been conducted to statistically characterize the impacts of key semi-supervised learning parameters (i.e., the learning rate, threshold and iteration) on identifying typical faults in air-handling units. The results indicate that the proposed semi-supervised learning method can fully utilize unlabeled data for building system fault detection and diagnosis. Firstly, the method can be used to achieve satisfactory performance for fault diagnosis given limited labeled data. Secondly, the method can be used to enhance the detection rate of unseen fault. Practical suggestions have been obtained for practical applications. The research outcomes can be used to develop advanced data-driven tools for analyzing and utilizing massive building operational data.

        "dc:description": "Air handling units have been widely adopted in modern buildings for indoor air regulation and circulation tasks. The accurate and reliable fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) of air handling units (AHU) are of great significance to maintain indoor environment while ensuring the energy efficiency in building operations. Data-driven FDD approaches have gained great popularity due to their excellence and flexibilities for practical applications. Given sufficient labeled data, existing studies have validated the value of various supervised learning algorithms for FDD tasks. However, it can be very challenging, expensive, time-consuming and labor-intensive to obtain data labels for faulty operations, making it impractical to fully realize the potential of advanced supervised learning algorithms. To tackle this problem, this study proposes a novel semi-supervised FDD method using neural networks. The method adopts the self-training strategy for semi-supervised learning and has been tested for two practical applications, i.e., fault diagnosis and unseen fault detection. A number of data experiments have been conducted to statistically characterize the influence of key learning parameters, including the labeled data availabilities, the maximum semi-supervised learning iterations, the threshold and learning rate for pseudo-label data utilization. The results indicate that the method can effectively enhance model generalization performance by utilizing large amounts of unlabeled data. The insights obtained are helpful for developing advanced data-driven tools for smart building system fault detection and diagnosis.",
