Graphical abstract Research studies provided evidence on the energy efficiency of integrating personal thermal comfort profiles into the control loop of Heating, Ventilation, and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) systems (i.e., comfort-driven control). However, some conflicting cases with increased energy consumption were also reported. Addressing the limited and focused nature of those demonstrations, in this study, we have presented a comprehensive assessment of the energy efficiency implications of comfort-driven control to (i) understand the impact of a wide range of contextual factors and their combinatorial effect and (ii) identify the operational conditions that benefit from personal comfort integration. In doing so, we have proposed an agent-based modeling framework, coupled with EnergyPlus simulations. We considered five potentially influential parameters and their combinatorial arrangements including occupants\u2019 thermal comfort characteristics, diverse multi-occupancy scenarios, number of occupants in thermal zones, control strategies, and climate. We identified the most influencing factor to be the variations across occupants\u2019 thermal comfort characteristics - reflected in probabilistic models of personal thermal comfort - followed by the number of occupants that share a thermal zone, and the control strategy in driving the collective setpoint in a zone. In thermal zones, shared by fewer than six occupants, we observed potentials for average energy efficiency gain in a range between −3.5% and 21.4% from comfort-driven control. Accounting for a wide range of personal comfort profiles and number of occupants, the average (±standard deviation) energy savings for a single zone and multiple zones were in ranges of [−3.7 ± 4.8%, 5.3 ± 5.6%] and [−3.1 ± 4.9%, 9.1 ± 5.1%], respectively. Across all multi-occupancy scenarios, a range between 0.0% and 96.0% of combinations resulted in energy savings. Keywords HVAC Operation Personal Thermal Comfort Model Energy Efficiency Load Flexibility Agent-based Modeling Thermal comfort sensitivity Multi-occupnacy 1 Introduction Comfort-driven control of Heating, Ventilation, and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) systems, which accounts for feedback from personal thermal comfort models or profiles in the control loop, has gained attention as one of the advanced control techniques for higher energy efficiency. Across different studies on the effectiveness of comfort-driven HVAC control, a median value of 20% of energy saving potentials has been reported [1]. The energy saving outcome could be affected by several contextual factors, such as individual thermal comfort characteristics, the number of occupants in a thermal zone, the configuration of thermal zones, the control strategy, and climate. Although previous studies have investigated energy efficiency, these studies have commonly focused on control framework development and looked at a limited number of factors and contextual conditions. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the effect and potentials of comfort-driven control has not been presented in prior studies to provide an insight into its efficacy under different contextual circumstances. When it comes to energy use, shifting a temperature setpoint (hereinafter a setpoint) according to users\u2019 preferences does not guarantee energy saving. For example, the use of comfort-driven HVAC control has brought about increases in energy consumption through a field study of single-occupancy spaces [2]. This was associated with the occupants\u2019 thermal preferences that required additional conditioning load, compared to the use of conventional setpoints. Another similar example can be found in the study by Aryal and Becerik-Gerber [3], which evaluated the energy implication of the comfort-driven HVAC control in multiple climate zones at different building scales through simulation. They have shown different levels of energy savings \u2013 an average of 2.1% of energy reduction compared to a fixed building level setpoint of 22.5 °C and 6.1% of energy increase, compared to the Department of Energy (DOE) reference setpoint of 24.0 °C. Therefore, understanding the impact of diversity in personal thermal comfort profiles is critical in identifying the energy efficiency bounds of comfort-driven control. Furthermore, as observed in our literature assessment [1], the majority of the studies on comfort-driven HVAC control have considered the warm Mediterranean climate, where cooling is the dominant conditioning mode for most of the year. In other words, due to the prevalence of overcooling in this climate, energy saving could potentially be seen when applying comfort-driven HVAC control. In addition, the selection of a specific comfort-driven HVAC control strategy (i.e., the method for integrating personal thermal comfort models into the control loop) can play a part in the observed performance of the HVAC systems. Previous studies have proposed different methods for combining personal comfort feedback into a collective control signal. Jazizadeh et al. [4] showed that minimization of personal comfort deviation (from ambient temperature) could result in improved energy efficiency and Ghahramani et al. [5] further demonstrated that additional energy saving could be achieved by also accounting for energy use aspect in a multi-objective optimization process. However, in the latter study, they have shown increased energy use by 7.3% in one thermal zone (due to occupants\u2019 preferences), while the other zones had additional reduction in energy use by −18.8% and −32.3%. In other words, studies have shown that the implementation of different comfort-driven control strategies could lead to diverse results based on contextual conditions. Different studies have proposed a diverse set of comfort-driven control strategies including accounting for majority vote [6], error minimization [4], multi-objective optimization of energy and comfort [5], and personal thermal comfort sensitivity [7,8]. These strategies could result in different outcomes in terms of energy use and comfort satisfaction depending on the contextual conditions. Moreover, the impact of thermal zone scale on comfort-driven HVAC control is a less explored factor. When it comes to occupancy-driven HVAC control, another major modality of Human-In-The-Loop (HITL) HVAC control [1], studies have demonstrated the benefits of having multiple thermal zones, rather than a single thermal zone, to adapt to the sporadic dynamics of occupancy [9,10]. However, according to our extensive literature analyses [1], the impact of occupancy density in thermal zones and the resolution of thermal zones (i.e., the number of thermal zones in a building) on the efficiency of comfort-driven control has been rarely investigated. Accordingly, in spite of the valuable demonstrations of potentials by using comfort-driven HVAC control strategies, understanding their energy use implications calls for further investigations. Therefore, we have explored the impact of the aforementioned factors in driving the range of energy efficiency from comfort-driven HVAC control. In doing so, different combinations of these factors have been accounted for in this study to provide a comprehensive assessment of their impacts. Also, it is worth noting that energy implications of a control strategy that we introduced in our previous studies [7,8] have been also explored in this study. This approach improves the collective thermal comfort in a multi-occupancy thermal zone by leveraging thermal comfort sensitivity (i.e., individual responses to temperature variations) compared to the strategies that focus only on occupants\u2019 preferred temperatures. Therefore, through this study, the following research questions have been explored: \u2022 What is the impact of occupant diversity, building, and climate features on the energy use of comfort-driven HVAC control? \u2022 What is the impact of comfort-driven control strategies on energy efficiency? \u2022 What is the probability of energy saving given the diversity in personal comfort preferences? \u2022 For which contextual conditions, the use of personal comfort profiles shows higher efficacy? The first question aimed to investigate the impact of (1) occupants\u2019 thermal-comfort-related features, (2) number of occupants in thermal zones, (3) number of thermal zones in a building, and (4) climate. The second question was investigated to provide insight into the pros and cons of each comfort-driven control strategy from different perspectives of energy efficiency (i.e., energy saving and thermal comfort satisfaction). The third question seeks to identify the energy efficient circumstances given the diversity in thermal comfort preferences and the uncertainty of their combinations during multi-occupancy. Lastly, through the investigations of the first three questions, the fourth question was answered. The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses the research background on advances of comfort-driven HVAC control for energy efficiency enhancement. Section 3 explains the methodology of the study. Specifically, we have elaborated on the Agent-Based Model (ABM) that replicates the mechanism of comfort-driven HVAC control and its use, coupled with an EnergyPlus prototype of an office model developed by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). Section 4 explains the results and findings of the study. Section 5 presents the limitations of this study to provide the ground for further discussions and research. Lastly in Section 6, the conclusion and future directions of this study are provided. 2 Comfort-driven HVAC operation paradigm In conventional control of HVAC systems, thermostats play a central role in acquiring occupants\u2019 feedback in the control logic of HVAC systems. However, their unsuitable locations and unclear authority over the devices often impede Human-Building Interaction (HBI) [11,12]. These circumstances lead to an underwhelming performance of indoor conditioning systems despite their significant role in the total energy consumption of building systems and occupants\u2019 thermal comfort [13]. Several studies have shown that the office occupants, who often face these limitations [11,12], reported lower thermal satisfaction, compared to the residential occupants [12,14]. Therefore, research efforts sought to enable the integration of contextual thermal comfort information into the control of HVAC systems. Starting from web-based surveys [15], which are highly accessible to users, studies have proposed different methods from using mobile devices [16\u201321] to physiological sensing [22\u201324] in order to enhance human-building interactions. These methods have paved the way for collecting individual users\u2019 feedback on the environment in the form of thermal perceptions or preferences as opposed to desired temperature values in the legacy system (as thermostat settings). In this new paradigm, an indoor environment could be evaluated by using the personal thermal comfort models developed by using thermal votes of individual users and other contextual environmental and human-related factors (i.e., personalized thermal comfort profiles or models) [25]. These models could provide information such as the probability distribution of thermal comfort associated with different contextual conditions. The availability of users\u2019 thermal comfort feedback and their personalized profiles has enabled the comfort-driven HVAC control \u2013 that is, a system could adjust the indoor conditions based on actual and individual users\u2019 thermal preferences and sensitivities. Through simulation and field study evaluations, previous studies have shown the elevated performance of comfort-driven HVAC systems [2,4,5,26,27]. These studies have proposed specific strategies and frameworks for integrating the personal comfort models into the control loops and evaluated their performance. The findings show that such a control paradigm not only improves users\u2019 comfort but also prevents over-conditioning beyond their thermal comfort zones. In the course of implementing this strategy, one of the inevitable questions is which setpoint should be chosen in multi-occupancy spaces to achieve collectively comfortable environments. The use of thermal zones (a number of rooms conditioned simultaneously by an HVAC unit) in current buildings reduces the occupancy density in multi-occupancy spaces. Specifically, as the number of thermal zones decreases, addressing the conflict between different occupants could be more challenging. As an example, most of residential buildings are designed as single thermal zones [28]. In these cases, diverse thermal preferences and responses to ambient temperatures from different occupants could complicate the choice of a setpoint [29]. Accordingly, studies have introduced several strategies to generate collectively comfortable conditions as follows: \u2022 Majority rule \u2013 adjusting a setpoint based on the majority vote [6], \u2022 Error minimization \u2013 identifying a setpoint where the total gap (i.e., errors) between setpoints and desired temperatures is minimized [4], \u2022 Collective learning \u2013 updating the PMV model based on collective thermal comfort feedback [26]. \u2022 Thermal-comfort-sensitivity-based optimization \u2013 benefiting from each user\u2019s thermal comfort sensitivity in addition to thermal preferences to find an optimal setpoint [8]. These control strategies were shown to have potentials for improving users\u2019 thermal comfort as well as energy efficiency. In an example study, the majority rule strategy was shown to consume 20% less energy while maintaining users\u2019 thermal comfort, compared to the conventional default setpoint setting [6]. The error minimization strategy was shown to result in 39% reduction in average daily air flow (i.e., energy saving) while keeping the temperature close to users\u2019 thermal preferences [4]. The collective learning strategy, proposed by Erickson and Cerpa [26], not only saved 10.1% of energy but also improved the overall thermal comfort. However, despite the promising results in these studies, each study has used different benchmarks as well as different contexts for their evaluations. Such isolated demonstrations limit our comprehensive understanding of the viability of comfort-driven control strategies. Therefore, as noted, an in-depth understanding of the differences between these strategies calls for further assessment under the same contextual circumstances. In a recent study, Aryal and Becerik-Gerber [30] have shown the energy implications of a comfort-driven strategy. In this study, the setpoint selection was carried out by summing all occupants\u2019 thermal comfort profiles in a thermal zone and selecting the setpoint with the maximum probability, similar to Ghahramani et al. [5]. Nonetheless, the impact of having diverse numbers of occupants (with varied preferences) and thermal zones has not been addressed \u2013 i.e., the full occupancy in each thermal zone was applied in their analyses. Therefore, this study contributes to the understanding of the efficacy of comfort-driven control strategies by (i) investigating the energy efficiency implications derived from diverse comfort-driven HVAC control strategies under different contextual conditions as elaborated above, and (ii) quantifying the energy efficiency bounds given the uncertainty of multi-occupancy scenraios and occupants\u2019 thermal comfort preferences. 3 Methodology 3.1 Overall framework The overall framework of this study is presented in Fig. 1 . In general, the framework is a combination of (1) an Agent-Based Model (ABM) for user interactions with the environment and (2) a building energy use simulation platform (i.e., EnergyPlus [31]). Even though EnergyPlus, developed by the U.S. DOE, is a powerful tool, it has limited capabilities in accounting for occupant behavioral dynamics and characteristics [32\u201335]. Hence, to incorporate individuals\u2019 thermal comfort features and implement comfort-driven HVAC control according to dynamic thermal comfort demands, we have developed the ABM module in the framework. This module enables us to reflect the dynamics of occupants and their interactions with the indoor environment in the form of agents, which have their own objectives, behaviors, and properties. Accordingly, through the use of ABM, a diverse set of scenarios could be created and tested. The specific application of the proposed ABM model, in the context of this study, is the identification of setpoints according to personal thermal comfort models and different comfort-driven control strategies. Then, the setpoint information is fed into the energy simulation environment to assess and quantify the energy implications of comfort-driven HVAC control. As noted, we have identified different parameters that could potentially affect the energy use of building systems. Accordingly, the framework in Fig. 1 depicts the components, the required data, and the flow of the information between different components. In the following subsections, we have described the specifics of each component and the required data. 3.2 Agent-based modeling component 3.2.1 General mechanism The developed ABM replicates the mechanism of comfort-driven HVAC control as reflected in Fig. 2 . This mechanism includes multiple agents, including human, Occupant Voting System (OVS), and HVAC agents that communicate with each other to seek an optimal setpoint that maximizes human agents\u2019 collective thermal comfort. Specifically, human agents report their perceptions about thermal environments as thermal votes to OVS agents, and OVS agents generate individual thermal comfort profiles. Then, the HVAC agent optimizes the setpoint by requesting feedback from OVS agents. The HVAC agent could use alternative control strategies for setpoint optimization. Each thermal zone has agents that interact to derive the operational setpoint of that specific zone independent of other zones. Given the simulation nature of our study, in the ABM simulations, we have assumed that the conditioned air is equally distributed in a space. 3.2.2 Human agents\u2019 thermal vote creation To understand the impact of the diversity in individual preferences and the corresponding uncertainty in driving the energy use, we have created diverse sets of thermal comfort profiles (representing human agents) to be leveraged in various multi-occupancy scenarios. To this end, we have leveraged actual thermal comfort profiles reported by Daum et al. [36] and developed a data-driven process of thermal comfort profiling. This process is composed of three steps as reflected in Fig. 3 . Daum et al. [36], upon a comprehensive field measurement of personal thermal comfort feedback (collecting numerous thermal votes for several months), employed a multinomial logistic regression model to distinguish uncomfortably cool, comfortable, and uncomfortably warm states (blue, black, and red lines in Fig. 3, respectively). Using this approach, they have provided six personal thermal comfort profiles as the outcome of their study. Given that these profiles were developed using a large number of votes and across different days of field measurements, we leveraged these profiles for creating simulated personal comfort profiles, representing a larger number of profiles [7]. To this end, we introduced two random variables to sample from the individual comfort profiles by picking (1) a random temperature within the range from 20 to 30 °C ( T i ) and (2) a thermal vote ( V i ) by selecting a random probability in [0,1] that determines the thermal comfort perception state of the occupant from the distributions (reflected in the details of Fig. 3). Through repeated sampling, we created datasets of ( T i , V i ) pairs for each occupant. In our study, we assumed that each human agent reports 50 thermal votes to the OVS agents (i.e., the OVS system sends the same number of requests to individuals), representing the average number employed for personalized comfort profiles in the previous studies (e.g., [4,37,38]). Depending on user dedication, the number of thermal votes for profile development could vary in reality, but we used the same number of thermal votes to minimize the impact of independent variables in our analyses. Although thermal comfort perception could vary depending on the context [39] (for example across different seasons), given the purpose of the study, we assumed that thermal comfort profiles remain constant. This is a realistic assumption given that we conducted our evaluations for a summer season and used a probabilistic representation for thermal comfort profile learning. 3.2.3 Comfort profiling process by occupant voting system (OVS) agents After compiling thermal votes from human agents (i.e., ( T i , V i ) pairs), the OVS agents proceed with the profiling process using the Bayesian network modeling method in [38]. This method generates a joint probability distribution that identifies the probabilities of being comfortable leveraging reported uncomfortably cool, uncomfortably warm, and comfortable votes. With the normality assumption, the normal distributions of data points for each one of the triple thermal perception vote types, are jointly represented as in Eq. (1): (1) P o c | t = P c | t P u c | t + P c | t + P ( u w | t ) where P ( o c | t ) indicates the probability distribution of the overall comfort for a given temperature, P ( u c | t ) refers to the probability distribution of uncomfortably cool votes, P ( c | t ) is the probability distribution of comfortable votes, and P ( u w | t ) is the probability distribution of uncomfortably warm votes. Each individual probability distribution uses a Gaussian distribution defined by the average and the standard deviation of corresponding temperatures for the votes. Fig. 4 presents an example illustration for creating a personal thermal comfort profile accounting for different classes of thermal comfort perceptions. In other words, this profile shows how this human agent changes its thermal satisfaction with respect to variations in air temperature. More details of this Bayesian network modeling method has been provided in our previous study [7]. After identifying each human agent\u2019s thermal comfort characteristics, such as preferred temperatures (personal comfort zone) or thermal comfort sensitivity, the OVS agent communicates this information to the HVAC agent. Specifically, in each multi-occupancy thermal zone, all OVS agents, representing all human agents in the zone, receive a temperature setpoint from an HVAC agent and explore the comfort profiles of human agents to identify and send their reactions back to the HVAC agent for optimization. The reaction could be in different forms including a thermal vote, an error between the setpoint and the preferred temperature, and the rate of change in satisfaction probability depending on the control strategy. 3.2.4 HVAC agent\u2019s control strategy The HVAC agent utilizes a control strategy to seek an optimal setpoint by communicating with OVS agents with the aim of maximizing human agents\u2019 comfort. Fig. 5 presents the details of this process and its associated steps. Starting from the temperature setback (i.e., a setpoint during vacancy to curtail the conditioning load; hereinafter a setback), the HVAC agent evaluates each operable setpoint utilizing a cost function to determine the setpoint. The cost functions vary depending on the HVAC control strategies \u2013 i.e., the approaches that are used to integrate individual personal comfort models for collective conditioning of a thermal zone. The cost functions are as presented in Table 1 . In this study, the following control strategies were evaluated: (1) using majority thermal votes (majority rule), (2) minimizing collective thermal comfort deviation for a thermal zone (error minimization) (3) thermal-comfort-sensitivity-based optimization The collective learning strategy, described in Section 2, has been excluded as this approach does not account for individuals\u2019 characteristics. Each strategy requires a different type of feedback from OVS agents as shown in Fig. 6 . In the first approach, each OVS agent submits a vote among warmer (+1), no change (0), and cooler (-1) options for a given temperature setpoint. For each potential setpoint, the HVAC agent sums all the thermal votes and proceeds to change the setpoint if the sum has either a positive or negative value. In the second approach, the HVAC agent calculates the sum of the deviations between thermal preferences (i.e., the temperature that provides 100% of satisfaction to a human agent) and each potential setpoint. Then, it selects the setpoint that has the minimum collective error. In the third strategy, the HVAC agent aims to maximize the collective probability of being comfortable for all human agents by comparing each human agent\u2019s thermal comfort sensitivity. Thermal comfort sensitivity measures the probability of thermal satisfaction change by moving from one setpoint to an adjacent one as shown in Fig. 6. This strategy accounts for thermal votes in the first step to check the range of setpoints that results in a neutral feedback from human agents as a group (i.e., sum of votes from all human agents is zero) - where thermal comfort sensitivity comes to play in optimization. Then, it evaluates each human agent\u2019s thermal comfort sensitivity in the range of collective neutral votes to prioritize the human agents with higher sensitivities - i.e., to avoid higher drops in individual comfort due to change in the setpoint. More details and the pseudo code for each control strategy could be found in our previous study [7]. In addition, as shown in [7], having a high-resolution operational setpoint interval (e.g., 0.1 °C) could aid in creating a slightly better collectively acceptable environment, but the impact is marginal. Therefore, we chose 0.5 °C as the operable setpoint interval, which is practical and flexible for users. This ABM for HBI has been used in cooperation with a building energy simulation model, which has been elaborated in the following subsection. 3.3 Energy simulation component 3.3.1 Prototype building model In order to evaluate the energy implications of comfort-driven control for different parameter combinations, the ABM simulates the HBI and passes the information to the energy simulation model. To do so, we have chosen to use the prototype of a small office building developed by Pacific Northwest National Lab (PNNL). This model has the total floor area of 511 m2 in one floor with windows fractions of 24.4% for the south and 19.8% for the other three orientations evenly distributed around the building. The heating type of this model is an air-source heat pump with gas furnace as back up and the cooling type is an air-source heat pump with maximum, and minimum supply air temperature of 40 °C and 13.8 °C, respectively. The major energy source is electricity. Further details of the model are provided in [40]. This model suits our objectives considering that this model (1) covers all 8 U.S. climate zones and (2) has five thermal zones with different sizes and occupancy capacities (as shown and described in Fig. 7 and Table 2 , respectively) and facilitates our analyses for a diverse set of scenarios. Specifically, we could simulate different conditions by changing the number of occupants, the number of thermal zones, and setting the climate conditions. 3.3.2 Control and experimental scenarios As noted, the objective of the study is to assess the impact of the aforementioned five parameters on the performance of comfort-driven control. Hence, we have considered different values for each one of those parameters. Furthermore, a number of other parameters in the analyses were set to be the same (i.e., default parameters) across all the scenarios to facilitate the interpretation of the results and focus on the parameters of the study. The adopted parameters for different scenarios and the method for their calculations are as elaborated below. Default parameters: Table 3 shows the default parameters used in this study. For the period of analyses, the summer season has been chosen. Although the data used for creating the personal thermal comfort models were collected through a longitudinal survey over three years [36], with the assumption that thermal comfort profiles might not vary significantly in a season, we chose the summer season. The setback was set to be at 29.44 °C (i.e., 85°F), which was the initial temperature in the EnergyPlus model by PNNL. Moreover, a uniform occupancy profile was considered for the environment \u2013 full occupancy from 9:00 am to 6:00 pm during weekdays and vacancy during weekends. Thermal comfort profiles: As indicated in Table 2, given the full capacity of the prototype building, we generated sets of 31 human agents with different thermal behaviors using our proposed ABM simulation. With the aim of addressing the impact of having diverse groups of occupants with different thermal comfort characteristics in a building, we have chosen two sets of 31 human agents with distinguishable patterns for our analyses. These two sets represent cases in which most of the occupants in a building prefer a warmer environment or a cooler environment. These representative occupant profiles help us consider the impact of a wide range of occupant diversity in assessing the uncertainty of energy efficiency potentials. More details on this process are presented in Section 4. Climate conditions: In order to account for the impact of varied climate conditions, three locations, with moderate climates, were selected given their different temperature characteristics as shown in Table 4 . We excluded locations with extreme climates. Number of thermal zones: In our simulations, the following (one single zone, as well as three thermal zones) configurations were adopted from the five thermal zones, defined in the PNNL prototype model, as shown in Fig. 8 . By diversifying the number of thermal zones, we have intended to gauge the impact of the thermal zones\u2019 resolution in a building. Using the original five thermal zones results in unnecessarily complicated combinations of human-agents and increased computational time. To this end, we considered thermal zones to be combined by applying the same setpoint for the zones. In case #1, all the zones were considered to act as one unified thermal zone. In case #2, we combined (1) the perimeter left and top zones and (2) the perimeter bottom and right zones to have three zones in total. Number of occupants (i.e., human agents) in case #1: In this case, we have explored how the number of occupants in a single thermal zone (the whole building as one thermal zone) from a wide range of multi-occupancy scenarios will affect the performance of comfort-driven strategies. To explore the impact of having varied numbers of human agents ( k ) with diverse thermal comfort preferences, we considered different combinations of 6, 12, 18, and 24 human agents at a time. However, as reflected in Table 5 , we constrained the total number of human agents ( n t ) to be less than 31 for each k to avoid the utilization of all possible combinations. Increasing the total number of human agents ( n t ) substantially increases the number of combinations ( N c ). For example, selecting groups of 12 human agents among 31 will result in 141,120,525 cases as calculated by using Eq. (2). To this end, the n t , for each k , was manually chosen so that N c is sufficiently low and more than 1000 combinations. However, for statistical analysis, we repeated the selection of combinations for 100 times per each k value to create a wide range of variability. (2) N c = n t ! k ! n t - k ! Number of occupants (i.e., human agents) in case #2: For case #2 in Fig. 8, we used the same total number of human agents in the building but distributed them in three thermal zones. Accordingly, different combinations of human agents were created in each thermal zone, compared to the case #1. This change created much larger number of combinations. Considering all possible combinations of arranging different thermal comfort profiles in adjacent thermal zones would have been computationally expensive while not necessary in answering the questions in this study. Hence, to simplify the approach, the following steps were taken: 1. We randomly sampled the number of human agents (6, 12, 18, and 24) out of the total 31 data sets. 2. The selected human agents were considered to be equally distributed in three thermal zones. Hence, the possible combinations in each thermal zone ( C ( k , k 3 ) ; e.g., C ( 6 , 2 ) or C ( 12 , 4 ) ) were calculated. 3. The previous steps were repeated several times to create sufficiently diverse cases for our analyses (Table 6 has shown the detailed information). The outcome could represent different sets of thermal comfort profiles in shared thermal zones. 4. Then, we acquired optimized setpoints for different comfort-driven control strategies from each set of human agents through the developed ABM. The outcome of this step was sets of the possible combination of setpoints for different combinations of the human agents. In other words, for a group of diverse human agents and for different combinations of multi-occupancy scenarios in each zone, the ranges of possible setpoints were identified. Given three thermal zones and different possible sets of setpoints in each zone, we created different combinations of setpoints in adjacent thermal zones. 5. Through the EnergyPlus simulation, the energy use for different combinations of setpoints in adjacent thermal zones was calculated. As one example combination, 9100 kWh is consumed by having 20.5 °C in thermal zone #1 and #2 and 21.0 °C in thermal zone #3). 6. Since the probability distribution of the selected setpoints in step #4 is calculated for different combinations of human agents (e.g., 20.0 °C \u2013 10%, 21.0 °C \u2013 20%, and 22.0 °C \u2013 30%), we could compute the possibility of a setpoint combination. For example, when all three thermal zones have 20.0 °C as the setpoint, the probability of such a case is 10 % × 10 % × 10 % = 0.1 % . By using these probabilities, the distributions of energy use for all combinations were calculated. 3.4 Comparison with a benchmark: In the evaluations, we set up the benchmark setpoint to be 22.5 °C as it is the commonly used temperature setpoint in the previous studies [3,41] and the conventions in practice. Therefore, the energy consumption difference ( E diff ) is calculated using Eq. (3). (3) E diff = ( E comf - E ben ) E ben × 100 in which E ben is the energy consumption for the benchmark setpoint and E comf is the energy consumption for the comfort-driven control. In calculating the energy saving potentials, the mean value of energy savings for each control strategy was used as E comf . As discussed, comfort-driven control could result in either less or more energy consumption depending on the occupant thermal comfort characteristics, the combinations of occupants in thermal zones, and the outside temperature, compared to the conventional benchmark operation. Given that we are interested in assessing the energy saving potentials and their combinatorial bounds for the comfort-driven control, in presenting the results, we specified the percentages of the cases that result in energy savings compared to the benchmark setpoint (specified by a darker shade in the background to the left of the Benchmark line as shown in Fig. 9 ). In other words, we are presenting a rough estimate of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) value for energy consumption cases that are less than the benchmark energy consumption \u2013 i.e., P ( E comf ≤ E ben ) . In this figure, the bars that are overlapping with the shaded background, represent the possibility of energy saving. 3.5 Energy efficiency of comfort-driven control As energy use in the context of HVAC control is for occupant thermal comfort, energy efficiency should account for the amount of energy use and the level of occupant thermal comfort. Therefore, in addition to the energy consumption assessments, for each control strategy, we have quantified the thermal comfort improvement. Similar to the calculation of energy consumption difference (Eq. (3)), the improvement of thermal comfort ( TC imp ) is calculated as below. (4) TC imp = ( T C comf - TC ben ) TC ben × 100 in which TC ben is the probability of being comfortable using the benchmark setpoint (22.5 °C). Similarly, the T C comf represents the average probability of comfort for each control strategy. Lastly, to demonstrate the overall performance ( O p ) in terms of energy efficiency, we have used the following indicator: (5) O p = TC imp - E diff Given that both metrics are in [0,1], the subtraction of energy difference from comfort improvements will boost the thermal comfort efficiency for reduced energy consumption (i.e., E diff < 0 ). That is, less energy use by the comfort-driven control leads to a negative value and we count such cases as positive. To the contrary, an increase in the energy use penalizes the improvement in thermal comfort gain. 4 Results and findings In running the analyses, as noted, we selected two sets of 31 diverse thermal comfort profiles to represent a wide range of human agents. The rationale behind selecting two sets of profiles was to assure that we account for a wide range of preferred temperatures across a spectrum of possible occupancy scenarios. In doing so, a data-driven approach was adopted to ensure the maximum difference between the thermal comfort profile sets in terms of preferred temperatures. To this end, we created 1000 sets of 31 thermal comfort profiles and the histogram of the mean preferred temperatures of the sets is shown in Fig. 10 . As this graph shows, the range for mean preferred temperatures varied and we selected two sets that have the maximum difference in their mean preferred temperatures (the first set had 22.06 °C and the second set had 23.01 °C). The contextual meaning of having these two sets is that there are two groups of occupants with different temperature preferences (and thus preferred setpoints) overall. These two data sets enabled us to quantify the bounds of energy saving potentials. Fig. 11 shows the temperature preferences for each set of profiles. We confirmed the normality of each human agent\u2019s set of thermal votes by using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, one of the widely used normality tests [42]. The first set had a lower variance, indicative of more similarity between the preferred setpoints of human agents, compared to the second set. In the following subsections, we have divided the presentation of findings according to the impact of individual parameters in our study in the following order: (1) number of occupants in a single zone, (2) increase in the number of thermal zones, and (3) varied climate conditions. Except for climate, parameters have been evaluated for three control strategies as described in the methodology section. 4.1 The impact of the number of occupants (individual comfort profiles) Fig. 12 presents how energy consumption has varied depending on (1) the number of human agents in one single thermal zone and (2) the control strategy. To focus on the impact caused by these two factors, Albuquerque was solely used as the location on the account of its mixed climate nature. Different columns of this figure represent the results of the analyses for different numbers of occupants in thermal zones and different rows show the control strategy for integration of personal thermal comfort profiles. The bars in Fig. 12 represent the histograms of energy consumption across different combinatorial realizations. The darker shades differentiate the results for the second set with higher average preferred temperatures from the results for the first set (lighter shades). It is worth noting that the benchmark energy consumptions across the columns in Fig. 12 are different due to the differences in the number of occupants, which in turn, affect the required thermal conditioning load. The realizations for these two sets help us differentiate the impact of personal thermal comfort profiles on energy consumption and efficiency expectations from comfort-driven control. Fig. 13 summarizes the observations in Fig. 12. Fig. 13A presents the percentage of energy use difference on average for different numbers of human agents and different control strategies and Fig. 13B presents variations in the percentage of energy saving cases (an estimate for the cumulative probability of achieving energy saving by using comfort-driven control) under different circumstances. The realizations for the second set showed more energy savings on average, compared to the benchmark regardless of the control strategy (Fig. 13A). The best case, achieved by having six human agents and applying the majority rule approach, had 5.3% of energy saving on average with a standard deviation of 5.6%. On the other hand, the realizations for the first set showed higher energy use in most of the cases, compared to the benchmark. The error minimization approach showed the highest energy use, and specifically, with six human agents, it spent 3.7% more energy on average with a standard deviation of 4.8%. Having the mean value of thermal preferences (23.01 °C) above the benchmark setpoint (22.5 °C) for the second set of human agents resulted in such an outcome. On the other hand, the use of the first set with a relatively low average thermal preference (22.06 °C), compared to the benchmark setpoint, resulted in an increased overall energy consumption (Fig. 13A). Furthermore, Fig. 13B presents the energy saving potential bounds under a wide range of realizations and quantifies the energy saving potentials under the uncertainty of diverse occupancy scenarios. As this figure shows, for different operational configurations, an upper-bound of energy saving probability (i.e., the highest possibility of having energy-saving scenarios) between 70.0 and 93.3% is observed. On the other hand, a lower-bound of energy saving probability between 0.0 and 11.5% is observed. For the best performing control strategy, this lower-bound of energy saving was between 19.2% and 32.3%. Given that we have selected two sets of human-agents with the maximum distance between average preferred temperatures, this observation shows that on average, there is a possibility that in almost 3.5\u201380.3% of occupancy scenarios, the use of comfort-driven control could lead to energy savings. Throughout the evaluations for all the scenarios (i.e., combinations of thermal comfort profiles), regardless of the control strategy, it was observed that a denser population in a thermal zone limits the selection of setpoints because many conflicts (i.e., desiring the opposite side of setpoints) exist between human agents. In other words, the setpoint selection converges to the mean value of the preferred temperatures from different profiles. Hence, the distributions for different realizations in energy consumption analyses have narrowed. This trend demonstrates that, for multi-occupancy spaces with relatively dense occupancy, the conventional operational models such as the PMV model - characterizing the satisfaction of a large group of people - is a reasonable approach. This is an important finding that the integration of personal comfort models is more effective in thermal zones with a lower number of occupants. However, occupancy in buildings is dynamic and the number of occupants could vary across time. Therefore, in a responsive and adaptive building system, the dynamic diversity of personal models in thermal zones provides opportunities for dynamic setpoint adjustment and lead to saving energy. Thus, the employment of personal thermal comfort profiles is crucial given the variety of mean preferred temperatures. These observations further accentuate the necessity of facilitating and enhancing HBI, rather than applying the most-likely desired setpoint. When it comes to the impact of the control strategies, the approach that seeks to minimize the deviation (error) between thermal preference and the temperature in the zone (the second approach) showed the most energy consumption followed by the approach that uses the thermal comfort sensitivity as shown in Fig. 13. For the first (majority rule) and third (thermal comfort sensitivity) strategies, the HVAC agent finds the optimal setpoint by starting from the setback (i.e., a low conditioning load) and moves the setpoint until reaching a point of no conflict. With an odd number of human agents in a thermal zone, the majority vote approach could give higher weight to the majority. However, with even number of occupants and evenly distributed thermal votes, this approach stops the setpoint selection process closer to the setback once the sum of the thermal votes is zero, which could be interpreted as the outcome of a drifting strategy [43]. In drifting, with the objective of reducing energy consumption, the HVAC agent seeks to shift the setpoint closer to a setback or outdoor temperature until a thermal dissatisfaction vote is reported. However, the approach based on thermal comfort sensitivity can move further away from the setback given its evaluation process of accounting for thermal comfort sensitivities in addition to preferences. Lastly, the error minimization approach selects a setpoint somewhere in between all the preferred temperatures, which often results in more conditioning loads than the other approaches. 4.2 The impact of increased number of thermal zones Fig. 14 presents how energy consumption has varied according to (1) the number of human agents distributed across multiple zones and (2) different control strategies. Similarly, Albuquerque was selected as the location for the representative climate. In these analyses, the number of the occupants per zone will reduce but more complex combinations of profiles were tested across multiple zones. As Fig. 14 shows in the reported values on the graphs, with the increase in the number of thermal zones, similar general trends in terms of average energy consumption could be observed across different control strategies and as the number of occupants increases. The higher the number of human agents in each thermal zone, the narrower the energy use distributions. Moreover, the first set of comfort profiles showed higher energy consumption, compared to the second set. Lastly, as discussed, the error minimization strategy consumed the most energy and the thermal-comfort-sensitivity-based approach followed. In these analyses, the most noticeable difference, as reflected in Fig. 16 , is that the variance of the energy use distributions increased, which could be associated with increased combinations of setpoints in the building due to the increase in the number of thermal zones. This observation does not hold true for the majority rule approach (i.e. higher variances were observed in the single zone results of Fig. 12), which could be associated with the nature of this control strategy as it often chooses setpoints away from the mean preferred temperatures even with a large number of human agents. The increased variance is important as it increases the possibility of energy saving, compared to the benchmark control strategy of using predetermined setpoint as reflect in Fig. 17 , which summarizes the observations in Fig. 14. Fig. 17A presents the percentage of energy saving on average for different contextual factors and different control strategies and Fig. 17B presents an estimate for the cumulative probability of achieving energy saving by using comfort-driven control under different circumstances. Furthermore, quantitative assessments showed that having more thermal zones and a small number of human agents per thermal zone in the building resulted in an overall lower energy consumption as shown by the mean values in Fig. 15. Fig. 17 demonstrates that even with the use of the first set of comfort profiles, the approach based on the majority rule showed slight energy saving potentials on average when having two, four, or eight occupants (human agents) in each thermal zone (Fig. 17A). The highest energy demand was from the error minimization approach for two human agents, expending 3.1% of more energy with a standard deviation of 4.9%, compared to the benchmark. On the other hand, with the second set of profiles and two human agents in each thermal zone, the majority rule approach (the best case) showed an average energy saving of 9.1% with a standard deviation of 5.1% (Fig. 17A) with 95.85% of different combinations showing energy saving (Fig. 17B). By comparing Fig. 13 and Fig. 17, it could be seen that an increase in the number of thermal zones (and reducing the occupancy density) highly increased the probability of having energy-saving cases. With a similar level of uncertainty in the diversity of human agents, we could observe improvements in both lower and upper bounds of energy saving probability. That is, by averaging the values for different numbers of occupants, there is a possibility that in a range of 16.9\u201395.2% of occupancy scenarios, the use of comfort-driven control could lead to energy savings. For the best performing control strategy in the lower-bound, this range will be between 57.4% and 95.2% 4.3 The impact of climate In Fig. 18 , we have presented the energy use patterns, caused by different numbers of human agents and varied thermal comfort profiles in three different climates. These analyses were conducted by using the third control strategy to limit the independent variables. Fig. 19 summarizes the observations in Fig. 18 to show the percentage of energy use differences and an estimate of the cumulative probability of energy saving cases for each configuration. Fig. 19A summarizes the observations in the single thermal zone on the left two columns of Fig. 18, and Fig. 19B summarizes the observations across multiple thermal zones on the right two columns of Fig. 18. The results of using diverse comfort profiles in different climate zones have shown similar trends as observed in Figs. 12 and 14. Similar effects from the number of occupants and the number of thermal zones when using personal comfort profile integration into control loops could be observed across different climates. By increasing the number of zones, the variance of the energy use distributions increases that in turn results in an increased cumulative probability of energy saving cases. This observation demonstrates the dominant role of thermal comfort profiles in comfort-driven control. Furthermore, the impact of different climate conditions is manifested in the change of average energy consumption \u2013 i.e., the cooler climates call for reduced energy consumption for cooling. Compared to the average energy consumption in the representative mixed climate (Albuquerque \u2013 the first row in Fig. 18), we observed an almost 1.0 MWh increase in the representative hot climate (Tucson - the second row in Fig. 18) and an almost 4.0 MWh decrease in the representative cold climate (Great Falls \u2013 the third row in Fig. 18). These results provide an estimate of the energy saving magnitudes and are compatible with the fact that the difference between indoor and outdoor temperatures is a key factor in driving energy consumption differences. Fig. 20 presents an illustration that summarizes the observed impact of different studied parameters on the energy use distributions by using comfort-driven control: \u2022 The mean of energy use distributions is dominantly determined by thermal comfort characteristics of occupants as a group (i.e., mean value of the preferred temperatures) followed by the control strategy. \u2022 The variance of energy use distributions is also highly influenced by thermal comfort characteristics of occupants, followed by the number of occupants in a thermal zone and the number of thermal zones (the number of thermal zones plays a part in reducing occupancy density in a thermal zone). \u2022 An increase in the variance of energy use distributions results in an increase in the cumulative probability of energy saving circumstances under the uncertainty of multi-occupancy scenarios. \u2022 The control strategies have shown to affect performance. The approach based on thermal comfort sensitivity has shown to be the second most effective approach after the approach based on the majority thermal vote. 4.4 Energy efficiency evaluation As noted, energy efficiency in the context of this study looks at the intersection of energy use and thermal comfort satisfaction. When it comes to the improvement in thermal comfort (as calculated by Eq. (4)), the thermal-comfort-sensitivity-based approach had the best and the majority rule approach was the next as shown in Fig. 21 . In general, the increase in the number of human agents reduces the benefits of comfort-driven control \u2013 that is, it is desirable to have low occupancy density across thermal zones for an increased gain from adaptive HBI. To account for energy efficiency (i.e., energy use for thermal satisfaction), the overall performance improvement by each control strategy were calculated by using Eq. (5) as presented in Fig. 22 . For the occupants in the first set, the thermal-comfort-sensitivity-based approach revealed the best overall performance despite its relatively higher energy use. Compared to the majority rule approach, the thermal comfort improvement from the thermal-sensitivity-based approach has contributed the most in this observation. The error minimization approach showed an underwhelming performance primarily due to its higher energy demand. On the other hand, with the second set, the majority rule approach was the best except for the case with two occupants. These observations demonstrate that having thermal zones with a small number of occupants brings about higher energy efficiency when using a comfort-driven control strategy. As before, the overall benefits of comfort-driven control were curtailed with a larger number of human agents. 5 Limitation and discussion In this section, we elaborated on the limitations of this study to open the discussion to the research community. We intentionally have chosen two sets of thermal comfort profiles at tail ends of the distribution (as depicted in Fig. 10) on the account of their potential for demonstrating a wide range of difference in occupants\u2019 diversity and difference in energy use. Given that these profiles were developed using realistic data, both datasets represent real-world scenarios. Moreover, complaints of over-conditioning from occupants in buildings shows that the application of comfort-driven HVAC control could potentially result in energy saving and improved thermal comfort. For future research, as the public datasets on thermal comfort become available in the community and get expanded (through efforts like [44]), more insight into the diversity of personal thermal comfort profiles could be provided. One of the core assumptions in our developed ABM framework is that each human agent seeks to maximize thermal comfort. However, in reality, other human behavior attributes can come to play in determining the energy use of HVAC control. For instance, the energy saving objectives might affect the desire of maximizing thermal comfort. Given the differences in occupant behavior (as they might perceive comfort differently and react to variations of temperature differently), the personal differences in decision-making processes with regard to the tradeoff between energy use and comfort (i.e., adaptive behavior) could also be influential in the energy efficiency of HVAC systems. In other words, the use of personal thermal comfort models is one of the drivers in HITL HVAC control. Another limitation is the static nature of thermal comfort profiles across different simulations. Although this was part of the design for this study, long-term acclimation to the climate has been demonstrated in the literature [45] that could affect the change in thermal comfort profiles. A potential solution to this limitation could be the use of long-term field studies to ensure diversity in observations as is the objective of data-sharing. Moreover, despite the capability of implementing dynamic occupancy profiles and updating thermal comfort profiles in our proposed ABM framework, we restricted the occupancy level and the possibility of changing thermal comfort profiles of human agents for the ease of interpretation in answering the research questions. Another factor that could be further studied is the probability of user engagement in comfort-driven control. An interesting question is whether the advances in technologies such as wearables help with a higher rate of engagement. Also, further analyses on scenarios of partial engagement could be explored. Lastly, as pointed out by Shin et al. [29], applying a single setpoint derived from a comfort-driven control strategy throughout the entire operation might violate fairness. As an example, when two occupants have conflicting thermal preferences and a control strategy is biased towards one, the other occupant might be dissatisfied all the time. Therefore, alternating between different occupants\u2019 preferred temperatures could increase fairness. However, the energy implication of such a strategy needs further assessment given that a quick transitioning between different setpoints could result in excessive energy consumption [46]. The findings of this study could be characterized as (i) an in-depth understanding of the impact of different contextual factors that affect the energy performance of comfort-driven control in buildings, and (ii) providing probabilistic bounds of energy use variation under different contextual conditions, which could be used in probabilistic simulations of building energy performance. Therefore, these findings could contribute to studies with the goal of energy performance improvement at the building level (e.g., [47,48]), as well as studies that look at demand-response (e.g., [49,50]) and integration of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) (e.g., [48]) at both building and community levels. Contextual conditions and the sensitivity of the control algorithms to these conditions are critical in understanding the potentials for adaptive operation of HVAC systems in buildings that bring about improved energy performance. Adaptive operations could also contribute to quantification (specifically probabilistic quantification) of load flexibility that determines the capacity of the loads for demand-response and peak load shaving as well as compatibility with different DERs such as renewable energy resources and storage systems. 6 Conclusion In this study, we have investigated the energy efficiency implications of comfort-driven HVAC control strategies \u2013 i.e., integrating personal thermal comfort profiles of occupants into the control loop of HVAC systems \u2013 in multioccupancy scenarios to better understand their potentials under a diverse set of contextual conditions. Prior research studies have evaluated the performances of comfort-driven control for specific contextual conditions and reported both positive and negative energy saving outcomes. These observations have called for a comprehensive understanding of the efficacy of comfort-driven HVAC control in terms of energy efficiency. By reviewing the literature and the reported energy efficiency trends, we identified the potential parameters that could affect the energy efficiency of these strategies: (1) the diversity in occupants\u2019 thermal comfort characteristics and uncertainty in multi-occupancy scenarios, (2) the thermal zone configuration, (3) climate, and (4) the control strategy. To this end, by synthesizing diverse sets of personal thermal comfort profiles, sampled from real-world comfort profiles, we employed an agent-based modeling framework, coupled with EnergyPlus simulations. Using this simulation tool, we have investigated quantified bounds of energy saving potentials given the uncertainty in multi-occupancy spaces for different combinatorial scenarios. The thermal comfort profiles were selected to be distributed across a range of preferred indoor temperatures to show the impact of diversity in individual differences. Moreover, we accounted for different numbers and combinations of occupants, two thermal zone configurations, three control strategies, and three climate conditions. In these evaluations, we looked at the histogram of energy use across different combinatorial realizations, leading to a comprehensive evaluation of comfort-driven control. The results showed that the occupants\u2019 thermal comfort characteristics and the number of occupants per thermal zone are the most impactful parameters in shaping the energy use distributions and determining the energy saving potentials of comfort-driven control. In other words, if the average of preferred temperatures by occupants in a building lies above the standard setpoints, the probability of energy saving increases and vice versa. However, regardless of the average preferred temperature by groups of occupants, diversity in personal differences could create energy saving opportunities in a building. Our analyses over a wide spectrum of occupants\u2019 characteristics show an average estimate for cumulative probability of energy saving cases in a range between 3.5% and 80.3% for a single thermal zone and in a range between 16.9% and 95.2% for multiple thermal zones. For the best performing control strategy, the lower-bound values improve and these ranges will be 29.2%−80.3% and 57.4%−95.2%, respectively. The average (±standrad deviation) energy saving potentials from these cases were between −3.7 ± 4.8% and 5.3 ± 5.6% for a single zone, and between −3.1 ± 4.9% and 9.1 ± 5.1% for multiple zones. For the best performing control strategy, the lower-bound average energy savings were −0.7% and −0.3%, respectively. Analyses on energy efficiency (i.e., the use of energy for improving thermal comfort) showed that as the number of occupants per multi-occupancy zones increases, the opportunities for energy efficiency improvement by using personal comfort profiles decreases. The use of comfort-driven control showed to have an upper-bound average of 21% to 11% of improvements in energy efficiency when a thermal zone is shared by two to six occupants, respectively. By having more than six occupants per zone, the benefits of using personal comfort diminish although there are still potentials for improved energy performance. In those cases, the performance from the integration of personal comfort models converges to that of conventional generalized models. In addition, control strategies were proven to be effective in driving the energy efficiency of operations. Specifically, the thermal-comfort-sensitivity-based approach showed to result in the best performance in generating collectively comfortable conditions and the majority rule approach was shown to be more energy efficient than the other strategies. Among the future directions of this study are the investigation of energy efficiency potentials at the intersection of occupancy and comfort modalities, as well as investigating the impact of temperature distributions through more advanced simulations or field studies, where the temperature distributions across a thermal zone could be affected by different contextual variables and result in varied occupant experiences.

However, some conflicting cases with increased energy consumption were also reported. Addressing the limited and focused nature of those demonstrations, in this study, we have presented a comprehensive assessment of the energy efficiency implications of comfort-driven control to (i) understand the impact of a wide range of contextual factors and their combinatorial effect and (ii) identify the operational conditions that benefit from personal comfort integration. In doing so, we have proposed an agent-based modeling framework, coupled with EnergyPlus simulations. We considered five potentially influential parameters and their combinatorial arrangements including occupants\u2019 thermal comfort characteristics, diverse multi-occupancy scenarios, number of occupants in thermal zones, control strategies, and climate. We identified the most influencing factor to be the variations across occupants\u2019 thermal comfort characteristics - reflected in probabilistic models of personal thermal comfort - followed by the number of occupants that share a thermal zone, and the control strategy in driving the collective setpoint in a zone. In thermal zones, shared by fewer than six occupants, we observed potentials for average energy efficiency gain in a range between −3.5% and 21.4% from comfort-driven control. Accounting for a wide range of personal comfort profiles and number of occupants, the average (±standard deviation) energy savings for a single zone and multiple zones were in ranges of [−3.7 ± 4.8%, 5.3 ± 5.6%] and [−3.1 ± 4.9%, 9.1 ± 5.1%], respectively. Across all multi-occupancy scenarios, a range between 0.0% and 96.0% of combinations resulted in energy savings.",
