Thermally Activated Building Systems (TABS) has great energy flexibility potential for the effective demand response, but the inherent large thermal inertia creates challenges for the control. Model Predictive Control (MPC) can improve the control efficiency while achieving certain objectives. However, the modeling mechanism of the TABS thermal behavior can lead to the difference in the controller performances. In this study, the white-box model, grey-box model, and black-box model based MPCs (referred to as W-MPC, G-MPC, and B-MPC) are developed and analyzed in depth for a case TABS with high heat flexibility potential. The performances of MPC strategies are investigated together with the baseline Rule Based Control (RBC) strategy under normal conditions as well as a variety of uncertainty events. In general, MPC strategies show better performance compared to the RBC. The prediction-based control can effectively maintain the indoor temperature within the constraints considering the uncertain disturbances and the gradual outdoor climate change. Moreover, MPC strategies help to increase the cost savings due to the effective load shifting by 30%\u201350%, and enhance the flexible energy utilization by 14%\u201329%. In terms of the comparison among the different MPC strategies, W-MPC shows better performance in the room temperature control, which reduces the violation of the indoor temperature constraint by 30% and 15% compared to G-MPC and B-MPC, respectively. G-MPC shows slight superiority concerning the economy and flexible energy usage. The normalized cost saving of G-MPC is approximately 3% and 8% lower compared to the W-MPC and B-MPC, respectively, while the utilization efficiencies of the flexible energy are approximately 6% and 12% higher.

HVAC systems in buildings often consume more than 40 % of the total building energy usage, which show great potential for energy savings [3]. Advanced technologies in the buildings field, such as the TABS can serve as the alternative to the traditional HVAC systems to reduce the energy use and improve the occupant comfort. It is a type of radiant systems that embeds pipes inside the building structure, such as walls, floors or ceilings, as shown in Fig. 1 . By regulating the temperature or flowrate of the thermal media inside the embedded pipe, the building mass of TABS can be charged or discharged on purpose [4\u20136]. However, previous studies have also reported challenges associated with the TABS control due to their large thermal inertia. The time delay between the certain control event and the change of the actual state parameters sometimes ranges for hours, depending on the layouts of the pipes and the thermal capacity of the building slabs. The traditional on\u2013off or proportional-integral (PI) control method lacks the capability to compensate for the thermal lag and cannot respond promptly to the sudden load changes in the thermal environment [8]. Therefore, it can be rather difficult for the conventional control strategy to effectively integrate the dynamic heat source and the demand side of TABS. The effectiveness of the MPC has been verified by plenty of studies [9]. It integrates model-based prediction, numerical optimization, and feedback control. In the past decade, MPC has gained significant interest in the built environment control, and control-oriented building thermal models are of great importance for the successful implementation of MPC. These models should capture the actual building thermodynamics and satisfactorily predict the future evolutions, and have to be computationally efficient at the same time. Generally, the building simulation models can be sorted into three categories: white-box models, black-box models, and grey-box models [10]. The white-box model, based on the physical information, can be highly accurate and generated by simulation software such as EnergyPlus, Dymola, and TRNSYS [11], requiring complete physical knowledge of the building (including geometry, material properties, structure, etc.) [12]. The black-box model disregards physical principles and relies purely on historical data, typically established using machine learning methods [12]. It requires large datasets for training [11], which is often the most challenging process. The grey-box model is a mix of the physically-based and experience-based models. The Resistance-Capacitance (RC) model is a common type of the grey models, for which the experimental data is used to identify parameters. Literatures often mention the benefits of the grey-box models because they allow for a physical interpretation of model parameters and an understanding of some underlying physical phenomena behind building behavior [13]. The intelligent operation control strategies based on MPC have been applied in various building scenarios. Joe et al. developed an intelligent operating strategy based on MPC to optimize the performance of the liquid-circulating radiant floor systems in the office buildings. The MPC results showed that compared to the baseline feedback control in the cooling season, the MPC saves the cost by 34 % and the reduction of the energy consumption is 16 % during the heating season [14]. Freund et al. developed an MPC strategy for a large low-energy office building to optimize the embedded pipe temperature of TABS, and the heat consumption was reduced by 30 % compared to traditional RBC [15]. Drgona et al. developed a white-box MPC for the TABS office building with a ground source heat pump and compared the performance with the traditional RBC strategies. The results indicate the MPC helped to achieve 53.5 % energy savings for the ground source heat pump and improve the thermal comfort by 36.9 % [16]. The energy flexibility potential from the demand side is of great importance for the regulation of energy system with dynamic energy sources, such as RES (renewable energy sources). Kathirgamanathan et al. [17] have highlighted that predictive control allows buildings to utilize the available energy flexibility from the building thermal mass more effectively. The core concept is that the predictive control strategies can accurately forecast building energy demand and the environmental conditions. This foresight enables the control system to make proactive adjustments to HVAC setpoint, perform load shifting, or integrate with other sources of flexibility, such as active thermal storage systems, active electrical storage systems, and electric vehicles. Zhang et al. [18] developed an MPC strategy for the small and medium-sized commercial buildings with on-site renewable energy sources. They tested two types of demand flexibility applications. The results indicated that, compared to the baseline scenario, the proposed control strategy can save 12 % electricity costs annually and reduce the peak demand by 34 %, while maintaining thermal comfort. As the effect of the MPC strategy strongly relies on the accurate simulation of the thermal behavior of the object of study, it is also of interest to investigate the performances of different types of MPC. Picard et al. compared the performances of the grey-box model with the existing white-box model of an office building. It was found that the white-box MPC achieved better thermal comfort and 50 % energy reduction compared to the grey-box model. However, the authors stated that further research is needed to confirm the strengths of the white-box method under the uncertainties [19]. Mugnini et al. compared the white-box models with the black-box models based on ANN (artificial neural network) architecture. The results showed that although both control strategies had similar energy-saving performances compared to the baseline control, the room temperature controlled by the data-driven MPC leaves greater deviation from the setpoint, mainly due to the difficulty in developing the correctly trained data-driven models [20]. Arendt et al. made a direct comparison of the three MPC paradigms with the representative models. However, they only analyzed the fitting accuracy of the indoor temperatures and did not explicitly investigate the other control performances [21]. The research mentioned above demonstrate the development of MPC strategies for various building scenarios. Though some studies compare the performances of MPCs in adopting different modeling methodologies for the specific buildings, few of them put the building energy flexibility on the first place for the control. As a result, the advantage of the buildings with significant energy flexibility, such as TABS, cannot be maximized. The performances of different MPCs concerning the flexibility potential need to be compared so to characterize the exact optimal solution. Moreover, the control effects and the evaluation indicators from multiple dimensions in different scenarios have not been sufficiently studied. In order to address the above-mentioned research gaps, this study developed the MPC strategies for TABS of a case residential building based on white-box, grey-box and black-box models. The impact of adopting different building modeling methods on the MPC performance was investigated by comparing the results of the room temperature, the operation cost, and the energy flexibility utilization together with the rule-based control. Different stochastic disturbances were imposed to the system to test the robustness of the control strategies under the uncertainties. The results of this study can be useful to improve the control effectiveness of the TABS with large thermal inertia, as well as providing useful knowledge of developing suitable control strategy concerning energy flexibility utilization. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the information of the case study and simulation framework. Section 3 develops the uncertainty scenarios for the control evaluation and the multi-dimensional indices. Section 4 presents the results according to the detailed comparisons. The advantages, applicability, and limitations of the three MPC strategies are discussed in Section 5. The final conclusions are drawn in Section 6. 2 Building system and simulation framework 2.1 Description of the case study The case study is a single-family house built under the standard of NZEB (net zero energy buildings). The building's east side is adjacent to an unheated area designated for storage, whilst the north side of the house is a garage. The net heating area of the case study is 132 m 2 and the total air volume is 360.6 m 3 . The thermal technical properties of the building are shown in Table 1 . The ratio of the heating area to the volume of the building is 36.6 %, the percentage of glazing of the building envelope is 11.2 %. An in-building substation is installed for heat exchanging between the supply side and demand side. In the case study, an air source heat pump is applied as the heat source concerning the investment cost. While for the larger-scale building or community, other types, such as the ground-source heat pump, can be considered as alternative solution because of the better COP, lower carbon emissions, and more stable operation performances [22]. The variable frequency of the air source heat pump enables the economy optimization concerning the dynamic electricity price. The detailed parameters of the heat pump under the nominal conditions are shown in Table 2 . The indoor heat load is covered by the floor-type TABS. The natural ventilation is the main method to adjust the indoor humidity and air quality of the case building. To avoid the overheating risk, the louvers are installed in the case building and takes around 5 % of the window area. Fig. 2 displays the layout and the heating configuration of the case study. In order to guarantee the supply safety, the coldest two weeks of the year (1st February to 14th February) were applied as the simulation period. Fig. 3 shows the outdoor weather data of the simulation period, which is derived from the typical meteorological year of Tianjin from the website of the Energy Plus weather database [23]. In order to demonstrate that the case TABS exhibits typical thermal response dynamics and to ensure comparability of the research findings with other TABS, we calculated the Heat Storage Efficiency (HSE) of the case system, which is 51.3 %. More details of the calculation method of HSE can be found in [24]. HSE has been shown to effectively reflect the thermal response characteristics of radiant system regardless of the system and material. This metric is particularly valuable for assessing the controllability of systems with high thermal inertia, which is especially useful for the development of the rule based control strategies. 2.2 Control models 2.2.1 White-box MPC The TABS model was established using Dymola software, which is based on the Modelica language. The simulation model of the building system is comprised of four components: the room module, the in-building substation module, the heat source module, and the controller module. The model inputs of the white-box model include building physics information, occupancy, and weather data (such as the outdoor dry-bulb temperature, wet-bulb temperature, solar radiation, relative humidity, wind speed, etc). The existing components from the Buildings library [25] were used for the model establishment. The system diagram of the white-box MPC is shown in Fig. 4 . To facilitate the optimization and solution of the optimal control sequence, Python is used to couple the white-box model with the MPC control module. The MPC control module receives hourly room temperature data from the local sensors. Regarding the control algorithm, the genetic algorithm (GA) is considered as the core algorithm of the MPC. With the influence of the disturbance, the genetic algorithm solves the objective function concerning the requirements of thermal comfort and the limit of the facility capacities. The optimal control sequence is then fed back to the controller module of the while-box model. The GA algorithm was first proposed by Bagley in 1967 [26]. The genetic algorithm selection operation consists of a variety of methods such as roulette method, tournament method, etc. In this paper, we adopt the use of the roulette method and set the crossover probability to 0.7 and the mutation probability to 0.3. In each generation, 70 % of the individuals undergo crossover, and 30 % of the individuals undergo mutation, and the probability p i of each individual i being selected is: (1) p i = f i ∑ j = 0 n f i where f i is the fitness value of the individual i and N = 100 is chosen to be the number of the individuals in the population. Since the individuals were coded in real numbers, the crossover method was chosen as hybrid crossover, and for each pair of chromosomes a i and b i from the parent, the offspring chromosome c i was calculated as. (2) c i = 1 - β · a i + β · b i where β is a random number between [ 0 , 1 ] . The mutation method uses Gaussian variation, and for each chromosome a i of an individual, the compiled chromosome a i \u2032 is calculated as: (3) a i \u2032 = a i + N 0 , σ 2 where N 0 , σ 2 denotes the normal distribution with mean estimation value of 0 and the variance of σ 2 , and standard deviation σ controls the magnitude of the variation. Considering that the changes in the control sequence should not be very large, we set it to 0.3. 2.2.2 Grey-box MPC The grey-box model based on RC (thermal resistance and capacity) analogy is usually used as the simplified model to describe the thermal dynamics of a building [10]. As shown in Fig. 5 , we develop the Grey-box model according to the specific heat transfer process.For simplicity, the temperature distribution of the indoor air, the surface of the building envelope and the surface of the TABS is considered as uniform respectively, thus the temperature node of the corresponding heat transfer surface can be represented by a single node. The RC model of the TABS consists of the temperature node of the water in the embedded pipe, the thermal resistance from the upper surface of the pipe to the upper surface of the heated floor, and the thermal resistance from the lower surface of the pipe to the soil. The differential equations are developed from the energy balance: (4) dT e dt = T o - T e C e R w , o + T in - T e C e R w , i n + σ e d ω 1 dt (5) dT in dt = T e - T in C in R w , i n + T fl - T in C in R fl , i n + T o - T in C in R win + Q in C in + σ in d ω 2 dt (6) dT fl dt = T in - T fl C fl R fl , i n + T pp - T fl C fl R pp , f l + A w fP s C fl + σ fl d ω 3 dt (7) dT pp dt = T fl - T pp C pp R pp , f l + T b - T pp C pp R pp , o u t + Q heating C pp + σ pp d ω 4 dt (8) Q heating = c m T heatpump . s u p p l y - T heatpump . r e t u r n where T e represents the temperature of the building envelope; T o represents the temperature of the outdoor air; T in represents the temperature of the indoor air; T fl represents the temperature of the upper surface of the heated floor; T pp is the temperature of the collector node assuming the entire plane of the pipeline; T b is the temperature of the soil; C e represents the specific heat capacity of the exterior wall; C in represents the specific heat capacity of the indoor air; C fl represents the specific heat capacity of the floor; C pp is the specific heat capacity of the entire pipeline; R w , o represents the thermal resistance between the outdoor air and the building envelope; R w , i n represents the thermal resistance between the building envelope and indoor air; R win represents the thermal resistance of windows; R fl , i n represents the thermal resistance of indoor air to the floor; R pp , f l represents the thermal resistance of the pipe to the inner surface of the floor; R pp , o u t represents the thermal resistance of the lower surface of the pipe to the soil; A w represents the area of the exterior windows; P s represents the solar radiation; f represents the effective conversion coefficient of solar radiation; Q heating is the TABS of the heat supply, but in actual control, the water flow rate m is controlled by adjusting the valve opening to influence Q heating ; Q in is the heat generation from the people in the building; σ i = d w i dt represents the process perturbation of each item; and each node RC is the parameter to be recognized. The ordinary differential equations Eqs. (4)\u2013(7) describe the dynamic thermal model of the case building with TABS heating system. The differential equations were then changed into the form of the continuous-time state-space model with unknown random perturbations as shown in Eq. (9): (9) dx = A x + B u + E d d t + d w t where x is the state vector, x = ⌈ T e T in T fl T pp ⌉ T ; u = Q heating is the control input vector ; d is the disturbance vector, d = ⌈ T o P s T b Q in ⌉ T ; w t is a stochastic wiener process with the independent normally distribution. The system matrix A can be presented as: A = ⌈ - 1 C e R w , o - 1 C e R w , i n 1 C e R w , i n 0 0 1 C in R w , i n - 1 C in R w , i n - 1 C in R fl , i n - 1 C i n R w i n 1 C in R fl , i n 0 0 1 C fl R fl , i n - 1 C fl R fl , i n - 1 C fl R pp , f l 1 C fl R pp , f l 0 0 1 C pp R pp , f l - 1 C pp R pp , f l - 1 C pp R pp , o u t ⌉ ; The input matrix B is: B = 0 0 0 1 C pp T ; The disturbance matrix E is: E = 1 C e R w , o 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 C in 0 A w C fl 0 0 0 0 1 C pp R pp , o u t 0 MPC are typically used in discrete-time domain whereas the state space equations are continuity equations and thus need to be transformed at a fixed sampling rate of the Ts time step. The authors use the zero-order hold method to discretize the continuity differential equations, i.e., the control signal values are kept constant for the whole sampling time span and converted from the digital signal to the analogue signal as shown in Eqs. (10) and (11) for the period [ t k , t k + 1 ]. (10) t k = t 0 + k T s , k = 0 , 1 , 2 , ⋯ (11) u t = u k , t k ≤ t ≤ t k + 1 Eqs. (12)\u2013(17) are the results of the discretization of the above continuous equations at the sampling time Ts. x k is the state vector, u k is the input vector being controlled, y k is the observation vector, and w k is the process noise. It is assumed that all the random variables obey normal distribution. Eqs. (12)-(13) are used in the MPC to predict the system performance. (12) x k + 1 = A d x k + B d u k + E d d k + w k (13) y k = C d x k where Ad, Bd, Ed and Cd are the results after discretization using the zero-order holding method under condition T s = 1 h . (14) A d = e A T s (15) B d = ∫ 0 T s B e A τ d τ (16) E d = ∫ 0 T s E e A τ d τ (17) C d = 0 1 0 0 Before starting the model prediction, the unknown model parameters need to be identified based on the historical data. In this study two-weeks historical data of the case study were used to estimate the unknown parameters with CTSM-R [27]. Model calibration was performed using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) as shown in Eq. (18), where A t is the actual value and F t is the corresponding predicted value. The results of the model validation will be present in section 4. The solution for the Grey-box MPC was solved by the YALMIP toolbox [28] and the Gurobi solver [29]. The work flow of the Grey-box MPC is shown in Fig. 6 . (18) RMSE = 1 n ∑ t = 1 n A t - P t 2 2.2.3 Black-box MPC The black-box models are generally established by the pure historical data. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network method, which is a type of neural network, is applied for training the black-box model in this study. LSTM was firstly introduced by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber in 1997 [30]. The previous studies have proven that LSTM has superior performance in predicting indoor temperatures in combination with MPC [31]. The schematic diagram of the LSTM model trained in this article is shown in Fig. 7 , and its training results will be presented in Chapter 4. As shown in Fig. 7, the forget gate of LSTM firstly decides which state information should be deleted, and its calculation method is shown in Eq. (19). Then, through Eqs. (20) and (21), the input gate and the candidate values decide which information to add to the cell state by calculating the probability of the input information and extracting the valid information using the tanh function. Integrating the outputs of the forget gate and input gate, the updated cell state can be calculated as shown in Eq. (22). The output gate determines the amount of information that should be exposed to the next hidden state and the output, and its calculation method is shown in Eqs. (23)-(24). (19) f t = σ ω f · h t - 1 , x t + b f (20) i t = σ ω i · h t - 1 , x t + b i (21) c ∼ t = tanh ω c · h t - 1 , x t + b c (22) c t = c t - 1 * f t + c ∼ t * i t (23) o t = σ ω o · h t - 1 , x t + b o (24) h t = o t * R e L U ( c t ) where f t outputs a value between 0 and 1, representing the probability that the information is discarded at the last moment, with 1 representing complete retention and 0 representing complete discard; σ represents the activation function sigmoid; ω f 、 ω t 、 ω c 、 ω o represent the weight of each neuron; x t represents the weight of the current moment t; h t represents the output of the neuron at the current moment; b f 、 b i 、 b c 、 b o are bias terms; i t represents the input information being retained with probability; c ∼ t is the information obtained from the input at the current moment; c t is the updated state value stored in the memory cell; c t - 1 represents the state value of the previous moment stored in the memory cell; tanh is the activation function. In terms of the black-box MPC establishment, the historical data including the outdoor temperature, the solar radiation, the control sequence, the occupancy rate, and the indoor temperature data from January are collected. A dataset is created using a rolling window approach. For each time step t, all features from t-6 to t (excluding indoor temperature) and the indoor temperature from t-6 to t-1 are used as the feature set. These features are combined into an input vector containing multi-step time series features. The indoor temperature at time step t is used as the target value. This process generates a feature-target pair dataset. After data cleaning and normalization, the dataset are divided into training and testing sets for the model in a ratio of 0.8\u20130.2. The model uses three LSTM layers, each with 128 units, and two Dropout layers, each with a dropout rate of 0.2. The activation function used is ReLU, and the optimizer is Adam. The number of training epochs is set to 100, with a batch size of 50. An early stopping strategy is also applied. The predictive model is kept improving by minimizing the error between the state parameters and the setpoint. Once the high-accuracy LSTM prediction model is obtained, the predicted room temperature will be sent to the MPC from the black-box model via Python. The MPC controller uses the genetic algorithm to solve the objective function, so that to obtains the optimal control sequence. The resulting control sequence will be used to regulate the heat pump. The system diagram of the black-box model is shown in Fig. 8 . 2.3 Objective functions and constraints As shown in Eq. (25), the objective function of the MPC controller aims at minimizing the energy cost of the heating system of the case study, while achieving high accuracy of the state parameter prediction (indoor temperature in this case). (25) J = min u 1 , u 2 ⋯ u t ∑ t = 1 N - 1 r u t p t + q T t - T set . t 2 Subject to: (26) u min ≤ u t ≤ u max (27) Δ u min ≤ Δ u t ≤ Δ u max (28) T min ≤ T t ≤ T max (29) Δ T min ≤ Δ T t ≤ Δ T max where N is the prediction time domain; p t is the electricity price at time t; r , q are weight factors of 50 and 1 respectively, to ensure their magnitudes are similar. u t is the input control signal at time t, which is actually the valve opening; u min is the minimum value of the control signal, is 0; u max is the maximum value of the control signal, is 1; Δ u t is the amount of change in the control signal at time t; Δ u min is the minimum amount of change in the control signal; Δ u max is the maximum amount of change in the control signal; T t is the actual room temperature at time t, and T min is the minimum value of the room temperature, which is 18 °C; T max is the maximum value of the room temperature, which is 22 °C; Δ T t is the amount of change of the room temperature at time t; Δ T min is the minimum amount of change of the room temperature; and Δ T max is the maximum amount of change of the room temperature. For the TABS terminal, the infrared radiation exchange plays a role in the indoor heat transfer. The indoor operative temperature, which integrates the impact of the indoor air temperature and the radiant temperature, is usually applied as the indicator for the indoor thermal comfort [32]. While regarding the control and operation in practice, most existing heating systems just install the sensors that measure the indoor air temperature. Therefore, this study adopts the indoor air temperature for the control strategy for simplicity and practical applicability. 2.4 Baseline control Rule-based Control (RBC) executes the specific control signals or actions when the certain conditions are met [33]. This paper uses RBC as the baseline control, considering the indoor thermal comfort temperature, occupancy rate, and local dynamic electricity price. The control for RBC utilizes PI controllers. The specific control strategies are shown in Fig. 9 (a)\u2013(d), concerning both the occupancy and the corresponding levels of the indoor thermal comfort temperatures according to the Chinese evaluation standard for the indoor thermal environment. In winter, the setpoint temperature of the space heating in residential buildings should be 18 ℃\u201324 ℃ [34]. As the heat pump is applied as the heat supplier, the energy cost is directly correlated to the power price. In the region where the case study is located, the dynamic tariff for the electricity consumed for the district heating is implemented. The specific power price can be found in Fig. 9(a). There are two peak periods during the one-day cycle, which are the periods of 8:00\u201311:00 and 18:00\u201323:00. The left time periods are considered as the valley period. It assumes that the residents leave for work at 8:00 in the morning and return home at 18:00, and such pattern is repeated during the test period, as shown in Fig. 9(c). Accordingly, the indoor temperature setpoints variates along with the occupancy, which is shown in Fig. 9(b). During the period when the residents are at home, the variable frequency heat pump is switched on to maintain the room temperature at 22 ℃. For the periods when the residents are out of the building, the room temperature was maintained at least 18℃, so that to avoid uncomfortable indoor temperature when the residents return home or extra heat loss due to the high setpoints. 3 Evaluation of the control strategies This chapter explains the investigations on the performances of different control methods under various uncertainty scenarios. It is important to note that both the MPCs based on different modeling mechanisms and the conventional RBC generate their own control sequences. Afterwards, the four sets of the control sequences were input to the same calibrated virtual test bench of the case study. Under the identical simulation environment, the performances of the tested control strategies are evaluated and compared using several key performance indices. The process is shown in Fig. 10 . 3.1 Uncertainty scenarios The previous researches demonstrate that the uncertainty is a significant challenge in the widespread use of MPC for building energy consumption optimization [35]. Building performance simulation uncertainty can be divided into the random and the epistemic uncertainties [36]. Random uncertainties mainly arise from the natural variations and intrinsic randomness, such as the uncontrollable external influences, weather changes, human behavior, and etc. The epistemic uncertainties primarily stem from the approximations, simplifications, errors, and assumptions in the model, such as the parameter uncertainties, the measurement errors, and etc. This study mainly discusses the performance of the control strategies under the certain random uncertainties. The uncertainty events due to different reasons are artificially imposed in the operation horizon between February 5th and 6th. Each uncertainty event is considered as independent to the others, thereby enabling the analyses the actual impact from the individual uncertainty events. 3.1.1 Control failure The normal operation of buildings strongly relies on control systems and sensors [37]. However, issues such as the equipment aging, the sensor malfunction, and the power outages are inevitable in the building systems and may lead to the control failures. Therefore, a control failure is set within the specified impact time range, which is shown as a lack of control response. As shown in Fig. 11 , the input was set to zero during the impact time range. 3.1.2 Extreme weather The climate change and extreme weather events can significantly impact the energy system consumption and the thermal comfort of the residential buildings [38,39]. Similar to the above, within the specified impact time range, an extreme cold wave event was set. Referencing from the historical temperature data of Tianjin, the lowest temperatures reported is −20℃. Therefore, the extreme weather uncertainty is created by replacing the original weather data by the extremely cold weather data during the impact time period, as shown in Fig. 12 . 3.1.3 Irregular occupancy The occupancy rates and the indoor human behavior play important role in the building energy simulation [40]. An increase in the number of the indoor occupants can lead to significant increase of the internal heat gain. In this paper, an irregular high occupancy rate is set within the specified impact time range, which is assumed five times as much as the normal state, as shown in Fig. 13 : 3.2 Evaluation index 3.2.1 Temperature control In order to provide the most suitable MPC for the precise control of the energy flexible buildings with large time delays, the absolute deviation between the room temperature and the setpoint temperature under different types of the model predictive control strategies and RBC strategy are calculated and compared by Eq. (30). Moreover, the violation of the indoor temperature constraint under different control strategies are analyzed by Eq. (31). (30) T violate = ∑ t = 1 N T state ( t ) - { T min ( t ) , T max ( t ) } (31) T absolute = ∑ t = 1 N T state ( t ) - T setpoint ( t ) where T state is the room temperature as the control results of different control strategy, T setpoint is the setpoint room temperature, T min , T max are the lower and higher boundaries of the room temperature setting, which are the same as the room temperature setting of the RBC strategy to conduct the fair comparison. The specific settings of T min and T max can be found in Fig. 8(c). T absolute and T violate are both the smaller the better. 3.2.2 Energy cost The energy cost is the important factor to evaluate the performance of the MPC. In this study, the heat pump, as the main heat source, is driven by the dynamic electricity tariff. Therefore, the discrepancies of the overall energy cost between MPC and RBC is generated since MPC optimizes the control sequence for better economy. The system energy cost under different types of MPCs and RBC are calculated and compared according to Eq. (32). (32) cost = ∑ t = 1 N - 1 ru ( t ) p ( t ) where r is the coefficient, ru ( t ) is the power consumption at moment t, and p ( t ) is the dynamic price of electricity at moment t. 3.2.3 Energy flexibility Flexibility factor (FF) was used to evaluate the load shifting capability of TABS from the high price to low price under each type of MPC and RBC operation [41,42], which can be calculated as in Eq. (33). (33) FF = ∫ low p r i c e t i m e u ( t ) d t - ∫ high p r i c e t i m e u ( t ) d t ∫ low p r i c e t i m e u ( t ) d t + ∫ high p r i c e t i m e u ( t ) d t The FF rangesfrom −1 to 1. The best case scenario is when FF = 1, indicating that all of the energy can be shifted to the low-price period. In contrast, an FF value of 0 indicates that the building's thermal mass has limited capacity to efficiently move the thermal load to the periods of the low energy prices. The most unfavorable scenario is when FF = −1, indicating that all energy consumption takes place during the high price period and the system lacks the ability to adjust the heat load. It should be noted that in order to make the performance comparisons more straightforward, the T absolute , T violate , and the cost metrics mentioned above are normalized to the respective indices of RBC, which is considered as the baseline scenario. 4 Result 4.1 Model validation An accurate model is the foundation for the subsequent work. In the case study, we performed long-term measurements of the indoor air temperature for the model validation. Fig. 14 shows the measured values of the room temperature compared to the simulated temperature curve of the grey-box model. The simulated temperature is very close to the measured temperature, with a RMSE value of 0.18 ℃. The grey-box model thus is considered to be capable to accurately describe the dynamic thermal behavior of the case study. In terms of the black box model validation, the results can be found in Fig. 15 . The solid curve represents the measured temperature of the case study on the test set, while the dotted curve represents for the predicted temperature by the black-box model. The significant deviations are mostly observed at the moment when the temperature experiences the sudden change. However, the over fitting degree is good enough, and the RMSE value is 0.21 ℃, which means the black-box model can sufficiently capture the thermal dynamics of the case study. 4.2 Room temperature regulation Figs. 16(a)\u201319(a) show the room temperature control results of the four control strategies, namely W-MPC, G-MPC, B-MPC, and RBC under the four scenarios: normal condition, control failure, extreme weather, and irregular occupancy. Figs. 16(b)\u201319(b) show the control signals during the impact time range. The results show that under various scenarios, the overall temperature curve controlled by RBC is generally higher, while the three MPC curves are close to each other and lower. The results are consistent with the consensus that the RBC is less efficient in controlling the room temperature of the buildings with higher thermal inertia such as TABS, and can easily results in the overheating issue. On the contrary, the MPC strategies take into account the economic factors, which makes it control the room temperature within a comfortable range and slightly lower. As a result, the energy cost can be efficiently reduced due to the less energy consumption and heat loss. Moreover, it is clear that the three MPC strategies show better performances when subjected to the various random uncertainties. The RBC strategy, due to the fixed strategy and lack of the predictive control capabilities, shows poorer adaptability facing the appearances of the uncertainties with the significant constraint violations. For example, when a control failure occurs, the indoor temperature controlled by RBC significantly falls below the lower temperature limit, while the temperature controlled by MPCs remains within the boundary. It can be seen from the control signals that the MPCs started the preheating in advance. Regarding the scenario due to the extreme weather, both RBC and the three MPC strategies result in a slight decrease in the indoor temperature but still remain within the temperature constraints. The indoor temperature of MPCs is in general lower to save the overall energy consumption and the corresponding cost. In terms of the uncertainty scenario due to the high occupancy, the indoor temperature dramatically rises for both RBC and MPCs. However, RBC leads to more severe violation to the upper temperature boundary. By comparing all four scenarios, it is clear that the indoor temperature controlled by RBC shows overall upward trend as the outdoor temperature increasing, the temperature curves of MPCs are more stable regardless of the outdoor climate change. Therefore, the RBC method is more likely to result in overheating issue and excessive energy consumption due to the higher operation temperature. Even the graphs of the temperature curves indicates that MPC outperforms RBC, the comparison among the MPCs is somehow still ambiguous since the temperature curves of the three MPC strategies are quite close to each other. To further quantify the strengths and weaknesses of these control strategies, the in-depth analysis of the performance indicators follows. 4.3 System performance evaluation 4.3.1 Room temperature control performance Fig. 20 (a)\u2013(b) show the results of the normalized room temperature constraint violations (a) and the normalized absolute discrepancies between the actual room temperature and the setpoint temperature (b) of the four control strategies (W-MPC, G-MPC, B-MPC, and RBC). The simulation conditions consider four uncertainty scenarios: the normal conditions, the control failure condition, the extreme weather condition, and the high occupancy condition. The results show that the three MPC strategies outperform RBC in both the normal and the uncertain scenarios. When comparing the violation of the indoor temperature constraint, MPCs reduce the normalized temperature violations by 40\u201380 %. Regarding the comparison of the three MPC strategies, W-MPC shows the best performance. The normalized temperature violation under W-MPC is 30 % and 15 % less compared to G-MPC and B-MPC. Regarding the discrepancy between the actual room temperature and the set value, the tested strategies show similar performance results. The maximum performance improvement is observed by the W-MPC, which decreases the discrepancy by 9.71 % compared to the baseline RBC. The performance improvement of G-MPC is the second optimum, which is 8.55 %. Among all the MPC strategies, W-MPC shows the least error in respect to the room temperature regulation. One possible reason could be that the W-MPC based on the high-accuracy white-box model bears the least noise impact when solving the cost function and receiving the temperature feedback. In order words, more concrete physical information is beneficial to the better performance of the controller. 4.3.2 Economic performance Table 3 and Fig. 21 respectively show the energy consumption and economy of the four control strategies in different scenarios. The results show that all three MPC strategies have better economic performances compared to RBC. The energy savings reach to 30 %\u201350 % under different scenarios. The cost saving effect of the optimal control strategies is most significant for the normal situation. The occurrence of the uncertainty events jeopardizes the cost saving effect of MPCs. Such phenomenon is most significant for the control failure scenario. To overcome the unresponsive control action, the heat pump is operated during the high-price period to provide extra heat to compensate for the indoor temperature drop, so to guarantee the comfort requirements. Among the four control strategies, G-MPC shows the optimal economic performance, followed by W-MPC with a deviation of no more than 3.87 %. The levelized energy cost of B-MPC is slightly higher compared to the other two MPCs due to the certain error in its neural network modeling, and the deviation is no more than 9.31 %, which is still 30 % less compared to RBC. 4.3.3 Energy flexibility The comparison of the energy flexibility among the four control strategies under different scenarios can be found in Fig. 22 . The results show that all three MPC strategies have more energy flexibility than RBC. 14 %\u201329 % increase of the flexibility utilization is achieved by applying MPC strategies under different scenarios. Since the objective function of the controller considers the energy cost and the indoor comfort equally, it is difficult to shift all the heat supply activities to the low-price period. Therefore, the flexibility factors of MPC strategies are less than one. However, if the weight factor q in the objective function is increased, the higher flexibility factor can be expected. Similar to the economic performance, the scenario of the control failure results in the least energy flexibility factor values. It is also due to the compensation of the indoor temperature by shifting heat supply to the high-price period. G-MPC shows the highest flexibility factor among the four control strategies, outperforming W-MPC and B-MPC by about 5 %\u201315 %. The reason might be because both W-MPC and B-MPC use genetic algorithms as their core control algorithms, and the inherent randomness in the population of the genetic algorithm process could cause this difference. 5 Discussion As mentioned in previous study [43], different layout of TABS leads to the difference in the applicable scenarios. The selection of the most convenient system for the specific application should be based on comprehensive consideration. Regarding to our study, the climate of the location of the case study is cold. The overall heating load is much more significant compared to the cooling load. According to the previous research [44], for the heating purpose, the floor-type TABS shows higher heat transfer coefficient (9.0\u201311 W/m2) compared to the wall-type TABS (8\u20139.3 W/m2) and the ceiling-type TABS (5.6\u20137.3 W/m2). Moreover, the simple installation makes it one of the most widely used TABS. While other TABS topologies also have the corresponding preferred applications. For instance, the ceiling-type TABS outperforms other TABS types for the cooling purpose. The wall-type TABS is more effective at buffering the outdoor weather variation. Given the different characteristics of different TABS types, the universal solution can hardly be achieved. And maximizing the advantages of the implemented TABS during the operation phase helps to improve the system\u2019s whole life cycle energy and economic, which can be accomplished through the optimal control strategies. And that is also the reason of analyzing different control strategies in this study. According to the evaluation results, the three MPC strategies outperform the conventional RBC within both the normal scenario and the scenarios under various uncertainties. Among the three MPCs, G-MPC is more advantageous regarding the economic performance and the energy flexibility utilization, while its control performance of maintaining the required room temperature is less effective compared to the other two strategies. In that sense, W-MPC and B-MPC are more recommended for TABS with significant building energy resilience concerning the minor differences in the energy cost savings and the load shifting capabilities. Apart from the performances, the complexity of the model establishment is also of great importance for selecting the suitable control strategy, especially for the TABS with large thermal inertia. In this study, the physical model of the building for W-MPC was established using the Dymola software based on the Modelica language for modeling. The modeling process is relatively simple with less requirement of the data for the calibration and validation, and it provides the highest model accuracy in the room temperature control. However, due to the limitations of the modeling schema, W-MPC shows very limited generalization capabilities and requires model reestablishment for different types of buildings, which leads to the substantial increase in the workload. G-MPC describes the building thermal behavior by the differential equations based on the physical principles. The accuracy of these differential equations is crucial, but too complex equations can significantly impact the computation cost. In order to improve the calculation efficiency, the model order reduction is of great importance. However, it is still missing the uniform standard that clarifies to what degree the model order reduction is enough. In terms of the identification of the grey-box model system, there is a moderate requirement for the data size of the model calibration and validation. G-MPC has good generalization capabilities within the same type of buildings, but the model may need adjustments in different scenarios. In terms of the B-MPC, extensive historical data is required for training the well-functioning model. Since the different deep-learning algorithms have distinct strengths, the selection of the most suitable algorithm can be time-consuming and labor-intensive by involving loads of comparison. However, B-MPC has strong generalization capability and adaptability. Once the data processing plan and training method are determined, it can be easily applied to different scenarios. Additionally, the computational performances of the three MPC strategies differ. The granularity of the simulation time was evaluated for the proposed MPCs. G-MPC typically finishes the calculations within a few minutes, while W-MPC and B-MPC require about 3 h. This time will be reduced with improvements in the model structure and algorithms. Another limitation of this study is the limited types of uncertainties considered, with only three types of uncertainties addressed. Moreover, to study the application performance of the model, the uncertainty events were assumed to appear at the fixed time. In reality, there are many types of uncertainties, and their occurrence is random. This issue can be overcome by coupling an uncertainty prediction module in the future. In summary, W-MPC is suitable for the situations with insufficient training data and high requirements for the control accuracy; G-MPC is suitable for the scenarios demanding fast computation and intelligibility with the moderate size of the historical data; B-MPC is suitable for cases with abundant historical data, aiming for rapid project deployment. 6 Conclusions This study develops optimal control strategies for TABS based on the white-box, grey-box, and black-box models. Considering the significant heat flexibility, as well as the thermal inertia of TABS, the performances including the control accuracy, the cost savings, and the flexibility utilization are compared among the MPC strategies and the baseline control method. Moreover, the uncertainty scenarios due to the control failure, extreme weather, and high occupancy were created for the test of the controller in addition to the normal conditions. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) With sufficient input data, the grey-box and black-box models are capable to accurately describe the dynamic thermal behavior of TABS. The RMSE value of the grey-box and black-box models are 0.18 ℃ and 0.21 ℃ respectively, which are both acceptable to couple the optimal control strategy. (2) Comparing to the RBC, the three MPC strategies show better performance for both normal and uncertainty scenarios. The prediction based control can effectively avoid the occurrence of temperature violation, and the indoor temperature is more stable on the long term regardless of the outdoor climate. The optimization objective helps save energy costs by 30 %\u201350 %, and enhance the flexibility utilization by 14 %\u201329 %. (3) In terms of the comparison among the MPC strategies, W-MPC shows the optimal performance for the room temperature control. G-MPC is more effective of reducing the energy cost and enhancing the energy flexibility. (4) This study provides detailed analysis of the control strategies for TABS with high energy flexibility. The establishment methods of different MPCs and their characterizations based on the multi-index comparisons are helpful for the design and operation of the building control system.

        "dc:description": "Thermally Activated Building Systems (TABS) has great energy flexibility potential for the effective demand response, but the inherent large thermal inertia creates challenges for the control. Model Predictive Control (MPC) can improve the control efficiency while achieving certain objectives. However, the modeling mechanism of the TABS thermal behavior can lead to the difference in the controller performances. In this study, the white-box model, grey-box model, and black-box model based MPCs (referred to as W-MPC, G-MPC, and B-MPC) are developed and analyzed in depth for a case TABS with high heat flexibility potential. The performances of MPC strategies are investigated together with the baseline Rule Based Control (RBC) strategy under normal conditions as well as a variety of uncertainty events. In general, MPC strategies show better performance compared to the RBC. The prediction-based control can effectively maintain the indoor temperature within the constraints considering the uncertain disturbances and the gradual outdoor climate change. Moreover, MPC strategies help to increase the cost savings due to the effective load shifting by 30%\u201350%, and enhance the flexible energy utilization by 14%\u201329%. In terms of the comparison among the different MPC strategies, W-MPC shows better performance in the room temperature control, which reduces the violation of the indoor temperature constraint by 30% and 15% compared to G-MPC and B-MPC, respectively. G-MPC shows slight superiority concerning the economy and flexible energy usage. The normalized cost saving of G-MPC is approximately 3% and 8% lower compared to the W-MPC and B-MPC, respectively, while the utilization efficiencies of the flexible energy are approximately 6% and 12% higher.",
