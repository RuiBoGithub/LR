The system is designed for a residence located in Algarve, Portugal. The results of the presented system are compared with the real experimental results obtained by a commercial PV-battery management system. Additionally, an analysis of the system's performance is conducted, in terms of operation planning for 2021 market prices compared to 2022 prices, where there was a significant rise of buying price due to the energy world context.

It is also responsible for about 30 % of CO2 emissions from the end-use sector when accounting for indirect emissions from the use of electricity and heat in buildings [1]. Speaking of the EU, the use of electricity to satisfy the loads of lighting and most electrical appliances represents about 14.5 % of the energy consumed in residential sector, excluding heating and cooling systems, and 24.8 % including the latter [2]. Therefore, we are in the presence of a sector that has a significant weight in the final energy consumption figures. Thus, innovative energy initiatives should contribute towards reducing energy consumption, reducing the effects on the climate, and achieving greater energy efficiency. These initiatives begin to emerge to a certain extent from small consumers, as they become more aware of environmental issues. In addition, energy markets go through a transition period and begin to give way, recognize, and promote the emerging role of prosumers [3,4]. Thus, prosumers want to have greater autonomy and greater decision-making power in the management of their energy, something previously mainly in charge of energy companies. For this, more and more people tend to purchase energy management systems for their homes, the so-called home energy management systems (HEMS). According to [5], a HEMS is a system that makes use of demand response strategies to shift periods of production and consumption of energy to more favorable periods, considering electricity prices and the comfort of the end consumer. Thus, a HEMS receives relevant information about energy production, consumption, and purchase and sale prices and makes optimal decisions that will be sent to the devices in the home. The trend is for HEMS to become more advanced and smarter, so much so that some authors already speak of smart HEMS, as it includes sensors, bidirectional communication, advanced metering infrastructure, energy storage and smart devices [6,7]. 1.1 Literature review HEMS are systems that have received great attention from the scientific community in recent years, as they are included in the context of energy efficiency, use of renewable energy sources, climate change and the development of new business models in the energy field. As the purpose of this paper is not to provide a complete review of the state of the art, only a brief review of HEMS is given. In addition, the authors recently contributed a comprehensive review of HEMS development in the recent years in [8], where HEMS techniques have been divided into 4 broad categories: traditional techniques, model predictive control, also known as model-based predictive control (MBPC), heuristics and metaheuristics, and other techniques. In [9] a complete review is made on applications of model predictive control algorithms in buildings and their ability to guarantee efficiency in heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. Furthermore, we recommend the reader to consider reading the following review papers for a more complete and diversified review [5,10\u201315]. In [16] a HEMS is presented with an algorithm that allows choosing the priority of which source to use. The presented approach allows to reduce operating costs, peak demand problem and enhance energy efficiency. In [17] the authors develop a HEMS using the model predictive control framework. The authors use the branch-and-bound algorithm. A sensitivity analysis is performed, considering different parameters, such as time-step, prediction, and control horizon. In [18] an energy management system for a domestic off-grid microgrid is developed, using the predictive control technique. The problem has multiple objectives such as minimizing comfort violations and maximizing renewable energy exploitation by reducing the use of a fuel-cell. In [19] a model predictive control approach for multi-zones building energy systems using nonlinear models is presented. The proposed approach shows good results. In [20] a stochastic model predictive control for a residential DC microgrid is presented. Chance constraints are considered in the problem where the objective is cost minimization. In [21] a HEMS is developed that includes a PV system and a battery bank, which allows applying demand response strategies, controlling the temperature of thermal appliances and the battery. Electricity costs are reduced without compromising user's comfort. In [22] a HEMS is proposed that considers thermal and electrical loads. To solve the problem, a fusion between the harmony search algorithm and the particle swarm optimization is employed. In [23] the authors propose a HEMS using deep reinforcement learning to solve the problem The residence has electrical and thermal loads, the PV system, energy storage and electric vehicles. In [24] a HEMS is developed for a smart household, formulating the problem as a MILP problem. The system considers PV production, a battery bank, electrical appliances and incorporates demand response strategies. The paper considers a sensitivity analysis on the impact of batteries and distributed generation on cost. In [25] a stochastic model predictive control is developed for the management of microgrids. The problem is formulated as a MILP problem and aims to minimize costs and reducing emissions. In [26] the authors present a HEMS system for a residential microgrid. The problem is formulated as a MILP problem. The problem considers the concept of model predictive control to reduce the effects of forecast errors. The system allows the user to reduce operating costs. A relevant technique associated with HEMS development and energy management in buildings is the demand response. In [27] a review of demand response programs focused on the residential sector is presented. Methodologies and control algorithms are discussed among other aspects. In [28] a complete analysis is presented on the influence of demand response strategies on thermal comfort and the reduction of costs for residential buildings. The objective is to reduce electricity costs without compromising thermal comfort. With the model presented, a cost reduction of up to 15 % can be verified. In [29] it is investigated as demand response strategies can reduce the energy needed for heating and electricity costs in a residential building with heat pumps and an energy storage thank system. In addition to reducing energy for heating, costs can be reduced by up to 12 %. In [30] a model for the energy management of a house is developed considering demand response. The model can adjust the loads to minimize operating costs, smooth the renewable intermittency and operate in off-grid mode. Despite the active publication in the topics of HEMS, most of papers fail to present a complete model for a real case study and a complete analysis under different conditions, where it is possible to make a comparison between experimental results and the results obtained by the proposed HEMS system. 1.2 Contributions The major contributions of this paper are as follows: 1 \u2013 The presentation of an innovative HEMS model for a real case study. Most research work in HEMS have models for fictitious cases, not referring to real cases. This work can overcome this limitation. Also, most papers propose the formulation of the problem for HEMS in the form of a nonlinear problem. This option can result in a local optimum instead of a global optimum. This work overcomes this problem by presenting a linear formulation. In addition, when using a MILP-based formulation it is possible to have greater control over control actions when using binary variables to model the states of on/off of devices; 2 \u2013 The presentation of a model for HEMS that considers the concept of model predictive control simultaneously with the MILP-based formulation. Most HEMS models that use MILP do so without an auxiliary technique to improve results. In other words, although the MILP can get good results, it has a limited field of vision, making decisions made only considering a temporal horizon initially defined. A model for HEMS considering only MILP suffers from what is called myopia, i.e., it has no possibility to update the inputs with new forecasts, see the system reaction to control actions and be able to see more ahead of each time-step. This paper overcomes this problem by presenting the MILP-based formulation along with model predictive control. This combination results in a more robust, reliable and economically more favorable operation; 3 \u2013 The validation of the proposed model for HEMS using a real system as a means of comparison. This is a gap in the literature, as most papers do not make this comparison using real data, based only on their theoretical models. The superiority of the HEMS proposed is demonstrated through several simulations, including: analysis under different seasons, such as winter and summer; analysis under different periods of future values of load power and PV power; analysis for different energy purchase and sale prices, considering Portuguese 2021 and 2022 prices. Also, to prove the reliability of the proposed model, real control actions of the experimental system are used in the model to measure the similarity. 2 Home description and data acquisition The house used as a case study for this paper is a residential building located in Faro, Algarve, Portugal [17,31\u201333]. The residence is a detached house, with a PV system and a battery bank and a set of electrical appliances. The PV system has a peak power of 6 kWp, divided by 20 Sharp NU-AK solar panels. The battery bank consists of a BYD Battery Box HV H11.5, which has a total capacity of 11.5 kWh. The inverter used is a Kostal Plenticore Plus Inverter which includes an energy management system between the PV and the battery bank [17]. This management system defines the experimental operation and will be used as a comparison object in this paper. As for energy consumption, it is acquired through a Carlo Gavazzi (EM340) 3 phase energy meter. Furthermore, the PV output and associated data are obtained from a Kostal smart meter [17,32]. Among the electrical appliances that can be controlled are the pump and the air conditioning (AC). Furthermore, the house has an intelligent weather station [34]. An IoT platform was developed to receive information about electrical appliances, process this information and transform it into useful information for decision making. A total of about 300 parameters are measured every second or every minute [17]. As required by the user, this data can be grouped into larger intervals. All the management of this large volume of data tends to guarantee a more precise and economically advantageous management for the owner of the residence. The house has an energy contract with a time-of-use pricing for the purchase of energy and the possibility of selling energy to the grid at 90 % of the average monthly price of the Iberian Electricity Market (MIBEL). Instantaneous data collected from the household can be freely accessed at [35]. 3 Problem formulation The HEMS to be developed must be able to mimic the behavior of the components of the residence described in the previous section and the events that may happen, namely the interaction with the grid, using mathematical programming techniques, to allow the optimization of the operation. Thus, in formulating the problem, the system must take into account that: 1) there is the possibility of buying and selling energy to the grid; 2) there is energy production from a PV system; 3) there is a battery bank that can only charge from the energy coming from the PV; 4) there is a flexible load that can be applied to demand management, which is the swimming pool pump; 5) there is a HVAC system which is here denoted as AC. All these considerations reveal the complexity of the problem that cannot be formulated as a purely linear programming problem. There are decisions that can be made only using binary variables, such as on/off decisions, which leads us to formulate the problem as a MILP problem. The problem is formulated as optimizing the system operation for a prediction horizon (PH) of 24 h every 15 min, through a MILP problem. More specifically, at every 15 min the HEMS system minimizes the operation costs, using information about current measurements, forecasted values of load power, and photovoltaic power, as well as energy purchase and sale prices. The MILP program delivers a sequence of controls to be applied for the 24 h PH, but, at each instant, only the first control is actually applied to the HEMS. At the next instant of time, the same process takes place. This is the receding horizon principle, which is applied in model predictive control. The operation thus benefits from the capabilities of formulating and optimizing a MILP problem allied to the concept of model predictive control that allows this constant updating of information, allowing the reduction of forecast errors, and thus obtaining a more successful operation at a technical and economic level. 3.1 Objective function Every 15 min a MILP program is generated where the objective function is to minimize operating costs for the next 24 h. (1) min ∑ k = 1 K P k Grid - π k Grid - Δ h - P k Grid + π k Grid + Δ h In (1) P k Grid - is the power purchased from the grid, P k Grid + is the power sold to grid, π k Grid - is the purchasing price, π k Grid + the selling price, and Δ h is the time interval considered, in hours. Consequently, the objective function is given by subtracting the cost of purchasing energy from the grid and the income of selling energy to the grid. 3.2 Constraints The MILP problem is subject to a set of constraints. 3.2.1 Grid interaction constraints (2) 0 ≤ P k Grid - ≤ P Grid ¯ ( 1 - v k Grid ) (3) 0 ≤ P k Grid + ≤ P Grid ¯ v k Grid In (2) and (3) P Grid ¯ is the maximum power of the interaction with the grid, i.e., the maximum power that can be bought or sold to the grid, and v k Grid is the binary variable that is responsible for the decision of buying or selling energy to the grid, ensuring that the buying and selling processes cannot occur simultaneously. Consequently, constraints (2) and (3) define the maximum values of purchasing power and selling power, respectively. 3.2.2 Battery bank constraints (4) P B + _ v k B + ≤ P k B + ≤ P B + ¯ v k B + (5) P B - _ v k B - ≤ P k B - ≤ P B - ¯ v k B - (6) v k B + + v k B - ≤ 1 (7) SoC k B = SoC k - 1 B + η B - P k B - E B ¯ Δ h - P k B + E B ¯ η B + Δ h (8) SoC B _ ≤ SoC k B ≤ SoC B ¯ (9) SoC 0 B = SoC initial B (10) P k PV , B = P k PV - P k B - (11) P k PV , B ≥ 0 (12) P k B + - P k - 1 B + ≤ R U (13) P k B - - P k - 1 B - ≤ R U (14) P k - 1 B + - P k B + ≤ R D (15) P k - 1 B - - P k B - ≤ R D In (4) and (5) P k B + and P k B - are the discharging and charging power of the battery bank, v k B + and v k B - are the binary variables for the discharging and charging processes, and P B + ¯ / P B - ¯ and P B - _ / P B - _ are the maximum discharge/charge power and minimum discharge/charge power, respectively. Consequently, (4) and (5) are the constraints for the limits of power of the battery bank. In (6), the constraint is employed to guarantee that only one of the binary variables can assume the value 1 at any time, thus imposing that the charge and discharge processes cannot occur simultaneously. In (7), SoC k B and SoC k - 1 B are the variables for the state of charge at period k and k-1, η B + / η B - are the discharge/ charge efficiency, and E B ¯ the rated energy of the battery bank. Consequently, (7) is the equation of balance of energy of the battery bank. In (8), SoC B _ / SoC B ¯ are the minimum and maximum state of charge. In (9), SoC 0 B is the initial state of charge [36,37]. In (10), P k PV is the PV power and P k PV , B an auxiliary variable to model the fact that the battery bank cannot charge from the grid. Thus, (10) together with (11) ensure that the battery charge power variable can only assume a non-zero value when there is PV production. In (12)\u2013(15) the ramp up and ramp down constraints of the battery bank are defined. 3.2.3 Swimming pool pump constraints (16) ∑ j = k k + W T - 1 v j on / o f f ≥ W T v k start - u p ∀ k = 1 ⋯ K - W T + 1 (17) P k Pump = P k Pump ¯ v k on / o f f (18) ∑ k = 1 K P k Pump = P k Pump ¯ H Pump (19) v k start - u p - v k shut - d o w n = v k on / o f f - v k - 1 on / o f f (20) v k start - u p + v k shut - d o w n ≤ 1 In (16) v j on / o f f and v k start - u p are the binary variable for the state on/off, and the binary variable for the start-up of the swimming pool pump, respectively. WT is the minimum continuous working time of the swimming pool. In (16), the constraint guarantees that the pump remains on for a period of time at least equal to the WT [37,38]. In (17), P k Pump and P k Pump ¯ are the variables for optimal power of the pump and the rated power of the pump. In (17), P k Pump can assume the value 0 or P k Pump ¯ according to state v j on / o f f . In (18), ∑ k = 1 K P k Pump is the sum of the power of the pump over the 24 h and H Pump the number of periods the pump must operate over a 24 h period. Constraint (18) guarantees that the pump operates a time predefined by the user. In (19), v k shut - d o w n is the binary variable for the shut-down of the swimming pool pump. In (19), the constraint defines the relationships between the binary variables. In (20), the constraint guarantees that in no case the variables v k start - u p and v k shut - d o w n assume the value 1 simultaneously. 3.2.4 Air conditioning constraint (21) θ k In = α θ k - 1 In + β θ k - 1 Out + γ P k AC , w i n t e r p e r i o d α θ k - 1 In + β θ k - 1 Out - γ P k AC , s u m m e r p e r i o d (22) θ In _ ≤ θ k In ≤ θ In ¯ (23) P k AC = 0.1 v k A C 1 + 0.2 v k A C 2 + 0.3 v k A C 3 + 0.4 v k A C 4 + 0.5 v k A C 5 + 0.6 v k A C 6 + 0.7 v k A C 7 + 0.8 v k A C 8 + 0.9 v k A C 9 + v k A C 10 P AC ¯ (24) 0.1 v k A C 1 + 0.2 v k A C 2 + 0.3 v k A C 3 + 0.4 v k A C 4 + 0.5 v k A C 5 + 0.6 v k A C 6 + 0.7 v k A C 7 + 0.8 v k A C 8 + 0.9 v k A C 9 + v k A C 10 ≤ 1 In (21) θ k In , θ k - 1 In , θ k - 1 Out and P k AC are the indoor temperature in period k, the indoor temperature in period k-1, the outdoor temperature in period k-1, and the air conditioning power, respectively. The coefficients α , β , γ derive from building characteristics and can be obtained by experimental results [39,40]. In (22) θ In _ and θ In ¯ are the minimum and maximum indoor temperature defined by the user over a specific period. In (23) v k A C 1 is the binary variable modeling the state on/off of 10 % of the rated power of the air conditioning P AC ¯ . In (23) the constraint discretizes the AC power in 10 parts of the rated power. In (24) the constraint guarantees that only one the 10 binary variables of the air conditioning can assume the value of 1. 3.2.5 Home energy balance constraint (25) P k PV , B + P k B + + P k Grid - = P k Grid + + P k D + P k Pump + P k AC Constraint (25) defines the energy balance in the residence. The left side of the equation reflects the energy that is available in the house and the right side reflects the energy that is taken from the house. 3.3 Flowchart of the MILP-based model predictive control The flowchart of the MILP-based model predictive control proposed for the HEMS is shown in Fig. 1 . 4 Simulations The simulations are performed at 15-minute intervals for a 24-hour time horizon, i.e., 96 simulations for one day. More specifically, 96 MILP problems are solved every 24 h and each MILP problem accounts for a total of 96 periods to emulate the following 24 h. Thus, at the end of 24 h, a new set of 96 problems is generated for the following 24 h, up to a full month. The residence has a time-of-use pricing scheme in the purchase of energy and sells energy to the grid at an amount corresponding to 90 % of the average monthly price of the day-ahead market of the MIBEL. The purchasing/selling power to the grid is limited to a value of 7.3 kW. The battery charge/discharge efficiency is 0.9. The maximum charge/discharge power is 5.5 kW. The capacity of the battery is 11.2 kWh. The rate of increase/decrease of battery power from one instant to the next, i.e., the values referring to the ramp constraints, is 4 kW. The rated power of the pump is 0.85 kW. The swimming pool pump must operate a total of 7 h each day. The rated power of AC is 1.41 kW. For the AC coefficients, the values of [α; β; γ] = [0.86;0.14;2.77] for winter and [α; β; γ] = [0.92;0.14;2.77] for summer are considered. The user has the option of defining the hours at which the AC is heated/cooled and what temperature value he wants for the desired time interval. The model is implemented in MATLAB 2021a and the problem solved by the intlinprog solver of the MATLAB optimization toolbox that solves MILP problems, using a 3.7 GHz processor with 32 GB of RAM. The PV power for the months of January 2022 and June 2022 [35] are shown in Fig. 2 . Fig. 2 shows, as expected, that there is greater photovoltaic production during the month of June, a summer month where there is typically greater radiation. The power demand for the months of January 2022 and June 2022 [35] are shown in Fig. 3 . Fig. 3 shows, as expected, that there is greater energy consumption in the winter month, due to greater energy needs. The purchase and sell prices for the months of January and June of 2021 and 2022 are shown in Fig. 4 . Fig. 4 left shows that prices for the time-of-use pricing scheme in off-peak periods increased from 2021 to 2022 and that prices in peak periods decreased. Fig. 4 right shows that energy sales prices, corresponding to 90 % of the MIBEL day-ahead market price, increased more than 3 times when comparing January 2021 and 2022 and more than 2 times when comparing June 2021 and 2022 prices. These large price variations can imply significant differences in an optimization problem. 4.1 Analysis of the interaction with the grid: Experimental vs HEMS controlling only interaction with grid vs HEMS controlling interaction with grid/battery/pump/AC This case study analyzes the impact on the power that is bought and sold to the grid and on the costs of considering the HEMS developed, compared with the results of the management system existing in the residence. Additionally, it also intends to analyze the impacts of using different configurations of the HEMS, namely: a HEMS controlling only the interconnection with the grid (without energy storage), and a HEMS including the management of the interconnection with the grid, battery, pump, and AC. This case study considers data of the residence from January 2022, and prices of January 2021 and January 2022. The purchasing (negative) and selling (positive) energy for experimental and different configurations of HEMS considering prices of 2021 are shown in Fig. 5 . Fig. 5 shows that the experimental system and the HEMS controlling interaction with grid/battery/pump/AC are conservative, not selling energy to the grid, due to the unfavorable energy selling prices of January 2021. Therefore, it is better to store the produced energy in the battery and then supply the loads with this energy, than to purchase energy from the grid at a high price. On the contrary, HEMS controlling only the interaction with grid must buy all the energy from the grid to satisfy the loads, and in the other situations sell the remaining energy to the grid at a lower price. The purchasing and selling energy for experimental and different configurations of HEMS considering prices of 2022 are shown in Fig. 6 . Fig. 6 shows that the experimental HEMS is still conservative, not selling energy to the grid, while the optimization problem developed to the HEMS recommends selling energy to the grid in large quantities, either when HEMS only controls the interconnection with the grid or when it manages the interconnection with the grid and the devices presented in the formulation, due to the favorable energy sale price. Also, when the HEMS has full control, a total net value of \u2013 1569 kWh in the purchase/sale of energy is verified, while when the HEMS only controls the interconnection with the grid, a net value of \u2013 1602 kWh in the purchase/sale is verified. The operation costs for experimental and for different HEMS configurations are shown in Table 1 . Table 1 shows that having an effective management system can provide significant cost savings. The HEMS controlling only the interaction with grid as it cannot store energy has to buy all the energy to the grid at a high price and sell energy to the grid at a low price when considering the 2021 prices, which is reflected in the operation cost, with an increase of 40 % in relation to the experimental one. When considering the 2022 prices, HEMS controlling only the interaction with grid buys and sells the same quantity, but with significantly different prices, which guarantees a reduction of \u201328 % in costs compared to the experimental one. The reduction in operating costs can reach \u20137% and 30 % when a HEMS capable of managing the interconnection with the grid, battery, pump and AC is developed, considering prices of 2021 and prices of 2022, respectively. Thus, the results show the superiority of the proposed HEMS compared to the management system present in the residence. Also, the HEMS controlling interaction with grid/battery/pump/AC proves to be more effective with both 2021 and 2022 prices, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the developed HEMS. 4.2 Analysis of the residence for winter period: prices of 2021 vs prices of 2022 This case study analyzes the behavior of the residence in the winter period, more specifically in the month of January 2022. The case study compares the results obtained by the experimental and the HEMS developed under different conditions of purchase and sale prices of energy, i.e., considering 2021 and 2022 prices and their impact on residential operation planning. Furthermore, the case study compares the results using different schemes for the future 24 h data (load consumption and PV produced) needed for the proposed HEMS scheme. In the last section we assumed available, at every time instant, the future values of this data. 1 1 In future publications, insted of using measured data, forecasted values will be assumed. Here, we shall use, in the first period of the 24 h measured values, and in the second period naïve forecasted values, i.e., values obtained 24 h before. Four different 24-hour data configurations will be considered: 1) 9 h of available future data plus 15 h of naïve forecasted data; 2) 12 h of available future data plus 12 h of naïve forecasted data; 3) 18 h of available future data plus 6 h of naïve forecasted data; and 4) 24 h of data available. For the sake of space, only configurations 1) and 4) will be used for figures. An analysis of the main decision variables of the problem as well as the obtained operating costs is also performed. The purchasing and selling energy for experimental and different configurations of HEMS for winter period considering prices of January 2021 and January 2022 are shown in Fig. 7 . Notice that the bottom figures are reproductions of Fig. 5) and 6) left, and shown here for comparison purposes. Fig. 7 show that whether for 9 h or 24 h availability of future data, when considering the prices of 2021, the recommendation is that the interaction with the grid be kept at a minimum, since the energy purchase prices are expensive, and the energy sale prices are low. When considering the prices of 2022, the recommendation is for the interaction with the grid to improve, particularly in the sale of energy to the grid, since the prices of energy sales to the grid are high, and the optimization problem suggests taking advantage of the photovoltaic production to supply the loads and the rest to inject all into the grid. The charging (positive) and discharging (negative) power of the battery bank for experimental and different configurations of HEMS for winter period considering prices of January 2021 and January 2022 are shown in Fig. 8 . The state of charge of the battery bank for experimental and different configurations of HEMS for winter period considering prices of January 2021 and January 2022 are shown in Fig. 9 . Fig. 8 together with Fig. 9 show that, for both 9 h and 24 h, with the 2021 price, the recommendation is that there is a greater flow of energy to charge or discharge the battery bank, due to the high purchase prices and low sales prices, which recommends prudence to avoid incurring high costs. On the contrary, when considering 2022 prices, the recommendation of the optimization problem is practically not to use the battery, due to the fact that energy sales prices are high, so practically all the energy produced must be sold to take advantage of favorable prices. This near inactivity causes the state of charge to be practically always at the minimum level. It is important to remember that one of the constraints of the problem is that the battery cannot charge from the grid. The power of the swimming pool pump for experimental and different configurations of HEMS for the winter period considering prices of January 2021 and January 2022 are shown in Fig. 10 . Fig. 10 shows that for the experimental, the pump operation is indicated to occur from 24 h to 7 h, which corresponds to a time interval within the off-peak period of the time-of-use pricing scheme. Whether for 9 h or 24 h, for 2021 prices, on some days, the pump operation is recommended, due to the optimization problem, to be shifted to periods of the day corresponding to peak periods, thus avoiding buying energy from the grid at dawn and thus supplying the pump energy with energy produced by the PV system. On the contrary, for 2022 prices, the recommendation of the optimization problem is to keep the pump operation always in off-peak periods to release energy during the day and thus sell all the energy produced by the PV system to the grid at high prices, reducing this way the operating costs. To present in detail what is said in the analysis of Fig. 9, the results for the pump operation for two days from January 2022 for 24 h are shown in Fig. 11 . The power of the air conditioning and the indoor temperature for experimental and different configurations of HEMS for winter period considering prices of January 2021 and January 2022 are shown in Fig. 12. Fig. 12 shows that the air conditioning is used in the house for 4 days during the month of January 2022. The days and period of operation of the air conditioning were determined by the user. The air conditioning model and the optimization problem show to be able to comply with the schedules predefined by the user, regardless of prices, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the developed HEMS. The operation costs for experimental and for different HEMS configurations are shown in Table 2 . Table 2 shows that for all HEMS configurations, whether for 2021 or 2022 prices, the use of an effective management system such as the developed HEMS provides a reduction in operating costs. For January 2021 prices, although there is a cost reduction of up to about 7 % compared to the experimental one, the fact that the energy sale price is only \u20ac0.054/kWh does not allow this reduction to be even greater. For January 2022 prices, the cost reduction can reach 30 %, a significant reduction, because of sales prices of \u20ac0.181/kWh. Regarding the use of the different periods of naïve forecasting, the cost reductions are slightly higher when no forecasting is used, but do not differ much for the different cases considered. 4.3 Analysis of the residence for summer period: Prices of 2021 vs prices of 2022 This case study analyzes the behavior of the residence in the summer period, more specifically in the month of June 2022. It is important to make the same analysis for a summer month because there are important differences such as the fact that the days are longer and that there is more radiation. The purchasing and selling energy for experimental and different configurations of HEMS for summer period considering prices of June 2021 and June 2022 are shown in Fig. 13 . Fig. 13 shows that, either for 9 h or 24 h, when considering the 2021 prices, the optimization problem as the experimental one suggests not selling so much energy to the grid, since the energy purchase prices are expensive, and the energy sales prices are low. For 2022 prices, in addition to an increase in energy sales to the grid to take advantage of high sales prices, there is an increase in energy purchases from the grid in certain periods, because there is the certainty of selling a greater amount of energy to the grid at an even higher price. The charging (positive) and discharging (negative) power of the battery bank for experimental and different configurations of HEMS for summer period considering prices of June 2021 and June 2022 are shown in Fig. 14 . The state of charge of the battery bank for experimental and different configurations of HEMS for summer period considering prices of June 2021 and June 2022 are shown in Fig. 15 . Fig. 14 together with Fig. 15 show that, either for 9 h or for 24 h, with the prices of 2021, both for the experimental and for the proposed HEMS it is recommended to make use of the battery bank to supply the demand of energy, due to high energy purchase prices and low energy sales prices. On the contrary, for 2022 prices, the optimization problem decides to significantly reduce the use of the battery, because energy sales prices are high, so these favorable prices suggest to inject a large part of the energy produced into the grid. The power of the swimming pool pump for experimental and different configurations of HEMS for summer period considering prices of June 2021 and June 2022 are shown in Fig. 16 . Fig. 16 shows that the pump operation for the experimental case is set for the period from 9 h to 16 h, to take advantage of the excess PV production in the summer during the day. The same is decided by the optimization problem, either for 9 h or for 24 h configurations, for 2021 prices. However, using 2022 prices, it is decided by the optimization problem to transfer the pump operation to the off-peak period of the time-of-use pricing scheme, as it is economically more favorable to sell most of the energy produced by the PV to the grid, taking advantage of the high energy sales prices. To present in detail what is said in the analysis of Fig. 15, the results for the pump operation for two days from June 2022 for 24 h are shown in Fig. 17 . The power of the air conditioning and the indoor temperature for experimental and different configurations of HEMS for winter period considering prices of June 2021 and June 2022 are shown in Fig. 18 . Fig. 18 shows that the air conditioning is used in the house for 7 days during the month of June 2022. The days and periods of operation of the air conditioning were decided by the user. Once again, the AC model and the optimization problem show to be able to comply with the schedules predefined by the user, regardless of prices, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the developed HEMS. The operation costs for experimental and for different HEMS configurations are shown in Table 3 . Table 3 shows that, unlike January 2022, for June 2022, the operation results in a negative cost, i.e., a profit, due to the high radiation energy in June and lower energy consumption. For 2021 prices, an increase in profit of up to 12 % can be observed, while for 2022 prices this increase can reach 40 % over the experimental one. For 2021 prices, the increase in profit is smaller because the energy sales price to the grid is only \u20ac0.075/kWh, while for 2022 prices, the increase is greater due to the energy sales prices to the grid of \u20ac0.153/kWh. 4.4 Analysis of the reliability of the proposed MILP-based model predictive control To prove the reliability of the proposed model predictive control, the analysis of one of the most important variables in the system, the state of charge, is presented. For this analysis the real control actions implemented in the experiment are used as model, namely the states of charge/discharge. Thus, in the model, the variables of the state of charge or discharge are replaced by inputs, with values 0 or 1. The state of charge obtained by the experiment and for the MILP-based model predictive control employing real experimental control actions is shown in Fig. 19 . Fig. 19 shows that by imposing the real control actions on the proposed model, the state of charge obtained is very similar to the experimental state of charge, which proves the system's reliability. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between the experimental and simulated state of charge is only 0.085. 4.5 Statistical analysis of the results A statistical analysis, using The Wilcoxon rank sum test, for a level of significance of 0.05 %, is performed to assess if the proposed MBPC has a behavior superior to the experimental one in the management of the operation. Simulations are performed using purchase/sell prices of January and June 2021 and 2022. The analysis is first performed individually for 9 h (+15 h), 12 h (+12 h), 18 (+6h) and 24 h. Then, the analysis is done jointly for all 9 h, 12 h, 18 h, and 24 h cases. For example, for 9 h a joint statistical analysis is performed for prices of January 2021, January 2022, June 2021, and June 2022. The results of the test, in terms of the rejection of the null hypothesis (h = 1) and p-value obtained from the statistical hypothesis test considering individual analysis are shown in Table 4 . Table 4 shows that in the results of the individual statistical analysis only the case of 9 h for January 2021, among the 16 different cases, obtains a value of h = 0, not rejecting the hypothesis of equal means between the experimental and the proposed HEMS. The values of h and p-value obtained from the statistical hypothesis test considering joint analysis are shown in Table 5 . Table 5 shows that in the results of the jointly statistical analysis for all periods, 9 h, 12 h, 18 h and 24 h, h is always equal to 1, showing that in all cases it can be stated that the proposed HEMS is better than the existing one. Thus, it is possible to conclude statistically that the approach proposed for the HEMS with the MILP-based model predictive control is better than the approach used by the commercial management system present in the residence. 5 Discussion Over the years, a significant number of research works have been done on the topic of HEMS, considering different techniques. However, there is a limitation in the literature regarding the number of studies on HEMS that present real cases as case studies. One of the reasons may be the lack of real projects or real-time access to operating values, namely the instantaneous power of the devices. As mentioned before, this paper presents an approach capable of simulating a real case study, having real data available to make an effective comparison between the real experimental results and the results of the new technique. In many cases, many simulations are performed to show the effectiveness of the models presented. However, most papers fail to present a statistical analysis of the large volume of simulations performed and thus be able to substantiate with greater rigor the superiority of their approached. This paper makes a complete statistical analysis that proves the superiority of the presented technique over experimental results. The limitations of this paper are related to the assumptions considered and are as follows: 1) the consideration that there is perfect knowledge about the instantaneous power of the devices and the whole house, as well as about the consumer's preferences, namely about the comfort temperature range and the respective hours of house heating/cooling; 2) the use of real data for the first period of the future values of the power of the PV system and the load, which implies that these values are not predicted; 3) the assumption of perfect knowledge about the monthly average price of the MIBEL day-ahead market. Thus, in a future work, the following improvements can add value to this work, respectively: 1) estimate in real-time the operation status of relevant appliances, as well as their consumption using a NILM approach[41]; 2) forecast the first part of future values of the PV system power and load (the first nine hours) using robust forecasting methods; 3) consider using MIBEL\u2019s day-ahead market prices as an estimate for the monthly value. 6 Conclusion This paper addressed the development of an efficient HEMS for a real case study. The house under study is composed of a PV system, batteries, and electrical appliances, some of which can be controlled. The house has its own commercial management system installed for PV-battery management, allowing comparison with the developed HEMS. The HEMS model is developed as a MILP problem, simultaneously using the model predictive control concept. Such a model guarantees greater robustness for a HEMS system. A comparative analysis is made between the experimental results and the HEMS results for different case studies, namely for the summer period and for the winter period, for different energy purchase and sale prices and for different periods of available future data. In all case studies, the developed HEMS presents superior results, showing the effectiveness of the model. Furthermore, the results show that the consideration of different energy purchase and sale prices can have a large impact on operation planning and costs for the prosumer. The summer results are superior to those of the winter: in summer, a profit increase of more than 40 % can be achieved and in winter a cost reduction of about 30 % compared to the experimental one, when considering 2022 prices. Also, the simulations performed analyze the behavior of the HEMS system developed under different operating conditions and different parameters of the HEMS model. The results show that it is possible to consider shorter forecast horizons such as 9 h plus 15 h of naïve forecasting to generate results as good as a 24-hour forecast, using the MILP-based model predictive control. A statistical analysis is carried out to assess whether there really are statistical differences in economic terms in using the experimental system or the developed HEMS and the results allow to conclude, statistically, that the presented HEMS is a reliable system both at an economic level and at an operation planning level.

        "dc:description": "This paper addresses the development of an innovative home energy management system (HEMS). The presented HEMS relies on a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP)-based model predictive control. The system takes advantage of the powerful formulation capabilities of a MILP-based mathematical programming problem with the capabilities of model predictive control to optimize, at each sample instant the HEMS operation using a receding-horizon formulation. The system is designed for a residence located in Algarve, Portugal. The results of the presented system are compared with the real experimental results obtained by a commercial PV-battery management system. Additionally, an analysis of the system's performance is conducted, in terms of operation planning for 2021 market prices compared to 2022 prices, where there was a significant rise of buying price due to the energy world context. In all simulations performed, it is verified that the MILP-based model predictive control presents better results, with statistical relevance.",
