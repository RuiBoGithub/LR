Acquiring actual data for developing data-based prediction models for the optimization of control setpoints (hereinafter referred to as optimal control (OC)) in heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems is challenging, especially when changing control setpoints while considering all possible boundary conditions. Thus, considering the scalability of OC, it is a promising solution to generate sufficient learning data according to the control settings using a highly accurate simulation model, build a source model, and expand the learning model based on the actual data of the target system. This is the first study to improve the scalability of OC aiming to develop a deep neural network (DNN) model to predict the power consumption of a heat source system. First, this study will construct a calibrated heat source system simulation model and then use the generated learning data to train a DNN model. The actual operation conditions of the target building and heating system located in Vietnam were analyzed using operation data. A physics-based simulation model of the target heat source system was developed and calibrated using actual operation data to improve accuracy. By using the calibrated simulation, sufficient learning data was generated for all control settings allowing for the development of a learning model based on DNN that predicted the power consumption of the heat source system. In addition, a highly accurate prediction model through hyperparameter optimization was secured.

The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 caused a temporary decline in GHG emissions, but they have since risen as restrictions have eased and economic activity has resumed, with global primary energy consumption in 2022 up about 17 % compared to pre-pandemic levels [1]. This trend is also apparent in South Korea. GHG emissions in South Korea decreased by 6.5 % in 2020 compared to the previous year (2019) to 656.2 million metric tons due to the impact of the pandemic. However, emissions rebounded in 2021 to 676.9 million metric tons [2]. GHG emissions are expected to decrease by 3.5 % in 2022 compared to 2021 [3]. However, this is still insufficient to meet the 40 % reduction target by 2030 compared to 727.6 million metric tons in 2018 [4]. To meet the target, an annual reduction of 5.4 % is required from 2022 onwards. The building sector accounts for 7 % of direct GHG emissions and 24.6 % of direct and indirect emissions in South Korea. This trend is expected to continue due to the increasing size and height of buildings [5]. To address this problem, continual efforts have been made to reduce GHG emissions from buildings. In particular, energy-saving measures for heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, which account for 40 % of building energy consumption, are essential [6]. As one of the measures for energy saving in HVAC systems, research on control optimization based on prediction models has been actively conducted. According to previous studies, implementing control optimization based on prediction models can reduce energy consumption and operating costs by 7 % to 50 % [7]. While the energy-saving effects vary greatly depending on existing control and operating conditions, prediction model-based control optimization is useful as it can achieve high energy-saving effects through control sophistication without replacing equipment. HVAC systems are highly complex and nonlinear. The thermal inertia of buildings, combined with the interactions of subsystems, makes it difficult to accurately predict energy consumption. As a result, a reliable prediction model is essential for optimizing energy efficiency and reducing operating costs. Generally, energy consumption prediction models used in HVAC systems are largely categorized into two types: physics-based and data-based [8]. A detailed understanding of the operating principles of the equipment and the relevant physics are required to develop a physics-based prediction model based on the First Law of Thermodynamics [9]. Furthermore, to accurately predict the performance of the equipment under various conditions, detailed specifications of the heat transfer components and performance data are required. However, most manufacturers only provide data for specific boundary conditions, which limits the accuracy of the model's predictions under other conditions. Developing precise models requires measuring actual operation data and calibrating parameters based on it. Thus, this process requires considerable time and effort [7]. In contrast, data-based methods use various prediction models, such as support vector machines (SVM), artificial neural networks (ANN), and random forest (RF), to learn the relationship between input and output data and make predictions. Thus, a model that can predict complex interactions using various variables can be developed and derive high prediction accuracy without judgment or calibration work that requires expertise and knowledge [10]. Recently, the adoption of building energy management systems (BEMS) has been on the rise in buildings aiming to improve energy efficiency, making it possible to obtain operation and energy data on building facilities, such as HVAC, ventilation, and lighting systems, leading to increased use. However, data-based methods have the problem that the quality and quantity of the data limit their prediction accuracy. For example, for new buildings, even if a BEMS is installed, it can be difficult to obtain sufficient data due to the short data storage period [11]. Prediction accuracy using data-based methods is also lower as they are dependent on past data. In most buildings, the control settings of HVAC systems are selected based on the maximum cooling load calculated during building design or by the experience of the building manager. Therefore, the HVAC system is operated at the same value throughout the year. Developing data-based prediction models for the optimization of control settings (hereinafter referred to as optimal control (OC)) in HVAC systems requires data collection over a long period with varying control settings. However, in reality, few buildings offer such opportunities. Most previous studies on OC using data-based methods have focused on the optimization of parameters to derive high prediction accuracy. However, few studies have been conducted to supplement learning data, which are difficult to collect or are insufficient quantity. This is due to the fact that most studies are conducted in simulations, which allows for the acquisition of operation data under various boundary conditions and control settings [8,9,11]. However, when building prediction models based on actual data, it may be difficult to obtain valid data [12,17]. Lee et al. [13] proposed a method for minimizing energy consumption in chilled water systems using a hybrid optimization algorithm that combined an energy simulation program and the Hooke-Jeeves algorithm. The accuracy of the target system simulation using the energy simulation program EnergyPlus was less than 10 % hourly mean bias error, satisfying the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Guideline 14. The results of the effectiveness verification for chilled water and cooling water supply temperature optimization showed an energy-saving effect of 9.5 % to 11.1 %. Sun et al. [14] developed an OC method for the chilled water temperature of a constant-speed air-cooled water chiller air conditioning systems based on a general regression neural network (GRNN) prediction model and evaluated the energy-saving potential through simulation. Their study developed a building simulation model using the Modelica library and obtained simulation data (outdoor air temperature and humidity, solar radiation, chilled water supply temperature, chilled water return temperature, input power, chilled water flow rate, indoor temperature, and FCU input power) under different partial load conditions to acquire settings required for optimization, linking ambient and operating parameters. Simulation results showed that the OC of the chiller inlet chilled water temperature reduced the energy consumption of the entire system by about 11 %. Lee et al. [15] conducted an OC study on condenser water temperature and the air handling unit discharge air temperature for water-cooled air conditioning systems. A simulation model of a general office building and the target HVAC system was developed based on EnergyPlus, and a deep neural network (DNN) learning model based on MATLAB was used to study the effectiveness of OC. The energy-saving rate of a prediction model-based OC algorithm through the co-simulation of two platforms was also evaluated. The algorithm was operated in a way that increased the exhaust air temperature and lowered the condenser water temperature, showing an energy-saving rate of about 16 %. Cho et al. [16] used a reinforced learning (RL) algorithm that combined DNN and Q-learning to improve the practicality of control strategies for buildings using geothermal heat pumps and ice-thermal energy storage cooling systems. A physics-based simulation model was developed by dividing the target system into multiple modules. Learning data was acquired by the simulation, and created a DNN learning model, which was used as an agent of RL. An agent of RL and decision trees reduced operation time from 18 h to 7 h, resulting in a 21.1 % energy saving. This was achieved with a relatively simple control method. Kang et al. (17) developed an algorithm based on an ANN to optimize chilled water temperature and cooling water temperature for central HVAC systems and applied the algorithm to an actual building to verify its energy-saving effect. Actual operation data was collected over one month as learning data for developing the ANN model. Learning data was obtained for various control settings by operating the system with varied settings the control settings of chilled water temperature and cooling water temperature during data collection the period. However, it was found that the ANN model predicted abnormal values that deviated from the general performance trend due to the lack of training data while analyzing the energy-saving effects. These prediction errors may lead to the counterintuitive effect of increased energy consumption. Lu et al. [18] conducted a bibliometric analysis of 324 publications on the use of ANNs for building energy prediction over the past five years. Three issues and main challenges in building energy prediction using ANNs, including choosing ANN architecture, improving prediction performance, and dealing with the lack of building energy data, were addressed. It was found that transfer learning is a promising solution to the problem of insufficient training data. However, it is important to secure extensive learning data for the model to be successful. As mentioned above, it is difficult to acquire actual data collected with changing control setpoints for all boundary conditions to develop data-based prediction models for OC. Thus, considering the scalability of OC, it is a promising solution to generate sufficient learning data according to the control settings using a highly accurate simulation model, build a source model, and expand the learning model using transfer learning based on the actual data of the target system. This is the first study to improve the scalability of OC, which aims to build a calibrated heat source system simulation model and develop a source model based on the learning data generated from it. First, this study will construct a calibrated heat source system simulation model and then use the generated learning data to train a DNN model. A physics-based simulation model of the target heat source system was developed and calibrated using actual operation data to improve accuracy. By using the calibrated simulation, sufficient learning data was generated for all control settings allowing for the development of a learning model based on DNN that predicted the power consumption of the heat source system. In addition, a highly accurate prediction model through hyperparameter optimization was secured. 2 Target system and operating conditions 2.1 Target buildings and HVAC system The target building, located in Hanoi, Vietnam, was completed in December 2022. It is an office building with small retail shops, restaurants, offices, auditoriums, a server room, and external meeting rooms. The building has three basement levels and 16 above-ground levels, with a total floor area of 79,511 m2. The HVAC system employs a central air conditioning system with water-cooled turbo chillers. The heat source system consists of four turbo chillers, four open circuit cooling towers, four primary chilled water pumps, four secondary chilled water pumps, and four cooling water pumps, including one spare. The equipment specifications are summarized in Table 1 . The turbo chiller uses the refrigerant R-514a, has a rated cooling capacity of 2,461 kW, and a rated power consumption of 402.4 kW. The chilled water pumps consist of primary pumps that handle the chilled water circulation on the heat source side and secondary pumps that handle the chilled water circulation on the building side. The rated flow rates of the primary and secondary chilled water pumps are 422.0 m3/h and 194.4 m3/h, respectively. They are equipped with inverters for variable flow control. The cooling tower has a rated cooling capacity of 4,077 kW and is equipped with three constant-speed fans with an airflow rate of 312,000 m3/h. The cooling water pump has a rated flow rate of 729.7 m3/h and is equipped with an inverter for variable flow control. The control specifications of the heat source system are as follows: - The control of the number of equipment in operation: The number of chillers in operation is determined by the building manager based on outdoor air conditions, building operation status, and chilled water supply temperature. The primary chilled water pump, cooling water pump, and cooling tower operate at the same number as the chillers. - The control of the number of cooling tower fans in operation: If the cooling tower outlet cooling water temperature is higher than 2 °C above the setpoint, an additional fan is started, and if the cooling tower outlet cooling water temperature is lower than 2 °C below the setpoint, one fan is stopped. The minimum number of fans in operation is one. - The control of cooling water pump flow: A proportional-integral (PI) controller is used to adjust the frequency of the cooling water pump, which in turn controls the flow rate of the cooling water. This ensures that the temperature difference of the cooling water at the inlet and outlet of the cooling tower reaches the setpoint. Considering the minimum cooling water flow rate of the chiller, the range of the frequency control of the cooling water pump was set to 65 % to 100 %. - Flow rate of the primary chilled water pump: The flow rate is controlled by adjusting the frequency using PI control so that the differential pressure between the supply water header and the return water header reaches the setpoint. Considering the minimum chilled water flow rate of the chiller, the range of the frequency control of the primary chilled water pump was set to 70 % to 100 %. - The control of the number of secondary chilled water pumps in operation and flow rate: The secondary chilled water pump regulates the flow rate using a combination of PI control and the number of operating pumps to ensure that the HVAC end differential pressure reaches the setpoint. The range of the frequency control of the secondary chilled water pump was set to 70 % to 90 %. 2.2 Operating status of the heat source system For the analysis of the operation status of the heat source system, operation data from June 19, 2023 to June 24, 2023 was used as representative data. The results are shown in Figs. 1 to 3 . As shown in Fig. 1, the outdoor air temperature (T_ao) was measured by a temperature sensor installed in an instrument shelter on the roof of the building. The total cooling load (Q_total) was calculated using the temperature difference between the supply and return headers and the flow rate of the chilled water. The outdoor air temperature ranged from 25 °C to 37 °C, with a significant temperature difference between day and night. The total cooling load varied between 1,000kWh and 4,000kWh. The maximum load occurred mainly between 5:00 AM and 6:00 AM, when the HVAC system was started. Although the outside air temperature rose rapidly during the daytime working hours, but the load did not fluctuate much. The load significantly decreased after work hours at 6:00 PM, and the HVAC system was turned off between 9:00 PM and 10:00 PM. Fig. 2 shows the cooling tower outlet cooling water temperature (CWS), its setpoint (CWS_set), and the number of cooling tower fans (CT fan) in operation. Fig. 3 shows the temperature difference of the cooling water at the inlet and outlet of the cooling tower (Diff_CWS), its setpoint (Diff_set), and the cooling water pump frequency (frequency). During this period, two chillers were operated alternately. The figure shows the operating status of the primarily operated chiller, as well as the cooling tower and cooling water pump connected to it. As shown in Fig. 2, the cooling tower outlet cooling water temperature setpoint is continuously operated at a fixed value set by the manager, even though the outdoor air temperature and the cooling load change in a time dependent manner. The cooling water temperature was maintained within the \u201cset value ±2 °C\u201d range, and the three cooling tower fans were continuously running. Fig. 3 also verifies that the temperature difference of the cooling water at the inlet and outlet of the cooling tower was set at 2 °C by the manager and was operated without any changes. The failure of the cooling water temperature difference to reach the setpoint was confirmed to be caused by improper gain tuning of the PI controller. As can be seen from the operating status of the target heat source system, the system is operating at a constant value without changing the control setpoint. Therefore, it is not possible to obtain valid operation data necessary for the development of a learning model for OC. To solve these issues, this study aims to develop a high-fidelity physics-based simulation model and generate high-quality learning data for various boundary conditions and setpoints. This data will be used to develop a learning model for OC. 3 Development of heat source system simulation to generate learning data This section describes a simulation of the target heat source system to generate the initial learning data required to build a DNN model. Fig. 4 shows the flow chart of the simulation. The left and right sides of the flow chart display the input and output values, respectively. The simulation calculates the power consumption of each piece of equipment by inputting heat source load, operation unit number of chiller, the outside air wet bulb temperature, the cooling tower outlet cooling water temperature, and the temperature difference of the cooling water at the inlet and outlet of the cooling tower, which are control settings. After developing individual equipment models for turbo chillers, cooling water pumps, and cooling towers, as well as control models for cooling water flow control and cooling tower fan flow control, a heat source system simulation was developed by connecting these models. The turbo chiller model was developed based on the performance curve showing the relationship of power consumption according to the chiller's cooling load, cooling water temperature, and the theories of the refrigeration cycle. The chiller's performance curve equation is presented in Eqs. (1), and the equation for calculating the chiller outlet cooling water temperature based on the refrigeration cycle theory is presented in Eqs. (2). (1) Power chiller = a 0 + a 1 Â · Q + a 2 Â · Q 2 + a 3 Â · T CW , i n + a 4 Â · T CW , i n 2 + a 5 Â · Q Â · T CW , i n (2) T CW , o u t = C chiller Â · Q + Power chiller m Â · c + T CW , i n here, Power chiller refers to the chiller power consumption (kW), Q refers to the chiller cooling load (kW), T CW , i n refers to the chiller inlet cooling water temperature (°C), T CW , o u t refers to the chiller outlet cooling water temperature (°C), m refers to the cooling water flow rate (kg/h), c refers to the specific heat of water (kJ/(kg·K)), a 0 a 5 refers to the performance curve parameter (−), and C chiller refers to the calibration coefficient (−). The inputs of the chiller model are the cooling load, the chiller inlet cooling water temperature, and the cooling water flow rate. The output of the model are the chiller power consumption and the chiller outlet cooling water temperature. The cooling load was calculated using the temperature difference of the chilled water at the inlet and outlet of the chiller and the flow rate of the chilled water pump. The performance curve parameters ( a 0 a 5 ) and the calibration coefficient ( C chiller ) for improving the accuracy of the chiller outlet cooling water temperature were calculated by the least-squares method using operation data acquired from April 1, 2023, to September 5, 2023, at 20-minute intervals, and the results are presented in Table 2 . Here, The chiller power consumption was measured using a power meter. The prediction accuracy of the chiller power consumption is 0.94 of R2 and a coefficient of variation (CV) of root mean squared error (RMSE) of 6.3 %. The prediction accuracy of the chiller outlet cooling water temperature is 0.99 of R2 with a CV (RMSE) of 0.74 %. The cooling tower is a counterflow type, with the cooling water and outside air flowing in opposite directions. The filler used is a film type. The cooling tower model equations are presented in Eqs. (3) to (5) [19]. Eqs. (3) presents the calculation formula for the heat transfer rate of a cooling tower. Eqs. (4) presents the experimental formula for the coefficient of mass transfer of the film-type filler in a counterflow cooling tower. Eqs. (5) provides the calculation formula for the logarithmic enthalpy difference.

The input parameters of the cooling tower model are the cooling tower inlet cooling water temperature, cooling water flow rate, cooling tower fan flow rate, and outdoor air temperature and humidity. The output parameters are the cooling tower power consumption and the cooling tower outlet cooling water temperature. The calibration coefficient ( C CT ) for improving the accuracy of the cooling tower cooling power consumption and the cooling tower outlet cooling water temperature prediction was calculated using the least squares method using the operation data acquired from April 1, 2023, to September 5, 2023, at 20-minute intervals. Due to the malfunction of the power meter, the cooling tower power consumption was estimated by multiplying operation unit number of cooling tower fans by the rated power consumption of each fan. The calculation results exhibited that C CT was 0.85 and the accuracy of the cooling tower outlet cooling water temperature prediction was 0.83 of R2 and a CV (RMSE) of 2.7 %. The cooling water pump model calculates the power consumption of the pump using the relationship formula between the shaft power and the flow rate. The pump model equation is presented in Eqs. (6). (6) Power pump = Power pump , r a t e d η Pump Â · m rated Â · f m rated 3 here, Power pump refers to the pump power consumption [kW], Power pump , r a t e d refers to the pump-rated power consumption [kW], η Pump refers to the pump efficiency [-], f refers to the pump frequency output [-], and m rated refers to the pump-rated flow rate [m3/s]. The input values of the cooling water pump model are the pump's rated power consumption, pump efficiency, and rated flow rate. The output value is the cooling water pump's power consumption. As the power consumption of the cooling water pump was not measured, the accuracy could not be verified separately. Modeling was conducted for the control models for the cooling water flow rate and the cooling tower fan air volume according to the control specifications described in Section 2.1. The equipment and control models were connected to complete the heat source system simulation. The accuracy of the heat source system simulation was verified using operation data acquired from April 1, 2023, to September 5, 2023, at 20-minute intervals. The results are shown in Fig. 5 . The prediction accuracy of the chiller power consumption was 0.96 of R2 and a CV (RMSE) of 13.5 %, and the prediction accuracy of the cooling tower power consumption was 0.88 of R2 and a CV (RMSE) of 15.1 %. These results satisfy all the error tolerance criteria (CV(RMSE) ≤ 30 %, R2 ≥ 0.75) for time-step calibrated simulations in the representative Measurement & Verification (M&V) guidelines ASHRAE Guideline 14, International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP), and Federal Energy Management Program(FEMP) [20,21,22]. The energy consumption of the heat source system was calculated while changing the control setpoints using the developed simulations. The cooling tower outlet cooling water temperature setpoint varied from 24 °C to 32 °C in 1 °C increments. the temperature difference of the cooling water at the inlet and outlet of the cooling tower setpoint also varied from 2 °C to 7 °C in 1 °C increments. Here, the operation data from April 1, 2023, to September 5, 2023, collected at 20-minute intervals, were used for the simulation input values of heat source load and outdoor air temperature and humidity. For all control setpoints, simulations were conducted to generate a total of 25,504 learning data points. 4 Development of a prediction model of power consumption in the DNN-based heat source system 4.1 Artificial neural network ANN, which are representative data-based prediction models, is a machine learning method that simulate the human nervous system and include DNN with multiple hidden layers, convolutional neural networks (CNN) for processing 2D images based on convolutional layers and pooling layers, and recurrent neural networks (RNN) for handling sequential data. In this study, a DNN-based prediction model was built with multiple hidden layers that exhibited good prediction performance in building energy prediction [23,24,25]. A DNN consists of an input layer, multiple hidden layers, and an output layer, as shown in Fig. 6 , where several neurons ( a ) are placed in each layer. In a hidden layer, each neuron uses an activation function ( f ) to determine its output, taking into account the weights ( ω ) and bias ( b ) of the neuron. Since an ANN is based on a feed-forward algorithm and derives its output through sequential computations at each layer, the model is trained by adjusting the weights of each neuron using a backpropagation algorithm to reduce the objective function [26]. For the activation function, the rectified linear unit (ReLu), which is commonly used in multilayer neural networks, was used. The ReLu function has a constant gradient (derivative) of 1 for positive input, as shown in Eqs. (7). This property allows it to overcome the vanishing gradient problem that occurs during the training of models with other activation functions, such as Tanh or Sigmoid. (7) f x = 0 x ≤ 0 x x > 0 The Adaptive moment estimation (Adam) optimizer was used to update the weights. Adam is a function that combines Adaptive Gradient (AdaGrad) and Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp). It is relatively simple but has excellent performance and efficiency. For the objective function, Mean Squared Error (MSE) was used, and for the model performance metric, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) was employed [6]. 4.2 Development of DNN model Fig. 7 shows the flow chart of the DNN-based prediction model development. The development process consists of four main steps: 1) dataset classification (building dataset), 2) hyperparameter optimization, 3) DNN model training, and 4) model evaluation. The first step is dataset classification. In this step, data required for learning data are obtained through the calibrated heat source system simulation model. The data are then normalized to adjust the size of the data. The learning data was then split into three categories: training, validation, and test sets, for hyperparameter optimization and prediction model training. The hyperparameters of the model were optimized to improve its prediction accuracy. Based on the optimization results, the model was trained to predict the power consumption of the heat source system. Finally, the model's performance based on the metrics such as R2 and CV(RMSE) using the test data was evaluated. Each step is described in detail below. 1) Dataset classification The training dataset was selected from simulated data that captured the physical factors impacting the power consumption of the heat source system. The input data is the outdoor air wet bulb temperature, number of operating chillers, heat source load, the cooling tower outlet cooling water temperature, the temperature difference of the cooling water at the inlet and outlet of the cooling tower, and the output data is the sum of power consumption of the chillers, cooling towers, and cooling water pumps that comprise the heat source system (hereinafter referred to as heat source system power consumption). Here, the heat source load was calculated using the temperature difference of the chilled water at the inlet and outlet of the chiller and the flow rate of the chilled water pump. The chiller power consumption was measured using a power meter. Due to the malfunction of the power meter, the cooling tower power consumption was estimated by multiplying operation unit number of cooling tower fans by the rated power consumption of each fan, while the cooling water pump power consumption was calculated using the relationship between operating frequency and power consumption (affinity law). Data normalization was conducted to prevent the model performance degradation due to scale differences between data. Min-max normalization, among various normalization methods, was employed in this study [24]. It is a method that reduces the size of data by assigning the maximum value of each data point to 1 and the minimum value to 0 so that the remaining values fall within that range. Normalized data is categorized into three sets: a training dataset for building the prediction model, a validation dataset for testing the model's performance, and a test dataset for verifying the model's final performance. In this study, each dataset was divided into 64 %, 16 %, and 20 % of the total data, respectively [27]. 2) Hyperparameter optimization Hyperparameters are parameters that are set by the model designer and have a significant impact on the model's prediction accuracy and learning efficiency. Therefore, they must be optimized [28]. There are several hyperparameter optimization methods, including manual search, grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization. Manual search is a method where the designer manually specifies values based on their experience or personal judgment, and the optimization process must be repeated several times to find the optimal combination using random values. Grid search is a hyperparameter optimization method that evaluates all possible combinations of hyperparameter values within a specified range and identifies the combination that yields the best performance. It exhibits excellent performance as it calculates all possible values, but it has the disadvantage of taking a long time to reach optimization. Random search is a hyperparameter optimization method that randomly samples a set of hyperparameters within a given range and evaluates the performance of the model for each set to find the best set of hyperparameters. While it is faster than grid search, random search has the disadvantage of potentially missing important parameters. Bayesian Optimization is a technique for finding the global optimum with the fewest attempts. It consists of two components: a surrogate model and an acquisition function. The surrogate model estimates the unknown objective function based on the range derived by the acquisition function (initially a random range). It can effectively model objective functions, and Gaussian Processes are commonly used as they can easily approximate the objective function. The acquisition function derives the following input value, or range of values, by minimizing the objective function based on the previously estimated results. The acquisition function is divided into exploitation, which explores the area around the point where the function value is maximized among the previous results, and exploration, which explores the area around the point where the standard deviation is maximized among the previous results. To derive accurate input values, one must navigate the trade-off between exploitation and exploration strategies. Recently, Expected Improvement (EI), which effectively utilizes both strategies, has been widely used and can be represented as shown in Eqs. (8) [29]. (8) E I λ = f ̇ - μ λ Φ f ̇ - μ λ σ + σ ϕ f ̇ - μ λ σ here, E refers to the expected improvement, I λ refers to the improvement, f ̇ refers to the maximum value up to now, μ λ refers to the average, Φ refers to the cumulative distribution function, σ refers to the variance, and ϕ refers to the probability density function. f ̇ - μ λ refers to the expected amount of improvement, Φ f ̇ - μ λ σ captures the probability of achieving this expected improvement, and ϕ f ̇ - μ λ σ accounts for the density (or magnitude) of the potential improvement. To minimize the objective function, EI calculates the expected value by adjusting the cumulative distribution function and the probability density function to represent the probability that a particular variable is less than or equal to a certain value. Based on this, the EI calculates the expected improvement within the exploration range and derives the next input value [30]. Thus, Bayesian Optimization iteratively recommends input values based on previous results, evaluates the objective function using these values, and updates the surrogate model. Therefore, it is more efficient in terms of training time and cost compared to previous methods [31]. There are various hyperparameters, such as the number of hidden layers, the number of nodes, dropout, learning rate, and batch size. The following four parameters were targeted for optimization: Number of hidden layers, Number of nodes, Dropout, and Learning rate. The hyperparameter range and the optimization results are presented in Table 3 . The optimization range of each hyperparameter is as follows: the Number of hidden layers is 2 to 10, the Number of nodes in each layer is 16 to 256, the Dropout rate is 0.0 to 0.5, and the Learning rate is 0.0001 to 0.01. Based on the Bayesian optimization results, the optimal combination of hyperparameters was determined as follows: the Number of hidden layers is 3, the Number of nodes in each hidden layer is 156, 173, and 87, respectively, the Dropout rate is 0.0, and the Learning rate is 0.0001. 3) DNN model training. The model was trained with optimized hyperparameters. The epoch was set to 200 times. The model was trained using the training data, and generalization validation was conducted to address issues, such as overfitting, before evaluating the model's performance. While methods such as cross-validation were also used, this study addresses the generalization problem by continuously updating the model with the lowest validation loss using data not used for training. 4) Model evaluation Fig. 8 shows the result of the prediction accuracy using the learning model. The result showed that the actual and predicted values almost matched, with a prediction accuracy of 0.99 of R2 and a CV (RMSE) of 1.205 %. This result satisfied all the criteria outlined in ASHRAE Guideline 14, IPMVP, and FEMP [19,20,21]. 5 Conclusions The objective of this study is to present a measure to address the problem of insufficient actual data and the resulting decrease in prediction accuracy in the development of data-based learning models for the optimal control of HVAC systems. To achieve the objective, a physics-based simulation model was developed for the equipment and control specifications of the heat source system, and calibration was performed using actual operation data to improve accuracy. Learning data was secured by changing the control setpoints (cooling tower outlet cooling water temperature and the temperature difference of the cooling water at the inlet and outlet of the cooling tower) through the developed simulation model. A DNN-based heat source system power consumption prediction model was developed using these data. The main study results are as follows: 1) The accuracy of the physics-based simulation model was 0.96 of R2 and a CV (RMSE) of 13.5 % when predicting the chiller power consumption and 0.88 of R2 and a CV (RMSE) of 15.1 % when predicting the cooling tower power consumption. These results satisfied all the accuracy standards of ASHRAE Guideline 14, IPMVP, and FEMP. 2) A total of 25,504 training data were generated by changing the cooling tower outlet cooling water temperature setpoint and the temperature difference of the cooling water at the inlet and outlet of the cooling tower setpoint using simulation. 3) A DNN model was developed that predicted the power consumption of the heat source system using the generated training data. Hyperparameters were optimized through Bayesian optimization to improve prediction accuracy. The optimization results were as follows: the number of hidden layers is 3, the number of nodes in each hidden layer is 156, 173, and 87, respectively, the dropout rate is 0.0, and the learning rate is 0.0001. 4) The DNN model was trained with the optimal hyperparameter combination. The model accuracy exhibited 0.99 of R2 and a CV (RMSE) of 1.21 %, which exceeds the ASHRAE Guideline 14 criteria. For future research, the optimal control algorithm will be developed using the prediction model in this paper and be applied to an actual building to verify the effectiveness of the optimal control algorithm. Furthermore, research will be conducted on the scalability of the developed prediction model as a source model to other systems through transfer learning.

        "dc:description": "Acquiring actual data for developing data-based prediction models for the optimization of control setpoints (hereinafter referred to as optimal control (OC)) in heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems is challenging, especially when changing control setpoints while considering all possible boundary conditions. Thus, considering the scalability of OC, it is a promising solution to generate sufficient learning data according to the control settings using a highly accurate simulation model, build a source model, and expand the learning model based on the actual data of the target system. This is the first study to improve the scalability of OC aiming to develop a deep neural network (DNN) model to predict the power consumption of a heat source system. First, this study will construct a calibrated heat source system simulation model and then use the generated learning data to train a DNN model. The actual operation conditions of the target building and heating system located in Vietnam were analyzed using operation data. A physics-based simulation model of the target heat source system was developed and calibrated using actual operation data to improve accuracy. By using the calibrated simulation, sufficient learning data was generated for all control settings allowing for the development of a learning model based on DNN that predicted the power consumption of the heat source system. In addition, a highly accurate prediction model through hyperparameter optimization was secured.",
