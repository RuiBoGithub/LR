Specifically, it has two key features including data-informed energy-saving potential identification and data-driven model-based energy savings evaluation. The paper demonstrates the proposed DiBEM with a detailed case study of an office and living laboratory building located in Cambridge, Massachusetts called HouseZero. It focuses on revealing the performance of the energy-efficient interventions from two-years\u2019 building performance monitoring data, as well as evaluating energy savings from the interventions based on the data-driven approach. With Year 1 as baseline, several interventions are proposed for Year 2 including improvements to controls and operation settings, encouragement of occupants\u2019 behavior for energy savings, and hardware retrofitting. These were deployed to heating/cooling, domestic hot water, lighting, plug and other loads, and photovoltaic (PV) systems. To quantify the impacts of different interventions on energy end uses, several data-driven models are developed. These models utilize linear regression, condition model, and machine learning techniques. Consequently, the heating/cooling energy consumption that was already ultra-low in Year 1 (12.8 kWh/m2) is further reduced to 9.7 kWh/m2 in Year 2, while the indoor thermal environment is well maintained. The domestic hot water energy is reduced from 2.3 kWh/m2 to 1.2 kWh/m2. The lighting energy is only increased from 0.3 kWh/m2 in pandemic operations without occupancy in Year 1 to 0.8 kWh/m2 in partial normal operations in Year 2, while the indoor illuminance level meets occupants\u2019 requirements. Combined with other relatively constant loads and the reduction of plug and other loads due to COVID building operation restrictions, the total energy use intensity is thereby reduced from 54.1 kWh/m2 to 42.8 kWh/m2, where 5.4 kWh/m2 of energy reduction for Year 2 is estimated to be contributed by the energy-efficient interventions. PV generation is 36.1 kWh/m2, with an increase of 1.4 kWh/m2 from a new inverter. In summary, this paper demonstrates the use of DiBEM through a detailed case study and long-term monitoring data as evidence to achieve ultra-low energy operations.

International Energy Agency proposed a target of reducing GHG from buildings by 75% by 2050 [1]. AIA 2030\u2032 Challenge provided a net-zero framework by setting a target goal from 50% of the national average and increasing 10% every-five years, leading to carbon\u2013neutral in 2030 without fossil fuel energy to operate [2]. It was reported that over half of the current global building stock will still be in use in 2050 [1]. Hence, improving the energy efficiency of existing buildings at the operation stage becomes essential to reach the ambitious emission reduction goals for the building sector. Various efforts have been made to improve the energy efficiency of building operations. Chidiac et al. evaluated the effectiveness of single or multiple energy retrofit measures (e.g., building envelope and air conditioning system upgrades) for office buildings [3]. Wu et al. optimized the retrofit of building envelope and energy systems for the residential community and found that the GHG emissions could be reduced by up to 76% [4]. Ascione et al. proposed a tailored approach for energy diagnosis based on in situ monitoring, documental information, and numerical studies [5]. It determined the suitable combination of energy efficiency measures, which reduced the GHG emissions by 38%. In addition to hardware retrofitting (e.g., the building or the energy systems), software improvements (i.e., controls) have also been widely employed to improve energy efficiency. Papadopoulos et al. developed a framework for fine-tuning HVAC cooling and heating setpoints of large office buildings in different climates using a simulation-based multi-objective optimization method [6]. The multi-objective optimization aims to guarantee tenant thermal comfort level and minimum energy consumption. They reported that optimized cooling and heating setpoint resulted in up to 60% of annual HVAC-related energy savings [6]. Han et al. utilized a model-based approach to optimize the operation of data center cooling systems, which saves 53.4\u201358.8 % of annual energy while still meeting the thermal requirements [7]. However, these studies were mostly conducted based on energy simulations, and very few reported the actual performance after implementing the measures. In addition, as pointed out by Ma et al. [8], the conventional building retrofit can be a lengthy and complex process, which may require numerical simulations for decision making and involve expensive consultancy from third parties. This may potentially lead to a barrier for broad acceptance of the process by the building operators. In addition to conventional energy-efficient measures, occupancy-based solutions have increasingly drawn attention. Nationwide energy-saving potential was evaluated for office buildings with occupant-based building controls by Pang et al. [9]. They concluded that occupancy-based controls could save up to 45.6% of energy in medium-sized offices. Wang et al. tested an occupancy-driven thermostat and the result showed that an occupancy information-based control algorithm can save about 11%-34% of energy without significantly compromising occupant comfort [10]. More research has also been done to reduce the lighting and plug loads through occupancy-based solutions. A Wi-Fi-based occupancy-driven lighting control system developed by Zou et al. controlled the lights and their brightness according to the occupancy and preference of the occupants [11]. The case study that was conducted for 24 weeks in an office building has shown that a new control system achieved 93.09% and 80.27% of energy savings compared to a static scheduling lighting control scheme and a passive infrared sensor-based lighting control scheme, respectively. Acker et al. evaluated the energy-saving potential of occupancy and load sensing plug strips by a field test in six office spaces [12]. A total of 121 plug strips were installed, and there was an average saving of 0.6 kWh/sf*yr. Most of these studies involved field experiments for higher credibility. However, the length of these experiments might be short-term and limited to a single-time intervention. Furthermore, most of these studies focused on only one or two types of strategies rather than a holistic solution that includes not only occupancy-based solutions, but also hardware retrofits and other control improvements. When applying energy-efficient interventions, tracking their energy savings after being deployed to the buildings is essential. Li et al. presented a comprehensive review of methods and tools for benchmarking a building's energy consumption against its past performance [13]. The methods were categorized into the back box, gray box, and white box [13]. Utilizing white-box models, such as mathematical models and simulation tools, usually provides a transparent calculation procedure and accurate results [14]. For example, Jaffal et al. created mathematical models of conventional roofs and green roofs to study the impact of green roofs on building energy performance [15]. However, considering the time and cost to develop a white-box model and the availability of input data collected from the extensive amount of sensors, Li et al. suggested utilizing black box models (data-driven models) to benchmark energy consumption before and after interventions [13]. For example, Heo and Zavala introduced a Gaussian process modeling framework to measure and verify building energy savings that captures complex nonlinear and multivariable interactions of energy behavior [16]. This paper presents a data-informed Building Energy Management (DiBEM) framework that supports comprehensive energy-efficient interventions from different building systems with different types of strategies. This includes retrofits of hardware, improvements of controls and operation settings, and reduction of energy through occupants' behavior. It identifies energy-saving potential through building performance monitoring, data analytics, and model-based modules. These data-driven models are developed for different energy end uses and are utilized to support data-informed energy-saving potential identification and track the energy savings from the interventions. They can be trained from data without expert knowledge and thereby allowing the process of model training to be potentially automated, which can allow continuous identification of energy-saving potentials during building operations. Though it still requires human input in determining and implementing energy-saving strategies, the proposed DiBEM aims to provide a lightweight, easy-to-implement, and semi-automatic solution to help buildings improve operational energy efficiency through the automatically generated regular energy report with model predictions as references. A case study that illustrates the framework with long term measured data is presented in detail, which demonstrates the use of the proposed framework in an ultra-low energy building and provides evidence of energy savings from proposed energy-efficient interventions based on actual data. The paper will first describe the overall framework, and then introduce its components as well as the results and analysis in detail for the studied case based on the workflow of the framework. 2 Methodology 2.1 Data-Informed building energy management (DiBEM) framework The DiBEM framework is proposed to improve energy efficiency systematically and continuously during the operation stage. As shown in Fig. 1 , the DATA and MODELS are the cores of the framework, which serve in different stages of the process for different purposes. The data is obtained from the building performance monitoring systems, such as outdoor sensors, indoor sensors, and sensors in different systems and is used for identification of energy savings potential and models development. The models (e.g., linear regression models or nonlinear machine learning (ML) models depending on the complexity of the data) are developed in different stages using different data. Fig. 2 illustrates how the data is processed, how the models are trained, as well as how the data and models are used at different stages (e.g., energy-saving potential identification stage and energy savings evaluation stage). The process starts with model development and data processing. First, an initial data-driven model is developed based on the raw data (in pre-intervention period) for each energy breakdown. The model is used to identify abnormal data or outliers, which supports generating a filtered dataset. Then, based on the filtered dataset, an updated model is trained and utilized to further process the data by filling in missing data. A complete dataset is therefore generated for the pre-intervention period. The next step is the energy-saving potential identification, which leverages both data and models to support decision makings. In the DiBEM framework, the evaluation and improvement of building performance is supported by the monitored data that is proceeded to ensure high-fidelity. These monitoring data include, among other things, local weather conditions, indoor environment, British thermal unit (BTU) meter data, energy breakdown sub-meter data, etc. This high-fidelity operational data is essential to allow the building operators to extract energy-saving potential. The monitoring data is compared with design intents, or energy targets from model predictions. For example, as shown in Fig. 2, the abnormal operation can be detected if the heating energy exceeds the energy target that is determined by a data-driven model trained from historical data. The additional energy-saving potential might be uncovered by contrasting the loads with the targets from other similar buildings, standards, or design guides. Then, the energy-saving potentials are identified, which may include, for example, system/equipment/sensor faults, inefficient devices/equipment, inefficient system controls, and improper operation settings. The energy-efficient interventions can therefore be determined to address the identified issues. This may include, for example, replacing an inefficient device, improving the control settings, or encouraging engagement of occupants\u2019 behavior for energy savings. Next, energy-efficient interventions will be implemented and deployed to different building systems, which include, for example, heating and cooling, domestic hot water (DHW), lighting, plug and other loads, and Photovoltaic (PV) systems. After the deployments, the impacts of the interventions are evaluated through the data-driven approach. The impacts of the intervention (energy savings) can be defined as the difference between the energy consumption for a period with interventions and the energy consumption for the same period without interventions. The energy consumption with intervention can be obtained directly from the monitoring data of the post-intervention period. The energy consumption for the post-intervention period without applying the energy-efficient intervention can be simulated by the predictive models, which are developed based on the data in the pre-intervention period without interventions. The energy savings can then be quantified by comparing the predicted and the actual energy consumption for the post-intervention period. The last part of this process will be performance reporting and results analysis. In addition to energy savings tracking and energy reports, other operational performance (for example, indoor thermal environment maintenance and detailed system operations) will also be summarized and analyzed to allow a comprehensive understanding of the building performance. The energy data as well as the models trained during the above process can then be used as the beginning of the next cycle for continuous monitoring, possible fault detection, and further energy-saving potential identification. 2.2 Case study This paper demonstrates the proposed DiBEM framework with a small office/laboratory building called HouseZero, located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The building's operational performance was comprehensively assessed through high-fidelity data collected over one year (June 2020 to May 2021, referred to as Year 1) and identified several issues in operation [17]. This paper further identifies energy-saving potential, proposes energy-efficient interventions, and assesses the actual performance of those interventions from long-term monitoring data in the following year (June 2021 to May 2022, referred to as Year 2), as well as the evaluation of energy savings from the interventions based on the proposed data-driven approach. The building functions as an office space and living laboratory. It integrates multiple low-energy technologies, such as a ground source heat pump (HP), thermally active building systems (TABS), and natural ventilation (NV) with automated windows, skylight, solar chimney, and photovoltaics (PV) leading to ultra-low annual energy consumption (54.1 kWh/m2 in Year 1). It also features an extensive sensor network with over 300 physical sensors and meters for operational and research purposes [17]. 2.2.1 Model development and data processing This section introduces the development of the data-driven models. Data-driven models are core elements of the proposed DiBEM framework. They facilitate raw data processing, including identifying outliers and imputing missing values. The models compute possible missing data to create a complete dataset. The models are also used to provide a reference for energy uses to detect abnormal operations and identify energy-saving potentials. In addition, these models can be utilized to evaluate the impacts of energy-efficient interventions on the building energy savings. As illustrated in Table 1 , different data-driven models are developed for different energy end uses to maximize simplicity and preserve accuracy. Outdoor weather-dependent variables such as heating loads and PV production can be trained with linear or polynomial regression models with input variables such as outdoor dry bulb temperature or solar radiation. The cooling energy, which uses geothermal wells for free cooling in this building, is modeled with a condition model as it can be explicitly expressed with if-statements based on its control logic, in which constant-speed pump will be turned on if the weighted weather forecast exceeds the user-defined threshold and otherwise turned off. For loads that are influenced by multivariate features or have complex pattern, machine learning models are adapted. For example, the decision tree models, as one of the most widely used models for supervised learning, are utilized for predicting DHW, plug loads, and lighting energy in this study. The other loads with relatively constant values throughout the year, such as IT, emergency lighting, or fire alarms, can be padded with the mean value. 2.2.2 Energy-saving potential identification This section describes how the models and high-fidelity data generated in Section 2.2.1 were utilized to identify energy-saving potential. Four cases are illustrated in Fig. 3 for different building systems: heating, PV, plug loads, and lighting, with different data-informed strategies. These include comparing energy data with a model predicted energy target or design intent for heating load and PV, or data mining from the pattern of the data for plug loads. As shown in Fig. 3 (a), by comparing the model predicted energy target with the actual heating energy data, an abnormal peak of heating energy use was identified after passive mode operation periods. This is because the natural ventilation during the passive mode overcooled the building structure (see the slab temperature in Fig. 3 (a)), which leads to additional heating demand to heat it back up when it switches from passive mode to heating mode. The passive mode is an operation mode when no mechanical heating or cooling is required. Therefore, the gap between actual heating energy and predicted heating energy could be the heating energy-saving potential if the building keeps its inertia and temperature in steady state during the passive mode. This can be achieved by modifying control settings for natural ventilation and will be described in Section 2.2.3. With collected PV production data during the pre-intervention period, the conversion efficiency of the old inverter was around 80\u201385%, which is much lower than the high-efficiency inverters that can achieve 96\u201398% as stated in the product description (design intent). The performance of the old inverter was also found to be unstable especially with low solar radiation. By assuming a daily average conversion efficiency of 93%, the shaded area shown in Fig. 3 (b), illustrates the PV production potential that could be improved by adopting an inverter with higher efficiency. Fig. 3 (c) shows the trend of the daily occupancy data and plug loads. With the varying occupancy data shown, the varying portion of the plug load is relatively small, and the constant portion (base plug load) is high. On one hand, the amount of plug loads consumed by standby loads are a relatively large portion of the total plug loads. On the other hand, this high base load also indicates that there might be energy-saving potential from reducing the stand-by energy consumption of the electrical appliances. Fig. 3 (d) illustrates the whole building lighting consumption of February 18, 2022 along with the occupancy presence pattern from a zone in the building. Comparing the building actual lighting load with the occupancy pattern reveals a 15-minute delay for the lighting of the corresponding zone to be turned off after occupants leave that zone. Thus, the shaded area shows an opportunity for an energy-saving strategy by reducing the 15-minute auto-off of the lighting controls. 2.2.3 Energy efficient interventions determination and deployment After identifying the energy-saving potential, various energy-efficient interventions for different building systems were proposed, and are summarized in Table 2 . These interventions were implemented and deployed to the building. In Year 1, the building was unoccupied due to the pandemic. In Year 2, the building was partially occupied and continued to be operated in pandemic mode for part of the year. From data analytics of the heating performance, it was found that the comfort ventilation and night ventilation overcooled the space and building structure when passive mode occurred during winter, which introduced additional heating demands. This happened when the system switched from passive mode to heating mode and lowered the overall heating efficiency. To address this issue, the night cooling target temperature was raised from 15 °C to 20 °C in April 2021, and a new ventilation program with pulse ventilation was applied in winter in February 2022. Pulse ventilation is a ventilation strategy that opens the window based on a prescribed schedule (e.g., every hour) and monitored CO2 concentration. In addition, the passive mode starting point was also optimized based on operational data to reduce the operation hours of the HP while meeting the heating requirement in the shoulder season (see Section 3.2.2). The DHW setting was adjusted from 150 °F (65.6 °C) to 130 °F (54.4 °C) in October of 2021 to allow an optimized operation, which balanced electric water heater operation with solar water heating production, while maintaining the temperature requirements for the hot water in the tank. Next, several energy-saving potentials were identified from the lighting operational data, which helped propose corresponding solutions to improve its energy efficiency. First, the lux sensor setpoint was adjusted to read actual brightness on the task surface and turn on the lights at the appropriate times on March 15, 2022. Second, the dimming level of the lights was adjusted according to the programs and tasks by zones on March 15, 2022. Lastly, to turn off the lights as soon as the zone is unoccupied, the auto-off duration was reduced from a default 15 min to 1 min. In addition, a few devices were found to consume energy during standby, which helped identify several measures to reduce the energy for the plug and other loads. First, all unnecessary equipment had been unplugged from the middle of October in Year 2, including a dishwasher, coffee maker, and microwave, due to the COVID-19 policy restricting eating and sharing at the lab or office. The building elevator was also turned off due to occupancy restrictions during COVID. Following this, the occupants were educated to participate in behavior energy savings as the building opened to occupants gradually (e.g., the computer/monitor power management practice) from January 16, 2022. Additionally, the audiovisual technology (AV) system inefficiencies were identified, and an additional device was added to optimize its operation on April 20, 2022. Lastly, during Year 1, the PV system efficiency fell short of meeting the design intents due to experimentations and possible inverter inefficiency. As a result, the inverter was replaced to secure higher and more consistent efficiency in early January 2022 and started to operate on January 11, 2022. In summary, a comprehensive set of energy-efficient interventions were identified from the operational data using analytics and models (what and how) applied to different systems, including retrofit of hardware, improvement of controls and operation settings, and encouragement of occupants\u2019 enegy saving behavior. 3 Results and analysis This section presents the actual performance of the interventions. First, the data-driven-model-based energy savings evaluation is performed to quantify the impacts of each intervention from long-term monitoring data. Then, the resulting energy use and PV harvest data are reported in conjunction with a benchmarking analysis. In addition, indoor thermal environment and system operations are also discussed to provide valuable insights into the overall building performance. For example, did the indoor environment meet occupants\u2019 thermal comfort requirements after deploying the energy-efficient interventions? How were the heating/cooling demands and coefficient of performance (COP) changed after the interventions? The weather conditions play an important role in the energy demands and PV production potential. The dedicated local weather station provides the annual hourly weather data for Year 1 and Year 2. Fig. 4 shows the differences between the two years\u2019 monthly data on temperature and solar radiation. The mean dry-bulb temperatures are similar for the two years, which would lead to similar heating and cooling demands. On the other hand, Year 2 shows more extreme conditions in both cooling and heating seasons. Year 2 has both the highest and the lowest outdoor temperatures throughout the year, which test the systems\u2019 capacity to meet demand to maintain target indoor temperatures. The average monthly total solar radiation in Year 2 is approximately 6 kWh/m2 lower than that of Year 1, which leads to a lower PV production potential in Year 2. 3.1 Energy savings evaluation 3.1.1 Heating and cooling There were two major interventions for heating, including intervention 1 on April 30, 2021, and intervention 2 on February 17, 2022. The detailed descriptions of the interventions can be found in Section 2.2.3. The data was split into pre-intervention and post-intervention periods for the two interventions, respectively. The data in the pre-intervention period was used to train the heating energy prediction model. T ¯ E (Averaged forecasted outdoor temperature) and the HP daily energy consumption data were used to train the model. The model was simplified by excluding the internal and solar heat gains as inputs because the heat loss through the building envelope is dominant in heating demand. Linear regression models were selected because of their small mean squared errors (MSEs) on both cases. The MSE of pre-intervention 1 was 0.08 (due to some outliers) and that of pre-intervention 2 was 0.02. Fig. 5 shows the performance of the developed models by comparing model prediction with the actual heating load. Next, the models were used to predict the heating energy during the post-intervention periods, assuming no interventions were made. As shown in Table 3 , intervention 1 saved approximately 3.14 kWh/m2 (28.7%) of heating energy. intervention 2 saved approximately 0.11 kWh/m2 (4.9%) of heating energy in the post-intervention period. The total energy saving for the heating corresponds to a 3.25 kWh/m2 reduction in the total energy use intensity (EUI) in Year 2 against that in Year 1. In addition to energy savings evaluation, a similar model-based approach to assess the energy loss due to a system fault for the cooling was also utilized. This provided quantitative estimates of the potential energy savings for the future if this system fault was resolved. The identified fault is that the setting of the cooling mode starting point was unintentionally changed from 20 °C to 15 °C in the summer of 2021. The issue was found and fixed on October 6, 2021. This resulted in increased operation hours of the cooling mode and cooling pump energy consumption in the summer of Year 2. It was estimated that if the cooling mode started with the designed setting, the cooling hours would be 594 h less, and the cooling energy would be 112 kWh less than actual. This corresponds to a 0.3 kWh/m2 increase in total EUI in Year 2. 3.1.2 Domestic hot water Based on the interventions mentioned in Section 2.2.3, the data sets were split into different periods (pre-intervention1 \u2013 August 2, 2021, pre-intervention2 \u2013 November 17, 2021) and data-driven models were trained for the pre-intervention period by using the outdoor temperature as inputs. The decision tree regression model was used yielding the least MSE on both training and testing sets. Fig. 6 shows the performance of the developed model by comparing the actual DHW load and the predicted loads. Adjustments to the electric hot water heater and solar hot water system setpoints were made on 8/2/2021. The impacts of the intervention on DHW are depicted in Table 4 . These energy savings correspond to a 1.4 kWh/m2 reduction to the total EUI in Year 2. 3.1.3 Lighting The major lighting intervention occurred on March 31, 2022 and that included optimizing the electric lighting initiation point to be when the lighting level intensity falls below 50 lux and auto-off timing from 15 min to one minute. Following the intervention date, the lighting load data were split into two periods (pre-intervention: June 1, 2021 to March 31, 2022, and post-intervention: April 1, 2022 to May 31, 2022). The first period was used to train the lighting prediction model. Occupancy rates from different occupancy sensors installed in 10 different zones along with solar radiation were used as inputs to this model. The decision tree model was selected to predict the lighting load among various machine learning (ML) models resulting in the least MSE errors on both the training (R2 = 0.875) and test sets (R2 = 0.429). Fig. 7 shows the performance of the developed model by comparing the actual lighting load and the predicted loads. The implemented lighting intervention's results led to a significant reduction of almost 60% in the lighting load, as depicted in Table 5 . This reduction is calculated based on the differences between the lighting load predicted by the developed ML model and the actual lighting load collected during the post-intervention period from the building. As a result, the energy saving corresponds to a 0.06 kWh/m2 reduction of the total EUI in Year 2. 3.1.4 Plug and other loads Based on the interventions mentioned in Section 2.2.3, the data sets were split into different periods (pre-intervention1 \u2013 October 15, 2021; pre-intervention2 \u2013 January 15, 2022; pre-intervention3 - April 20, 2022) and trained by using the occupancy rates from each zone as inputs. Four different zones' occupancy rates were referenced to calculate the impact of interventions for plug loads. The decision tree model was used among many different ML models yielding the least MSE errors on both training and testing sets. The coefficient of determinations (R2) of models are fitted with 0.78, 0.71, 0.78, respectively, for each intervention. Fig. 8 shows the performance of the developed model by comparing the actual plug load and the predicted loads. The results of interventions show the significant impact of major and minor changes in load reduction strategies. Table 6 lists the three plug load reduction strategies in office areas as well as common areas and their energy savings estimated based on models. The main interventions were to remove all unnecessary equipment from the outlets. This resulted in the largest impact on the reduction (20%) in plug loads for the post-intervention period. In addition, computer power management and occupants\u2019 engagement as part of a minor intervention reduced 7% of the total plug load. Another minor intervention led to additional reductions in total energy consumption. These energy savings correspond to a 2.2 kWh/m2 reduction to the total EUI in Year 2, in which 1.6 kWh/m2 is due to COVID building operation restrictions and 0.6 kWh/m2 is contributed by the proposed interventions. Other loads comprised 13% of the total electricity use in Year 1. Several pieces of equipment weres turned off due to COVID building operation restrictions, which were not off during the first year, including exhaust fan, elevator and elevator lighting, and room fan during the Year 2. This equates to a 3.6 kWh/m2 of reduction in total EUI in Year 2. 3.1.5 PVs The intervention of replacing the old inverter with a new one occurred in early January 2022. The data set was split into pre-intervention period (September 1 \u2013 December 31, 2021) and post-intervention period (January 11 \u2013 May 31, 2022). Fig. 9 (a) and (b) illustrate the model performance of predicting the overall PV production efficiency for the periods using old and new inverters, respectively. A polynomial regression model was adopted. The time-series data of PV production was not available before the meter was installed on late August 2021. This leads to a smaller range of solar radiation in Fig. 9 (a) (0.5\u20136.5 kWh/m2) than that in Fig. 9 (b) (0.5\u20138.25 kWh/m2), which results in slightly different patterns of the curves in the two plots in Fig. 9. As shown in Fig. 9, the new inverter leads to a better and more stable performance than the old inverter. Even when the solar radiation is lower than 1 kWh/m2, the average PV production efficiency of the new inverter is around 10%, while that of the old inverter is less than 5%. The old inverter leads to 10.8% of the overall average PV production efficiency, while with the new inverter, the overall average PV production efficiency increased to 14%. It was observed that the PV production efficiency slightly drops when the solar radiation increases to>6 kWh/m2. This might be explained by two aspects. First, the high solar radiation (6\u20138 kWh/m2) occurs in hot days (May-July). When the ambient air temperature increases to a certain level, the solar panel starts to lose efficiency due to the heat dissipation issue. Second, the overall PV production efficiency might slightly drop when the nominal power output is reached while the solar intensity keeps increasing. As described in Table 7 , the intervention of installing the new inverter contributes an additional 1.43 kWh/m2 (510 kWh) PV production in Year 2 as compared to the scenario with the old inverter. However, the actual PV production in Year 2 is notably lower than that in Year 1. A model-based assessment is performed to identify the reasons. The developed models were utilized to detect abnormal periods and quantify the impacts of the decreased solar radiation in Year 2. Data show a 1690 kWh of PV production loss (4.7 kWh/m2) in Year 2, in which 1145 kWh (68%) of this loss caused by the maintenance (e.g., meter installation, inverter installation) or inverter offline, and 545 kWh (32%) was solely due to the decreased solar radiation in Year 2 against that in Year 1. 3.2 Building energy and operational performance 3.2.1 Energy use and PV harvest This section compares energy consumption and production between Year 1 and Year 2. In reference Year 1 without any interventions, the total EUI is approximately 54.1 kWh/m2 (See Table 8 ), which is 26.6 kWh/m2 without IT and plug loads. As a lab that operates 24/7, the building has an extensive IT load, which consumes 17.8 kWh/m2 of the 54.1 kWh/m2 total energy (33%). As shown in Table 8, in Year 2 with interventions, the total EUI is reduced to 42.8 kWh/m2, which is 18.1 kWh/m2 without IT and plug loads. The IT load is relatively constant, consuming 17 kWh/m2 of the 42.8 kWh/m2 of total energy (40%). The annual heating and cooling energy consumption for Year 2 are 8.2 kWh/m2 and 1.5 kWh/m2, respectively. Those values are 0.2 kWh/m2 higher for cooling and 3.2 kWh/m2 lower for heating than that in Year 1. The proportion of cooling energy to the total increased from 2.4% in Year 1 to 3.5% in Year 2, and DHW decreased from 4.2% in Year 1 to 2% in Year 2. The reason for less DHW consumption is the lower setpoint for the water heater in Year 2. It is noteworthy that although less DHW was needed due to COVID policy restrictions in Year 2, this might increase with normal operation. Due to a lower threshold to switch from passive mode to cooling mode, the cooling period in Year 2 was extended by 25 days, yielding the increased cooling energy in Year 2. For heating, a total of 28% savings were estimated with 2 consecutive interventions in Year 2, and the actual heating consumption showed the equivalent number in reduction. Plugs load excluding IT was about 20% lower in Year 2 against that of Year 1, mainly because of the energy-efficiency efforts and COVID-19 pandemic building operation policy, such as no dining or shared activities in indoor space. Control loads are relatively constant in the two years. The IT load was dominant in both years. Lastly, the efforts of lighting interventions were very beneficial. They resulted in an increase of only 0.5 kWh/m2 in Year 2 since the building was in pandemic mode without occupancy in Year 1 and partially operated in Year 2. Finally, energy efficiency interventions were estimated to contribute 5.4 kwh/m2 of energy reduction for Year 2. Fig. 10 shows the monthly breakdown of energy end uses in Year 2. Cooling energy was relatively constant throughout the cooling season. This is because the cooling is provided by a constant-speed circulation pump (circulating water from geo-well to the building), and it is operated for similar hours in these months. The heating dominates from November. The lowest heating and cooling energy consumption occurred in October and May by taking advantage of natural ventilation. Plug loads decreased significantly after November due to the intervention that reduced unnecessary devices, and lighting loads fluctuated depending on the occupancy rate. Other loads, including IT and control systems, are generally constant. The measured PV production in Year 2 is 36.1 kWh/m2 for the total area of the building. This is 6.7% lower than the first year's production although the new inverter installed in January 2022 contributes an additional 1.4 kWh/m2. This is due to approximately 4% lower annual solar radiation, the system being partially functioning in different periods for a total of 28 days for experimentation, and installation of a new inverter and meters. To better understand the level of energy efficiency of the building, a comprehensive benchmarking analysis was conducted by comparing its Year 1 and Year 2 energy use with different references, including databases, standards, design guides, and energy targets from different institutes as shown in Fig. 11 . Energy Star presented the national median EUI for offices in the U.S. based on the Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) [18]. The median EUI of zero energy buildings (ZEBs) that are extremely energy efficient was provided by NBI [19]. Compared to those data, the building\u2019s Year 2 EUI is 74.4% lower than the Energy Star data and 41% lower than the NBI data. HouseZero is also compared to a reference small office building located in the 5A climate aligned to the standard ASHRAE 90.1\u20132019 [20]. It is found that HouseZero consumes 48.3% lower EUI than the reference building. Various target EUIs were proposed by different institutes. Advanced Energy Design Guides led by ASHRAE proposed a target EUI of 73.2 kWh/m2/year for small to medium offices at 5A climate zone [21]. Net Zero Annex (U.K.) [22] and nbi [23] also provided two more aggressive targets (i.e., 55 kWh/m2/year and 56.8 kWh/m2/year, respectively). HouseZero EUI is 22.2\u201324.6% lower than the two aggressive Net Zero Annex (U.K.) and NBI targets, which demonstrates a high level of energy efficiency. In addition to the site EUI, a target of reduction of fossil fuel energy use was proposed by the AIA 2030\u2032s challenge, which provided a target goal from 50% of the national average to zero fossil fuel energy use by 2030 [2]. The goals in 2025 is set to be 90% of reductions from the baseline, which are 31.9 kWh/m2/year with the CBECS average data as baseline and 16.7 kWh/m2/year with the Energy Star office buildings as baseline. Since renewable resources provide about 30% of Massachusetts' total in-state power generation [24], the fossil fuel portion of HouseZero's EUI is estimated to be 4.7 kWh/m2/year, which is 85.3% and 71.9% lower than the two 2025 targets. 3.2.2 Indoor thermal environment Fig. 12 compares the hourly floor-averaged indoor air temperatures during the working hours under different operation modes in the two years. The occasional low temperatures occurring in the first year were mainly due to the settings of the night cooling target temperature [17]. It was changed from 15 °C to 20 °C at the end of Year 1; most of the low temperatures were therefore eliminated in Year 2, as shown in the right plot in Fig. 12 . Although a few high temperatures occur on the third floor, the indoor air temperatures are generally well controlled within an acceptable comfort range (e.g., roughly 20\u201325 °C, ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55) in Year 2. 3.2.3 System operations The theoretical operating percentages of heating, cooling, and passive modes in the first year calculated based on weather conditions were reported to be 40.5%, 32.8% and 26.7%, respectively [17]. These numbers are similar to that of Year 2, which indicates the weather conditions for the two years are similar (regarding calculated theoretical percentages rather than the actual percentages shown in Fig. 13). However, as shown in Fig. 13, the actual operating percentages of heating and cooling modes in Year 1 are noticeably lower than the theoretical ones. This is partly due to the fact that in Year 1, the operation mode was switched to a default passive mode due to connectivity issues and others operation settings. In addition, more cooling hours in the second year were due to the fact that the threshold to switch between cooling and passive modes was changed from 20 °C to 15 °C. For system operations, both load and source sides are analyzed. On the load side, the slab temperature control performances in the two years are compared in Fig. 14 . The slab temperatures are controlled similarly in the two years, which are generally within 2 °C around the setpoints. It is slightly better in Year 2 regarding the extremely low slab temperatures. This is due to the revised setting of the night cooling target temperature in Year 2. On the source side, the performance of the geothermal well in the two years is compared in Table 9 . The heat extracted from the geothermal well in the heating season is generally balanced with the heat entering the well in the cooling season in Year 1. However, more heat is injected to the well in Year 2 because of less heating demand and increased cooling demand. The average water temperature going from the geothermal well to the HP is similar in the cooling season in the two years. It is higher in Year 2 for the heating season. These temperatures are affected by the weather conditions and heating/cooling demands. Fig. 15 compares the monthly heating and cooling demands over the two years. The cooling demand is higher in Year 2 than that in Year 1. This is mainly because of the lower threshold to switch from passive mode to cooling mode in Year 2, which leads to more cooling hours occurring especially in the shoulder season, e.g., June and September. On the other hand, the heating demand in the second year is lower than that in Year 1. In addition to the weather effect, the interventions made help reduce the heating demand from natural ventilation in winter as explained in Sections 2.2.2 and 2.2.3. Table 10 shows the heating and cooling COPs over the two years, where Year 2 performs better. Year 1\u2032s overall heating COP is lower than that in Year 2. The following reasons can explain this. First, spot electric heating was used in the first year, which was experimented as a supplement during COVID. This was eliminated in Year 2. Second, the geothermal well water temperature is higher in the second year than that in Year 1. The cooling COP declines slightly in the second year though it is still extremely energy efficient. Again, this is due to the lower threshold to switch from passive mode to cooling mode in Year 2. Consequently, more cooling hours occurred when the cooling demand was low during the shoulder season, but the cooling energy remains relatively constant due to the constant-speed circulation pump. 4 Discussions The building design and its systems play an important role in achieving its ultra-low total EUI. Free cooling in the building depends only on the efficiency of the electric pump to pull and circulate the cool water directly from the geothermal well. It requires only energy to circulate water throughout the geothermal well and TABS. The lower the number of running hour of the pump the more efficient cooling becomes. To do so, optimized night cooling and cooling control based on the outdoor temperature and weather forecasts reduce the need for cooling energy is the key element. In a naturally ventilated building such as HouseZero, the control of ventilation through automated windows becomes important [25]. A higher sensitivity in the natural ventilation operation strategy is required to ensure higher efficiency and indoor air quality in heating mode. Natural ventilation in hot or cold days may bring additional heating or cooling demand to the room. In such instances, buffering via a demand-based CO2 level control balanced with a temperature-based control can help reduce heating and cooling loss. The data informed models for building management described in this paper are crucial to maintaining optimal operation of the heating and cooling of ultra-efficient buildings. Prediction of the lighting and plug loads requires an understanding of occupancy patterns during operational hours, which affects prediction accuracy. Two strategies to model occupancy data for lighting and plug loads were proposed. For lighting, daily occupancy presence time\u2014along with solar radiation\u2014was used, and for plug loads, the weighted average of occupancy data per zone, in conjunction with the appliances' run and standby loads, were used for higher accuracy. Greater prediction accuracy is possible by increasing the resolution level of the input data, such as considering time of day when defining occupancy rates and solar radiations or having hourly input data in the analysis. Some occupancy sensors produced faulty data and hence were removed from the analysis. Thus, the prediction model can be further improved if the occupancy data from all zones is available. Occupants in the building primarily performed tasks with computers/laptops that requires a lower lux level, and a task light is available for other paper-based work. As an experimental building with an ambitious naturally climatized goal, the threshold to switch from daylight to electric lighting in HouseZero was set to a relatively low level (50 lx), which was determined based on visual perception in the building. To ensure the adequacy of the lighting, a survey was conducted in Year 2. 88.9% of the total respondents were satisfied with the overall lighting condition at their workstations, and all respondents performed computer-based work during work hours. All respondents replied that they were satisfied with the electric lighting, daylighting, and light on the computer screen, but 22.2% of respondents said they were unsatisfied with the lighting conditions for paper-based work. Use of the task light installed at each workstation when light levels are lower than satisfactory is encouraged. Due to flexible working hours and policy restrictions of COVID-19 during part of Year 2, the operational schedule and assumptions of this study were included. The building\u2019s operation mode in Year 2 followed the hybrid COVID-19 policy within campus. Therefore, the occupants in the building were able to unplug some of the pantry appliances due to food sharing restrictions and indoor policy requirements. However, it can be expected that in normal operation, energy consumption in terms of some loads, such as plugs and DHW, might be increased. The strict requirements to maintain the original expression and proportions of the building led to constraints on the use of PV panels such that currently only the roof surfaces that are east west are utilized. Based on the five months' data of PV production after replacing the inverter, the average daily efficiency of the new inverter is about 92%, with a peak efficiency of 96%, which varies with the climate due to input and output power variations. However, it was found that this efficiency is still lower than the expectation, as exhibited in the product specifications. This may be because the solar radiation, input, and output power have significant impacts on the overall performance of the inverter, and these conditions during operations are discrepant with that in design. This suggests that the amount of uncertainty of the expected PV production efficiency should be carefully considered in the design stage. Expanding the boundary other than the roof, if possible, will allow flexibility to generate more eneryg from PV to meet all building loads. 5 Conclusion Energy-efficient building operation requires the integration of many different loads and managing each category with relevant strategies. This paper proposed a data-informed building energy management (DiBEM) framework to optimize the energy efficiency of building operations. Specifically, the proposed framework delineates the process of model development and data processing, data-informed energy-saving potential identification, energy-efficient intervention determination and deployment, data-driven-model-based energy savings evaluation, as well as reporting and analysis. The proposed DiBEM framework was implemented in an office/living laboratory located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The case study follows the workflow of the framework, and the analysis and results were based on two-year\u2019s building performance monitoring data. Through a data-informed approach, several interventions were proposed including improvements to controls and operation settings, encouragement of occupants\u2019 behavior for energy savings, and hardware retrofitting based on Year 1\u2032s data, and deployed to the heating/cooling, DHW, lighting, plug and other loads and PV systems in Year 2. The result showed that the total EUI was reduced from 54.1 kWh/m2 to 42.8 kWh/m2, where 5.4 kWh/m2 was estimated to be contributed by the interventions. This case study demonstrated the effectiveness of this data driven framework to improve the energy efficiency of building operations. Relying on human inputs for operational issues identifications may delay the process, leading to possible reduction in energy savings. Semi-automating the DiBEM framework can reduce this reliance and yield rapid identifications of energy-saving potential to support enhanced building operation. Data driven building management can also lead to further improvement of building energy efficiency by adopting optimal control algorithms [26], such as, model predictive control.

        "dc:description": "To support building operations in reaching ultra-low energy targets, this paper proposes a data-informed building energy management (DiBEM) framework to improve energy efficiency systematically and continuously at the operation stage. Specifically, it has two key features including data-informed energy-saving potential identification and data-driven model-based energy savings evaluation. The paper demonstrates the proposed DiBEM with a detailed case study of an office and living laboratory building located in Cambridge, Massachusetts called HouseZero. It focuses on revealing the performance of the energy-efficient interventions from two-years\u2019 building performance monitoring data, as well as evaluating energy savings from the interventions based on the data-driven approach. With Year 1 as baseline, several interventions are proposed for Year 2 including improvements to controls and operation settings, encouragement of occupants\u2019 behavior for energy savings, and hardware retrofitting. These were deployed to heating/cooling, domestic hot water, lighting, plug and other loads, and photovoltaic (PV) systems. To quantify the impacts of different interventions on energy end uses, several data-driven models are developed. These models utilize linear regression, condition model, and machine learning techniques. Consequently, the heating/cooling energy consumption that was already ultra-low in Year 1 (12.8 kWh/m2) is further reduced to 9.7 kWh/m2 in Year 2, while the indoor thermal environment is well maintained. The domestic hot water energy is reduced from 2.3 kWh/m2 to 1.2 kWh/m2. The lighting energy is only increased from 0.3 kWh/m2 in pandemic operations without occupancy in Year 1 to 0.8 kWh/m2 in partial normal operations in Year 2, while the indoor illuminance level meets occupants\u2019 requirements. Combined with other relatively constant loads and the reduction of plug and other loads due to COVID building operation restrictions, the total energy use intensity is thereby reduced from 54.1 kWh/m2 to 42.8 kWh/m2, where 5.4 kWh/m2 of energy reduction for Year 2 is estimated to be contributed by the energy-efficient interventions. PV generation is 36.1 kWh/m2, with an increase of 1.4 kWh/m2 from a new inverter. In summary, this paper demonstrates the use of DiBEM through a detailed case study and long-term monitoring data as evidence to achieve ultra-low energy operations.",
