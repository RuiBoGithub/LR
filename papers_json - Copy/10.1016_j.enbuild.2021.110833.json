Graphical abstract Training and testing diagram: blue lines indicate the training phase to get optimal weights for Q-network; red lines indicate the testing phase using trained Q-network; green lines indicate the common steps shared by both training and testing. Energy efficiency remains a significant topic in the control of building heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, and diverse set of control strategies have been developed to optimize performance, including recently emerging techniques of deep reinforcement learning (DRL). While most existing works have focused on minimizing energy consumption, the generalization to energy cost minimization under time-varying electricity price profiles and demand charges has rarely been studied. Under these utility structures, significant cost savings can be achieved by pre-cooling buildings in the early morning when electricity is cheaper, thereby reducing expensive afternoon consumption and lowering peak demand. However, correctly identifying these savings requires planning horizons of one day or more. To tackle this problem, we develop Deep Q-Network (DQN) with an action processor, defining the environment as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) with a reward function consisting of energy cost (time-of-use and peak demand charges) and a discomfort penalty, which is an extension of most reward functions used in existing DRL works in this area. Moreover, we develop a reward shaping technique to overcome the issue of reward sparsity caused by the demand charge. Through a single-zone building simulation platform, we demonstrate that the customized DQN outperforms the baseline rule-based policy, saving close to 6% of total cost with demand charges, while close to 8% without demand charges. Keywords Deep reinforcement learning Partially observable Markov decision processes DQN Energy cost Demand charge Energy efficiency 1 Introduction It has been well acknowledged that commercial buildings account for over 20% of the total energy consumption in the U.S. [1]. Particularly, about 40\u201350% of such consumption is mainly attributed to the heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems [2]. Thus, energy efficiency remains a significantly critical topic and effective control and maintenance strategies for operating HVAC systems are indispensable to improve that. Traditionally, simple rule-based and feedback controls such as on\u2013off control or PID control have been used to control the indoor environment based on different time and occupancy schedules [3]. However, these two categories of controllers result in sub-optimal performance due to lack of predictive information on external disturbances such as weather [4] and occupancy [5]. Model predictive control (MPC) as an optimal control strategy has been leveraged to tackle such issues by iteratively conducting online optimization over a receding time horizon. Though many successes have been demonstrated using MPC [6\u20138], its performance relies highly on the accuracy of the model [9,10] as well as the robustness of the online optimization [11,12]. The key challenge is balancing the trade-off between model accuracy and computational tractability. Another emerging technique that has received considerable attention is deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which is a learning-based optimal control method that learns by the direct interaction of the control agent with the environment. It has been used to solve the high-dimension sequential decision-making or continuous control problems such as in games [13], robotics [14] and autonomous driving [15], which were difficult for tabular RL. While by leveraging DRL, many works have shown the applicability to building HVAC optimal control [16\u201320], the sample complexity (the number of training samples required) still remains a significant issue to be addressed. Most recent works leveraging DRL approaches and focusing on building HVAC controls have studied extensively energy consumption and thermal comfort requirements [7,16]. However, due to the time-varying electricity price profiles (with different on-peak/off-peak prices), energy cost rather than consumption is more interesting to commercial buildings. Moreover, the cost caused by the peak electric demand, i.e., the so-called demand charge, further increases the difficulty of the optimal controller design in building HVAC systems. These pricing structures can be leveraged via passive thermal energy storage [21], which temporally shifts energy consumption by exploiting the thermal inertia of the solid building components. This technique can lead to significant cost reduction without sacrificing thermal comfort, but proper application requires accurate planning over horizons of 12\u201336 h. Though such a problem has been extensively investigated by using MPC-based methods [22\u201324], our work will instead attempt to address the problem with the recently developed DRL approaches. Contributions. In this work, by taking into consideration practical scenarios where most key states are not fully observable, the environment is defined as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) instead of an MDP as done in previous works [17,25]. Specifically, the following contributions are made. \u2022 We develop a model-free DRL approach, a Deep Q-Network (DQN) with an action processor that outputs near-optimal control actions given only a limited amount of historical data and user-defined comfort limits, to minimize the time-of-use cost and demand charge, while maintaining the comfort requirements. \u2022 We also develop a reward shaping technique to overcome the issue of the reward sparsity caused by the demand charge. \u2022 We propose a model selection technique to choose the best neural network weights for use once the training phase is complete. We employ three different model selection methods with the proposed DQN framework in order to show a thorough comparison. \u2022 We empirically validate the proposed approach using a single-zone building simulation platform with a local PI controller regulating the zone temperature. Two scenarios, one with demand charges and one without, are investigated accordingly. In both scenarios, the temperature regulation will display the fact that pre-cooling is performed in the early morning when electricity is cheaper, thereby reducing expensive day-time consumption and lowering peak demand. \u2022 We perform a practical evaluation of the strategies by including the cost of random exploration in performance metrics. Most other works examining RL assume that a very large amount of past historical data is freely available for training. However, in real buildings, electricity bills cannot be put on hold while exploratory data is collected, and thus these costs cannot be neglected. Outline. The rest of the paper is outlined as follows. Section 2 presents related works on the applications of MPC and DRL to the building HVAC control as well as introduces time-varying cost and demand charge. While Section 3 provides an overview of POMDP and DQN, in Section 4 we describe the system in detail, consisting of the dynamics, cost function, and the rule-based policies. The proposed approaches and techniques are presented in Section 5. The simulation experiments including results and discussion are given in Section 6. Finally, concluding remarks and possible directions for future research are summarized in Section 7. 2 Related work and novelty In this section, we review the recent related works by using MPC and DRL approaches. In addition to that, we also discuss the novelty and significance of our work. 2.1 MPC and DRL for HVAC As discussed before, the accuracy of the dynamic model significantly affects the control performance [26]. A popular linear MPC approach is based on the RC-Network [3,27,28], by simplifying the thermal dynamics of the building HVAC system as an electrical network. A prominent drawback while using RC-Network models is that they require (unmeasurable) internal heat loads as inputs, which must be modeled separately. Hence, data-driven controls such as adopting auto-regressive models [29], neural networks [7,30], random forest [31], and deep neural networks [8] have been shown to be effective for the purpose of modeling, without having to consider the specific physics within buildings. Although data-driven models excel at modeling the system dynamics, they may cause poor sub-optimal performance due to the numerical challenges of the associated online optimization problem. To overcome the issues aforementioned in MPC, deep reinforcement learning has been recently studied as an alternative for building HVAC optimal controls [16]. Simulation results have unfortunately demonstrated the sample inefficiency issue with deep reinforcement learning. To remedy the sample inefficiency problem, various schemes have been recently proposed, including learning the model of the environment [20] and making use of historical data for pre-training [25]. The authors in [32] showed that model-based approaches helped avoid sample inefficiency by benefiting from a learned model of the environment. This is also supported in [19], where they used a neural network policy to imitate MPC. Jia et al. [18] used historical state-action pairs to pre-train the agent and in [33] the experience replay buffer was populated by the historical data. Despite some publications [34\u201336] regarding improving energy efficiency and maintaining comfort requirements in building HVAC systems, the aforementioned works using DRL techniques have not considered energy consumption with electricity time-of-use tariffs. 2.2 Energy cost in HVAC In our study, we are interested in minimizing the energy cost instead of the energy consumption and maintaining comfort requirements. Additionally, to avoid the high cost caused by the peak electric demand, we also take into account minimizing the demand charge. This problem has been recognized difficult, yet practically useful, since for most commercial buildings, utility companies typically charge based on daily or monthly peak demands [23]. Risbeck and Rowlings investigated this problem in a theoretical perspective in their recent work [22] using the economic MPC to optimize the total energy cost. The authors in [37] have studied this in buildings with thermal storage by formulating it as a stochastic optimal control problem and solving approximately using MPC. Due to the incorporation of time-varying electric price profiles and demand charge in the objective function, MPC-based approaches require an accurate model and a large prediction horizon which can lead to complex online optimization if the dynamic model is highly nonconvex and nonlinear, or even intractable. Hence, leveraging DRL helps us avoid complex model establishment and allows for the optimal controller to directly learn from real-time data. 2.3 Novelty The novelty of this work lies in three folds. First, the proposed approach has more potential applicability in terms of practical use and scalability. In our study, a customized DRL framework is developed, which is independent of the physics-based knowledge thermal dynamic model that could be unique in each building. The absence of the requirement to establish an accurate model vastly increases the deploy-ability of our proposed scheme in different buildings. Second, given that most recent works that have adopted DRL (as opposed to shallow Q network RL) methods have not investigated the demand charge problem with time-varying pricing profiles, our work formulates the problem as a POMDP and focuses both on reducing time-of-use energy cost and demand charge. We study in detail how a customized model-free DRL algorithm can be applied to building HVAC controls for saving cost while maintaining comfort requirements. Third, different from most previous works in which simulators were used to generate sufficient amount of data for training, in our work, the simulator plays a key role as a real testbed that can only provide a limited amount of historical data. The significance of this is that even with a limited amount of data, the proposed DRL method performs well. This addresses the sample inefficiency problem present in other recently proposed model-free DRL approaches. 3 Preliminaries We provide the background information in this section before the proposed method is introduced in the following sections. We first present the POMDP and then revisit the Deep Q-Network (DQN). 3.1 POMDP Model-free RL approaches obtain their optimal control policies generally through the interaction with the environment, where the full states of the system can be provided or even determined. Truly speaking, the Markov property rarely holds in real world environments (even the simulator used in Section 6). Therefore, such a process can be represented by a POMDP, which better captures the dynamics of the building HVAC system through only the observations of the agent that are viewed as the partial information of the underlying system states. For example, in a thermal zone, the current zone temperature is not only dependent of the last time step of zone temperature, but also last several ones, which is due to variations of the internal heat load that cannot be observed. Specifically, it can be summarized as a 7-tuple 〈 S , A , T , R , Ω , O , γ 〉 [38]: \u2022 S is a finite set of states \u2022 A is a finite set of actions \u2022 T is state transition probability matrix such that T ss \u2032 a = P [ S t + 1 = s \u2032 | S t = s , A t = a ] \u2022 R is a reward function, R s a = E [ R t + 1 | S t = s , A t = a ] \u2022 Ω is a finite set of observations \u2022 O is an observation model such that O as \u2032 o = P [ O t + 1 = o | S t + 1 = s \u2032 , A t = a ] \u2022 γ is a discount factor such that γ ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] . We briefly overview how it works within a POMDP. At an arbitrary time step t, the agent selects an action A t = a given the current state S t = s . When the action a is executed in the environment, the current state is transmitted to the next state S t + 1 = s \u2032 according to the state transition dynamics shown above such that the agent observes O t + 1 = o . Finally, a reward R t + 1 = r is received by the agent by using the reward function. Typically, T and R are both unknown to the agent and in this work, we only specify the reward function based on the domain knowledge. DRL aims at searching for an optimal policy that maximizes the cumulative discounted reward, i.e., return, expressed as G t = ∑ k = 0 ∞ γ k R t + k + 1 . Various DRL methods have been proposed and developed, including value-based methods, policy-based methods, and actor-critic methods, and they have also been applied to building HVAC controls. For a detailed introduction of DRL approaches, please refer to [39] for an excellent review. For application to building HVAC control, an exhaustive survey has been released to summarize most recent works [40]. In this paper, we develop a variant of DQN, which is an off-policy method that is more sample-efficient than most on-policy methods. We first provide a brief overview of DQN. 3.2 DQN Deep Q learning, as a benchmark DRL algorithm, has been adopted in different areas [39]. The parameterized value function by a deep neural network is called deep Q-network, which outputs the action corresponding to the maximum of Q value by updating the value function of state-action pairs. We first introduce two key definitions, i.e., state value function and state action value function. The state value function is the expected return starting from an arbitrary state s : V π ( s ) = E [ G t = | S t = s ] . Similarly, the state action value function is defined as Q π ( s , a ) = E [ G t | S t = s , A t = a ] . To derive the DQN, the optimal Q value denoted by Q ∗ ( s , a ) is defined as Q ∗ ( s , a ) = max π E [ G t | S t = s , A t = a ] . It has been well known that state action value function follows the Bellman equation [41] such that if the optimal value Q ∗ ( s \u2032 , a \u2032 ) at the next time step was known for all possible actions a \u2032 , then the optimal control policy selects the action a \u2032 that can maximize the expected value of r + γ Q ∗ ( s , a ) . Hence, one can get the following expression for the optimal state action value (1) Q ∗ ( s , a ) = E s \u2032 ~ E [ r + γ max a \u2032 Q ∗ ( s \u2032 , a \u2032 ) | s , a ] , which provides us with an effective estimate of the state action value function. E represents the environment. Additionally, the iterative update of Q value can be obtained by (2) Q t + 1 ( s , a ) = E s \u2032 ~ E [ r + γ max a \u2032 Q t ( s \u2032 , a \u2032 ) | s , a ] . Generally, we use some function estimators, either linear or nonlinear, to estimate the state action value function, i.e., Q ( s , a ; θ ) ≈ Q ∗ ( s , a ) , where θ represents the estimated parameters. In this context, we adopt a nonlinear function estimator, deep neural network with weights θ as a Q-network. To stabilize the training, we employ a target network as used in [42] such that the Q-network can be trained by minimizing a sequence of loss functions (3) L t ( θ t ) = E s , a ~ ℘ ( · , · ) [ ( y t - Q ( s , a ; θ ) ) 2 ] y t = E s \u2032 ~ E [ r + γ max a \u2032 Q ( s \u2032 , a \u2032 ; θ t - ) | s , a ] , where ℘ ( s , a ) is a probability distribution over state s and action a. Such a target network can be copied periodically from the Q-network. θ t - is fixed when optimizing the loss function L t ( θ t ) . To obtain the gradient of L t ( θ t ) at θ t , we differentiate the loss function and obtain the following (4) ∇ L t ( θ t ) = E s , a ~ ℘ ( · , · ) , s \u2032 ~ E [ ( r + γ max a \u2032 Q ( s \u2032 , a \u2032 ; θ t - ) - Q ( s , a ; θ t ) ) ∇ θ t Q ( s , a ; θ t ) ] . In practice, we calculate the stochastic gradient when optimizing the loss function instead of the full expectation. Deep Q learning algorithms are unfortunately not able to decipher the underlying states of the POMDP as in general estimating a Q value can be arbitrarily bad via an observation due to Q ( s , a ; θ ) ≠ Q ( o , a ; θ ) . Therefore, in this context, the underlying system states are estimated via sequences of observations such that the gap between Q ( s , a ; θ ) and Q ( o , a ; θ ) can be narrowed. 4 System description Before discussing our proposed approach, we describe our system of interest, including relevant dynamics, cost structure, action/observation spaces, and rule-based policies. 4.1 System dynamics Our system consists of a thermal zone of an office building served by a local cooling source that is controlled by a PI controller and a local thermostat. The zone receives heat directly from solar radiation, plug loads, and internal occupants, while exchanging heat with the ambient due to the indoor/outdoor temperature difference. In order to maintain constant zone temperature, the amount of cooling must be adjusted by the controller to counteract these heat loads. If the measured zone temperature is above its current setpoint, the controller increases the magnitude of cooling until the setpoint is reached; by contrast, if the zone temperature is below the setpoint, the controller cannot take any direct action and must wait for the zone to heat up from the disturbances. The most important dynamic feature for our current study is the fact that the air inside the zone changes temperature much faster than do the zone\u2019s solid-mass components (i.e., floor, ceiling, walls, and furniture). This timescale difference can serve as passive energy storage: if the temperature the solid mass is lower than the temperature of the air, the solid mass serves as a heat sink for the air as the two slowly equilibrate in temperature. Thus, an agent can choose an artificially low setpoint in the morning to lower the mass temperature, which will then reduce cooling requirements later in the day. Since the lower mass temperature increases the rate of heat gain from the ambient, such strategies are almost never beneficial when minimizing energy use, but with the generalization to minimizing energy cost, significant savings are possible. System measurements are available every δ = 1 min . However, to reduce complexity, agents communicate with the system only every Δ = 15 min . Thus, when agents communicate with the system, observations give the average of the last Δ / δ = 15 measurements taken by the system, while actions are held constant over the next 15 timesteps. 4.2 Cost function The overall goal of each agent is to maintain thermal comfort in the zone at the lowest energy cost. Note that throughout this discussion, t represents the faster system timestep, i.e., every δ = 1 min . In this context, thermal comfort is defined as maintaining zone temperature between time-varying temperature bounds T t min and T t max , which are set to 22 ° C and 24 ° C weekdays 7 am to 5 pm, with 20 ° C and 26 ° C at all other times. This also corresponds to the indoor occupancy pattern that 7 am to 5 pm weekdays are occupied periods, while all other times are unoccupied periods. Due to disturbances, it may not be possible to exactly maintain these bounds, and so we soften them and penalize their violation as a fictitious comfort cost C t com = λ δ max ( T t - T t max , 0 ) + max ( T t min - T t , 0 ) in which T t is the zone air temperature, and λ = 0.1 $/ ° C · h is the discomfort price. This value was chosen to generally prioritize comfort over cost, or more specifically, so that a constant comfort violation of 0.5 ° C would incur a penalty of $1.2 per day, which is roughly equal to the baseline electricity cost. Thus, an optimizing agent would never willingly choose such a comfort violation, as the associated penalty would completely eliminate any energy cost savings achieved in the process. Though other metrics such as PMV or PPD can be used to evaluating thermal comfort, their calculation requires additional parameters that come with significant uncertainty. If values for those parameters are known, they could be used to back-calculate an appropriate temperature range. However, in the interest of simplicity, we adopt fixed upper and lower temperature bounds corresponding to typical building operation. Energy cost is calculated on a monthly basis as the sum of use charges and peak demand charges. At each timestep, the total building power is calculated as W t = η q t + W t 0 in which q t is the zone cooling load, which is (indirectly) controllable by the agent, and W t 0 is the base electricity load of the building due to lighting and plug loads, which is constant regardless of the agent\u2019s actions. Note that η is a scale factor (i.e., the inverse of coefficient of performance) to convert from thermal cooling load to the corresponding electricity consumption, and it is assumed to be constant for simplicity. Use charges are given by C t use = ρ t W t δ in which ρ t is the (known) time-varying electricity price (in $/kWh) and W t is the average building electric power (in kW) over time period t. For the peak demand charge, the time period is split into non-overlapping months, with t t start and t t end giving the starting and ending indices for the month containing time t. Each month, the charge is assessed based on the maximum 15-min average electricity consumption, which can be calculated as Demand Charge = ρ dem max t t start ⩽ t \u2032 ⩽ t t end W \u203e t \u2032 , W \u203e t : = 1 15 ∑ t \u2032 = t t + 14 W t \u2032 Note that because this maximization is performed over the total building power (as would be the case in a real building), agents can fill in the nightly troughs of W t 0 with additional q t without increasing the overall demand charge, which provides an extra source of cost savings. Unfortunately, this calculation is not consistent with the definition of the MDP reward function (which must be summed over time), and thus we must reformulate [22]. To start, we calculate the maximum recursively by defining W t peak = W \u203e t if t = t t start max ( W t - 1 peak , W \u203e t ) else At the end of the month (i.e., when t = t t end ), we thus have that ρ dem W t peak = ρ dem max t t start ⩽ t \u2032 ⩽ t t end W \u203e t \u2032 = Demand Charge consistent with the definition above. We then split this monthly charge into per-timestep installments via the following transformation: C t dem = ρ dem α t W t peak - α t - 1 W t - 1 peak , α t : = t + 1 - t t start t t end - t t start The sum of these terms over a month is telescoping: e.g., for t t start = 1 and t t end = T , we have ∑ t \u2032 = 1 T C t \u2032 dem = ρ dem ( α T W T peak - α 0 W 0 peak ) = ρ dem W T peak since α T = 1 and α 0 = 0 . Thus, over the course of a month the sum is precisely that month\u2019s peak demand charges, which means they can be assessed as a standard MDP reward function. We consider two different cases for the prices ρ t and ρ dem from Wisconsin Electricity Rates as follows [43]: With demand charge \u2022 ρ t = 0.07842 $ / kWh weekdays 9 amto 9 pm 0.05622 $ / kWh otherwise \u2022 ρ dem = 15.65 $ / kW Without demand charge \u2022 ρ t = 0.20101 $ / kWh weekdays 9 amto 9 pm 0.09137 $ / kWh otherwise \u2022 ρ dem = 0 $ / kW The first case generally incentivizes load flattening (via the demand charge), while the second case more strongly incentivizes load shifting. The total cost function is the sum of the terms for comfort, use charges, and peak demand charges as follows: C t = C t com + C t use + C t dem The MDP reward function R is simply the negation of this cost. These values are summed over the simulation period to calculate the total cost associated with a given policy. Note, however that for the purposes of analysis, we wish to focus only on the electricity cost associated with the controllable action q t and exclude the cost due to the baseline load W t 0 . Thus, when reporting results, we subtract from this value the hypothetical baseline electricity cost (which is calculated using the same equations for C t use and C t dem as above but assuming constant q t ≡ 0 ). Because this modification is simply a constant shift in the overall objective function, optimal behavior is not changed, and so it can safely be performed as a post-processing step. 4.3 Observations and actions At each timestep, the system\u2019s observation includes the following measurements from the most recent agent timestep (i.e., every Δ = 15 min ): zone air temperature T, outside air temperature T out , cloudiness p c , cooling load q, time of day h, and day of week d. Notably, the observation does not include any measurement of the mass temperature or the thermal load disturbances affecting the system. Thus, the system is only partially observed, and agents must infer the effect of these quantities via time correlations and the available measurements. In addition to recent measurements, the observation includes future forecasts T out , p c , and W 0 (i.e., the base electricity load) up to 12 h in advance for the purposes of planning. The remaining parameters in the cost function (i.e., λ , δ , T max , T min , p t , p dem , and η ) are all either constant or follow fixed weekly cycles, and they are considered known to the agent. The only action we consider in this work is zone temperature setpoint, T sp , which is input to the local PI controller associated with the simplified zone. Its value is subject to constant bounds of 20 \u2013 26 ° C . As discussed above, the provided setpoints are held constant for Δ = 15 min . 4.4 Rule-Based Policies As a basis of comparison, we consider two simple rule-based policies that correspond to a fixed weekly setpoint schedule. When defining these policies, care is taken to avoid small comfort violations due to the transient dynamics imposed by the PI controller. For example, at 7 am on weekdays, the upper comfort limit tightens from 26 ° C to 24 ° C . If the temperature setpoint is lowered exactly at 7 am, then the zone would spend up to 60 min outside the comfort zone while the PI controller cools to the new setpoint. This small violation would likely be tolerated in a real building. However, because of the large comfort penalty λ , this behavior would create a trivial source of energy savings for the RL policies were they simply to learn to drop the setpoint at 6am. Similarly, at 5 pm on weekdays, the upper comfort limit loosens from 24 ° C to 26 ° C . Were the temperature setpoint increased by the full 2 ° C exactly at 5 pm, the PI controller dynamics would cause a slight overshoot of the comfort region, leading to another small penalty. As before, this would provides a trivial source of cost savings for agents that learn to raise the setpoint more slowly. By avoiding such behavior in the rule-based policies, we ensure that any improved performance achieved by an RL agent is due to actual problem insight and not just exploitation of an artificial gimmick. We note that we do not regard this additional complexity as an improvement over existing operation but rather as a necessary ad hoc modification to allow fair evaluation of the RL strategies being developed. The first policy attempts to minimize instantaneous energy consumption at all times by keeping the setpoint as high as possible, with some minor dynamic adjustments to avoid comfort violations. A naive version of this strategy would be to simply choose T sp ≡ T max at all times. However, as discussed above, this choice would lead to comfort violations at the beginning and end of the occupied period. Thus, to avoid this behavior, the setpoint schedule is generated as follows, with t representing the slower agent timestep (i.e., Δ = 15 min ): \u2022 Calculate the target setpoint T t ∗ : = min t \u2032 = t , \u2026 c , t + 3 T t \u2032 max . \u2022 If T t ∗ ⩽ T t - 1 sp , set T t sp = T t ∗ ; otherwise, set T sp = ( T t - 1 sp + T t ∗ ) / 2 . Here, the target setpoint T t ∗ gives the most stringent upper comfort limit over the next hour. If this target is lower than the previous setpoint, the policy steps immediately to the target to ensure the system has sufficient time to reach it. However, if the target is higher than the previous setpoint, the setpoint is increased only halfway to the target, which avoids comfort violations due to controller overshoot, which would occur if the setpoint were increased directly to the target. We refer to this as the \u201cBaseline\u201d policy, as it is largely representative of typical building operation [44,16,25], with minor additional complexity to avoid comfort penalties. Because the previous baseline policy makes no attempt to leverage peak/off-peak electricity price difference, we propose an alternative rule-based that attempts to capture those benefits. As in the previous case, a naive strategy would be to simply set T sp = T min when ρ t is low and T sp = T max when ρ t is high. However, these abrupt changes would lead to comfort violations as before, which would again provide a trivial source of cost savings. Thus, we make similar modifications to arrive at the following algorithm: \u2022 If ρ t is at its high value, set the target setpoint to T t ∗ : = min t \u2032 = t , \u2026 c , t + 3 T t \u2032 max ; otherwise, set the target setpoint to T t ∗ : = max t \u2032 = t , \u2026 c , t + 3 T t \u2032 min . \u2022 Set the setpoint to T t sp : = 0.65 T t ∗ + 0.35 T t - 1 sp . In words, when electricity is cheap, we move the setpoint towards its lowest comfortable value, while when electricity is expensive, we move the setpoint to its highest comfortable value. To avoid overshoot caused by abrupt transitions, the signal is filtered before sending to the PI controller. This policy causes the mass temperature to be significantly reduced overnight, thus reducing the cooling load needed to maintain a comfortable air temperature during the day by serving as a heat sink. We refer to this policy as \u201cAggressive\u201d as it represents the maximum possible amount of pre-cooling without violating comfort bounds. 5 Proposed approach While DRL is a very powerful general paradigm to learn to look ahead and try to maximize future rewards, the current training algorithms and techniques are often in practice constrained by lack of availability of large amount of training samples (that span across different states and actions), imperfect reward assignment schemes (assigning suboptimal rewards and penalties for actions taken in different states) and the length of the reward horizon (the longer the horizon, less effect a future reward has on the Q-network\u2019s learning in the current state) [45]. In this paper, we try to develop a DRL solution for real world building HVAC control deployment. In successful applications of RL [16], hundreds of thousands, if not millions of samples (that provide a good coverage of the state-action space) are used to train the Q-network. One way to get this amount of data samples is to build a good model of the building (using EnergyPlus [17], for example) and run simulations to obtain synthetic data. However, we are looking for a solution that is scalable (not requiring modeling experts for every building) and can be deployed across buildings, which means we cannot assume the existence of a well-calibrated simulation model. In this sense, the simulator is regarded as the real building, which means it cannot be used to generate arbitrary amounts of off-line data to train the Q-network as proposed in other literature studies. Furthermore, the costs associated with random exploration must be included in the evaluation of each policy, since electricity bills must still be paid during this period. Thus in this work, we evaluate the full life-cycle cost of DRL, which is critical to practical deployment. 5.1 Customized DQN Before discussing the customized DQN in detail, the overall training and evaluation diagram is shown in Fig. 1 . It is noted that the system states cannot be fully observed in practice and measurements are used to estimate, though s is adopted in the diagram for conceptual illustration. This diagram is adapted from a similar one in [16], while differing particularly in the action processor, reward shaping, and model selection. The action processor requires the time information (e.g., weekday or weekend, morning or afternoon) to process the raw action delivered by the Q-network in either the training or evaluation phase. Reward shaping is mainly developed to overcome the issue of reward sparsity caused by the occasional demand charge. Model selection is used to choose the best set of weights for the Q-network from the training data. We present more details next regarding them. 5.2 Action processor Given the limited amount of data available and other constraints mentioned above regarding training DRL, it becomes important to utilize any prior information to improve the performance of the Q-network. For our system, we note that there are certain \u201cpeak hours\u201d of the day that have an outsized impact on the cost function, due to both the higher electricity price and the larger base electricity loads (which means peak demand is likely to be set in those time periods). Thus, optimal solutions will generally consume as little energy as possible to maintain comfort, which is accomplished by choosing a setpoint equal to the upper comfort limit. Even during early \u201doff-peak\u201d hours, choosing a setpoint equal to the upper comfort limit is expected to consume less energy than energy consumed for any other setpoint. This observation motivates the development of an action processor as follows. Fig. 2 shows how the action processor works in the proposed approach. Let a t denote the raw control action output by the agent at time step t, and let a ̂ t be the processed action sent to the system. During a set of hours (which will be specified in the experiments), we set a ̂ t = φ ( a t , t ) = T t max to minimize short-term energy use, taking a ̂ t = φ ( a t , t ) = a t from the agent at other times. The reward from the action recommended by the action processor is used to train the Q-network in future time steps. This reward will be higher than the reward corresponding to sub-optimal actions and the Q-network can be trained to learn the optimal actions during the portions of the day (typically late afternoons and early during the weekends). It is also known that abrupt drops in temperature set-points, during cooling, lead to power surges. The action processor can be used to cushion drops by forcing fixed set-points (when the recommended set-point is lower than the previous set-point, using the action processor to maintain the fixed lower set-point for an hour before allowing for any further drop in set-point). The action processor is used both while training the Q-network as well as during inference. 5.3 Reward shaping According to the cost function shown in Section 4, the reward (negative cost) comprises three parts: comfort cost C com , use charge C use , and demand charge C dem , for each time step t. Most challenging to deal with is C dem : although the formulation presented in Section 4.2 is exact (in the sense that it exactly splits the monthly demand charge across all timesteps in each month), it can have very large spikes in value corresponding to time points where the monthly peak is increased (i.e., when W t peak increases). Fig. 3 shows an instance plot for the reward signal for six months under the Baseline policy, and the spikes in C dem are quite evident. We have found that using the demand cost directly as the reward is not sufficient for the RL agent to learn to reduce the demand charge. We have investigated a few reward shaping techniques including prioritized experience replay [46], dual-experience replay buffers (one buffer for sequential experiences and one buffer containing only those experiences when the demand charge is dominant), reward-valley-penalize-peak (a scheme where actions leading to power consumptions that are close to the current monthly peak are penalized more compared to actions that have power consumptions much below the peak), and reward-below-threshold. Among these techniques, we have found the reward-below-threshold approach to be the most effective in terms of cost improvement compared to the baseline method. Intuitively, it is to reward the actions that would lead to normalized power consumption that does not exceed a fixed threshold, which can be expressed as (5) r = - ζ ( C t com + C t use ) + c I ( W t , nor - W ~ nor ) where ζ is a scaling factor, c is the pre-defined large penalty constant, I ( · ) is an indicator function (i.e., I ( x ) = 1 if x > 0 and I ( x ) = 0 otherwise), W t , nor is the normalized power consumption, and W ~ nor is the threshold. We chose a threshold value corresponding to the average daytime power consumption. The current monthly peak power consumption and the most recent 15 min power consumption values are added as extra elements to the input vector of the Q-network for the demand charge experiments. 5.4 Model selection Successful Q-learning applications in the literature employ tens of thousands of samples for training the Q-network. This allows the Q-network to fully explore the state-action space and learn the behavior to maximize the reward over the long term. However, in our practical setting, there are inherent limitations to the amount of random exploration that can be performed, both due to the high electricity costs caused by such actions and due to the finite evaluation period. Thus, agents must be able to learn in real time and identify high-performance policies quickly enough to be able to realize their benefits. There are two approaches to handle this situation. The first approach is to train the Q-network by randomly exploring within comfort bounds (to maximize learning at the expense of higher cost) for a fixed amount of time (called the \u201cexploration\u201d period). After this point, we freeze the weights and use them until the end of the evaluation (called the \u201cexploitation\u201d period) with no additional exploration. The other approach is to use the epsilon greedy learning method (which at each step chooses a random control action with probability ∊ and otherwise takes the action suggested by the current policy) and anneal the value of epsilon throughout the evaluation to continue learning while reducing the amount of random set points chosen. The problem with the latter approach is that every building is different and determining the right values for the hyper-parameters (epsilon and annealing rate), is a challenge. In addition, because of the structure of peak demand charges, low-frequency random actions can have a significant effect on total cost, as only one unfortunate control action could define the peak for the entire month, eliminating much of the savings achieved by the non random actions. Thus, in the interest of simplicity, we choose the former approach. Consistent with the proposed strategy, and as illustrated in Fig. 4 , we pick ten sets of candidate weights obtained after performing gradient descent by repeated sampling of the memory buffer populated at the end of the exploration period. We use a model selection criterion to choose the \u201cbest\u201d set of weights. In the ideal case, this criterion would be the actual head-to\u2013head performance of each policy in the real system over a given period of time (e.g., 1 year). Unfortunately, this strategy is unrealistic because it would require an independent copy of the system for each set of weights. A practical modification would be to evaluate each set of weights sequentially over shorter periods (e.g., 1 month), but this would take up valuable time in the exploitation period, and it is complicated by the fact that cases experience different disturbances (which can significantly impact cost). Another approach would be to build a surrogate model of the environment with the training data and use this model to evaluate the different candidate weights but of course this strategy would require significant additional modeling effort. In the interest of a thorough comparison, we employ three different model selection criteria as follows: \u2022 Ideal: simulate the policy associated with each set of weights for 1 year and choose the weights with the lowest average cost. \u2022 Bellman: choose the set of weights for which the associated Q function achieves the lowest Bellman gap (i.e., error in Eq. (1)) over the training set. \u2022 Trivial: choose the final set of weights obtained when employing conventional training (the weights obtained just after the experience replay buffer is fully populated at the end of the exploration period). Some discussion about these particular strategies is warranted. First, the \u201cIdeal\u201d criterion is precisely the ideal strategy described as \u201cunrealistic\u201d above. Thus, we report these values only to serve as a hypothetical best-case bound that could be achieved, e.g., by employing the surrogate-model approach with a highly accurate surrogate model. Second, the \u201cBellman\u201d strategy is motivated as choosing the set of weights that are \u201cmost converged\u201d or closest to being a solution to the Bellman equation Eq. (1). We know that optimal policies satisfy the equation exactly, and so in some sense, policies that are closer to solving it should perform better. Unfortunately, this property is not true in general, and it is further complicated when the cost function has been modified for reward shaping purposes. Thus, while the Bellman strategy is practical (in the sense that it can be implemented in practice), it may not yield good results across all instances. Finally, the \u201cTrivial\u201d strategy essentially represents the absence of model selection, as it simply chooses whichever set of weights happened to be encountered at the end of the exploration period while performing conventional Q-learning weight updates. Certainly, other selection criteria are possible (and some would likely yield better results), but we focus on these three for our current scope. 6 Simulation experiment 6.1 Simulation testbed To test our proposed approach on the system described in Section 4, we make use of a simplified zone simulator developed for this and other work. Internally, the simulator models the zone using a second-order linear model, with one state for the (uniform) air temperature in the zone and a second state for the (uniform) temperature of the solid mass surrounding the zone. Both states receive direct head loads from solar radiation, plug loads, and internal occupants. In addition, they exchange heat with each other and with the ambient in proportion to temperature differences. This thermal model has been successfully fit to data in real buildings [47], and parameters used in the simulations have been chosen to match those values. The PI controller is modeled in discrete time with anti-windup logic. For normalization purposes, the zone is assumed to have an area of 1000 ft2 (with a ceiling height of 12 ft). Internal heat gains and base electricity consumption are tuned to match values from real operating data. As discussed above, the simulator\u2019s internal timestep is δ = 1 min , while agents interact with a slower timestep of Δ = 15 min . Thus, the provided setpoints are held constant for 15 min. Costs are calculated on the faster timescale, but measurements are averaged and provided on the slower timescale (which is another minor source of partial observation). Weather disturbances (temperature, solar intensity, and cloudiness) are taken from hourly typical meteorological year (TMY) data for June through July in Milwaukee, WI. To provide appropriate variation over the simulation five-year simulation period, the data are extended as follows: (1) a low-order Fourier series is fit to the TMY data and subtracted from it to obtain residual values; (2) a 24-step linear autoregressive model is fit to the residuals; (3) the autoregressive model is simulated for five years using random noise with the sample variance and added to the base Fourier series. Thus, weather in successive three-month periods follows similar trends but is not exactly the same. All observed quantities (i.e., measurements and forecasts) are subject to random noise with variance and autocorrelation chosen to match that of typical real-world measurements. Otherwise, forecasts are assumed to be accurate. Although this simulation model is quite simple, it is suitable to our purposes because it captures the key air/mass timescale separation while also considering the dynamics of local regulation that are often neglected by more detailed simulators like EnergyPlus. In addition, its simplicity allows perfect-information globally optimal control actions to be computed by means of a convex optimization problem, which provides valuable insight into how and to what extent energy cost can be reduced. In particular, this idealized upper bound on performance, together with the lower bound provided by the rule-based policies, establishes the full landscape for assessment of RL performance. For example, if an RL strategy achieves almost the same cost reduction as then optimal actions, then there is little room for additional enhancement. On the other hand, if RL captures only a small fraction of optimal savings, then significant work is left to be done. Had we instead used a more detailed but blackbox simulator, this valuable context would not be available. 6.2 Perfect-information optimal policy As mentioned above, the relatively simple structure of the simulation model means that we can determine the true optimal behavior of the system by solving an exact optimal control problem with perfect knowledge of disturbances. Considering that the system model is linear and the cost function is convex, we can employ convex programming techniques to find global solutions for each month. In particular, by considering entire months within the same optimization, the peak demand charge is perfectly managed, as the optimizer is able to choose a single monthly peak demand target and stick exactly to it throughout the entire month. Because this policy requires values of the internal system parameters, it is certainly not achievable in practice. Nevertheless, it provides key insights into problem structure to help guide tuning of other techniques and serves as an ideal benchmark to which all policies should strive. It also provides an exact lower bound on system cost, which would not be available had we used a more complicated simulator. 6.3 Results and discussion This section presents the simulation results based on the simulator described above. Specifically, we first show the zone air temperature regulation using the proposed method and the corresponding electricity demand. We compare the proposed method with the rule-based and optimal policies in terms of energy cost savings. Table 1 lists values chosen for different hyper-parameters. The length of the temperature and cloudiness forecast vectors, T out and p c was set to 48 (corresponding to 12 h) for the scenario with demand charge and was set to 4 (1 h) for the scenario with no demand charge. The forecast vector length only had a marginal effect on the performance of the network with or without demand charge. As DQN works only with discrete actions, the number of the agent actions was set to 9 to provide sufficient granularity for actions within the action space (there exists a trade-off between granularity and training data available to explore the entire state-action space). This corresponds to 9 discrete values in the range between 20 ° C and 26 ° C for unoccupied periods and 22 ° C and 24 ° C for occupied periods. We used a three hidden layer, fully connected dense neural network, with exponential linear units (elu activation) for the hidden layers of the Q-network. The output layer of 9 actions was a linear layer. The input features to the Q-network consisted of time of the day (0\u201395), day of the week, current zone temperature, temperature forecast vector and cloudiness forecast vector. All input values were normalized to lie between 0 and 1. For the no demand charge experiments, the input feature vector consisted of 4 values corresponding to temperature forecast, 4 values corresponding to cloudiness forecast, the zone temperature, the time of the day and the day of the week for a total of 11 elements in the input vector. The number of hidden units was 100 in each of the hidden layers. For the case with demand charge, the input feature vector consisted of 48 values for the temperature forecast, 48 values for the cloudiness forecast, the zone temperature, the time of the day, the day of the week, the current power peak consumption and the power consumption in the most recent 15 min period for a total of 101 elements in the input vector. Once again all input elements are normalized to lie between 0 and 1. The number of hidden units was reduced to 40, 50 and 100 for the three hidden layers for the demand charge experiments so as to keep the total number of hidden units in the network similar for both sets of experiments. It took about 1 min on a single CPU modern laptop to perform gradient descent weight updates for 1 month of training data (approximately 3000 weight update steps with a batch size of 128). 6.3.1 Comparison In our experiments, we assume that the total simulation period is 5 years. To gather more exploratory data for the DQN policies, we choose an exploration period of 4 months (for cases with demand charges) or 10 months (for cases without demand charges), after which point a model selection method is used to choose a set of weights. The chosen weights are then deployed for the exploitation period, which lasts the rest of the total simulation period. The primary evaluation metric is the average cost over the full 5 years, but for illustration purposes, we also provide values for average cost over just the exploitation period. Results for each method are listed in Table 2 . Each DQN policy is identified by a number \u201c1\u201d or \u201c2\u201d (indicating whether or not the action processor was used) and a letter \u201ca\u201d, \u201cb\u201d, or \u201cc\u201d (indicating whether the Ideal, Bellman, or Trivial model selectors was used) as shown in the table. Using the Baseline policy as the benchmark, we can observe from Table 2. DQN 1a is able to save around 5% of total energy cost compared to only 3% reduction for DQN 2a, which means the action processor does help guide the DQN policies. Similar differences hold comparing DQN 1b to 2b and DQN 1c to 2c, which indicates that the action processor is always helpful to improve performance regardless of the chosen model selection criteria. Comparing the model selection strategies, the Ideal criterion performs best. This result is expected, as the strategy represents a hypothetical best-case bound. Between the remaining Bellman and Trivial criteria, there does not appear to be a clear winner, since Trivial performs slightly better with demand charges and Bellman slightly better without. The worse performance of these strategies compared to Ideal does motivate future work on better model-selection criteria, but we do note that the impact of the model selector is reduced slightly by the presence of the action processor. Comparing the DQN policies to the other policies, we see from Table 2 that in the presence of demand charges, all DQN policies outperform the Baseline and Aggressive pre-cooling policies significantly. DQN policies are able to manage reasonably well the time to pre-cool the zone in the early morning when electricity is cheaper, thereby reducing expensive afternoon consumption and lowering peak demand. By contrast, the Baseline policy completely ignores variation in electricity price, and the Aggressive strategy delivers the maximum possible amount of pre-cooling without making any attempt to manage peak demand in the aggressive pre-cooling policy. However, when demand charges are not present, the Aggressive policy now out-performs the DQN policies, which indicates that the DQN agents are not able to identify the full extent of pre-cooling that is possible in these scenarios. As expected, the Optimal policy performs best since it gets access to the perfect system information. We see that the optimal policy saves less energy cost without demand charges, which indicates that lowering peak demand is a key component of the total cost savings when present. To examine performance results in more detail, we show two weeks of operating data for various policies in Figs. 5\u20138 . In addition, the temperature setpoints for each policy are overlaid in Fig. 9 . All of these cases include peak demand charges. In the Fig. 5, we see that the Baseline policy consumes the most electricity during peak hours, which leads to high total cost. Comparing with Fig. 6, we see that DQN 1 is able to reduce peak demand via pre-cooling. We do notice that the policy includes seemingly random setpoint changes in the morning. Such agent behavior may indicate incomplete learning within the exploratory period. This effect is exacerbated for DQN 2 in Fig. 7, due to its lack of the action processor. Thus, stabilization of setpoints is another benefit provided by the action processor. Analyzing the Optimal policy in Fig. 8 reveals that maximum cost savings are achieved when total-building electricity consumption stays near its peak for a large portion of the day. Specifically, the flatness of the total electricity profile means that the policy is able to identify the optimal peak value for electricity, and then it chooses to stay there for much of the month. However, such performance is likely unachievable in practice, as disturbance forecasts will not be accurate enough. Finally, examining all the setpoint trajectories together in Fig. 9 illustrates that DQN 1 stays near the Optimal policy (especially during peak hours) due to the action processor, whereas DQN 2 wanders quite far from it and thus results in higher cost. For the cases without demand charges, DQN agent behavior is qualitatively the same as before. Thus, in the interest of brevity, we show only the Optimal policy in Fig. 10 and compare setpoints in Fig. 11 . We see first that the removal of the peak demand charge means that the Optimal policy need no longer achieve a flat peak demand, and so it can aggressively pre-cool each day. In Fig. 11, we see that the DQN policies still yield random fluctuations in setpoint. For DQN 2, one can again observe that without the action processor, additional energy is consumed due to the randomness of setpoints, particularly during the night times and on weekends. Looking back at, Table 2 we see that the worst overall performance is achieved by DQN 2c, with this phenomena actually leading to worse performance than the Baseline policy. Thus, agents with an action processor or a (nontrivial) model selector should be used to avoid this behavior. Before concluding this subsection, we discuss how the proposed scheme may react to data distribution drift. If the Q-network encounters measurement data outside the bounds of what it has been trained on, it is going to extrapolate and decide what the temperature setpoint should be. This Q-network may still be able to suggest a reasonable setpoint. In the event the measurement data is totally unexpected, we are still guaranteed to select a setpoint within comfort bounds as the Q-network actions are constrained to fall between the upper and lower comfort bounds. In an extreme scenario where the measurement data begins to repeatedly show different behavior, the Q-network may require re-training using newly collected data. However, this re-training is expected to be a fine-tuning of the previously trained network. 6.3.2 Impact of hyper-parameters Hyper-parameters typically play a significant role in Q-network performance. If we relax the expectation for a smooth Q-network convergence and choose the model selection approach mentioned in Section 5 to select the trained weights, we find that only a few hyper-parameters play an important role. The hyper-parameters chosen in this work are listed in Table 1. The optimizer & learning rate have a reasonable impact on the DQN performance. The reward scaling factor and threshold defined in Eq. (5) are two other hyper-parameters found to have a reasonable impact on the performance, especially in the presence of demand charges. 6.3.3 Limitations In this work, we have shown using a simulator that with only limited amount of historical data, the proposed customized DRL approach can outperform the baseline. However, compared to the optimal policy that leverages the perfect knowledge of the disturbances, there is still a performance gap. Use of a surrogate model for generating additional training data and transfer learning mentioned in the future work section could help bridge the gap to some extent. Incorporating additional prior knowledge into the action processor and employing better reward schemes can also help. There may also be more fundamental approaches that could be looked into to improve the performance when the available training data is limited. 7 Conclusions and future work In this paper, we have investigated using reinforcement learning to the problem of obtaining energy cost savings within buildings in the presence of time-varying electricity price profile and demand charge. This problem continues to be a challenging one in building HVAC systems. We have proposed improvements to a traditional DQN that include an action processor, model selection and reward shaping techniques for dealing with limited training data and the issue of sparse reward caused by the monthly demand charge. Via numerical experiments using a simplified zone simulator, we demonstrated that our approach was effective to save energy cost, compared to two practical rule-based policies. Continuing on the results reported here, we see three future avenues of work. The first one is studying the performance of the designed approach when deployed to a real test-bed. The second one is to study the performance of the proposed approach by building a surrogate model using the training data to improve the sample efficiency (by generating more training samples from the surrogate model). A third direction of work would be to look at transferring the learned Q-network weights from one building to another and updating weights from this starting point as opposed to learning weights from scratch for each new building.

        "dc:description": "Energy efficiency remains a significant topic in the control of building heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, and diverse set of control strategies have been developed to optimize performance, including recently emerging techniques of deep reinforcement learning (DRL). While most existing works have focused on minimizing energy consumption, the generalization to energy cost minimization under time-varying electricity price profiles and demand charges has rarely been studied. Under these utility structures, significant cost savings can be achieved by pre-cooling buildings in the early morning when electricity is cheaper, thereby reducing expensive afternoon consumption and lowering peak demand. However, correctly identifying these savings requires planning horizons of one day or more. To tackle this problem, we develop Deep Q-Network (DQN) with an action processor, defining the environment as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) with a reward function consisting of energy cost (time-of-use and peak demand charges) and a discomfort penalty, which is an extension of most reward functions used in existing DRL works in this area. Moreover, we develop a reward shaping technique to overcome the issue of reward sparsity caused by the demand charge. Through a single-zone building simulation platform, we demonstrate that the customized DQN outperforms the baseline rule-based policy, saving close to 6% of total cost with demand charges, while close to 8% without demand charges.",
