Graphical abstract Rapid growth in global energy consumption has raised concern on the environmental impacts such as ozone layer depletion and climate change. Enclosed space, such as commercial buildings, accounts for about 40% of global energy consumption and the demand is constantly increasing due to increasing population, urbanization, and economic development. The energy demands in the building sector calls for strategic measures to develop energy efficient technologies. This paper presents a strategy to decrease energy demands inside buildings by proposing a ventilation system which regulates the enclosed air quality resulting in reduced air conditioning. The system consists of multiple adsorption beds with zeolite 13X monoliths for CO2 removal, and silica gel for humidity control, inside the enclosed space. The air conditioning system results in decrease in energy requirement and improvement in economics by 55% as compared with conventional ventilation system. The model is scaled up to the size comparable with total office inventory of New York City, and the reduction in carbon emissions by introducing the air composition control system for New York City is equivalent to replacing 57 million incandescent light bulbs by LEDs. This paper concludes that the air conditioning system proposed in this study results in the improvement in performance as compared to a conventional ventilation system and could reduce energy consumption inside commercial buildings.

The rising levels of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere poses a serious threat to climate stability. Globally, enclosed environments, such as the building sector accounts for more than 30% of the total CO2 emissions [1]. In most developed countries, the building sector is the largest consumer of total energy, which is even larger than the industry and transportation sectors combined. For example, the energy consumption from buildings in the United States and European Union is between 20 and 40 % of the total energy usage [2,3] resulting in approximately 1 Gigatonne of carbon dioxide released in the atmosphere per year. Further, the energy demand is steadily increasing in this sector due to population and economic growth and shifts in climate [4,5]. Hence, reducing the carbon footprint of buildings by increasing their energy efficiency is a priority to mitigate future anthropogenic emissions. Several energy saving strategies have been proposed in the existing literature [6 \u201310]. One such strategy is to optimize the usage of HVAC systems inside buildings [11 \u201313]. HVAC consumption accounts for half the energy use in the building sector and one fifth of the total national energy use in the developed countries [14]. Primary reason for HVAC to be the largest consumer is the need to maintain a comfortable and workable environment inside buildings. Temperature and air quality are the two important parameters that needs to be controlled for maximizing human comfort inside the buildings. While the former can be adjusted through air conditioning units [15] and particulate filters reduce suspended matter, it is difficult to maintain air quality inside buildings. Specific air quality standards need to be maintained inside buildings to ensure that the air quality does not poses a threat to health of people inside the enclosed space. In particular, controlling CO2, O2 and humidity level inside buildings is of critical importance to regulate the air quality. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) defines critical O2 concentration inside enclosed space as 19.5%. It states that any atmosphere with an oxygen level below 19.5% is oxygen deficient and possess immediate danger to life and health. Studies have shown health risks associated with high CO2 concentration (greater than0.5%) [16,17]. People may suffer headache, nausea, fatigue and listlessness when exposed to high CO2 concentration for prolonged duration. Furthermore, regulating humidity level inside buildings is also of critical importance. It is recommended to maintain the indoor relative humidity level between 30 and 60%. Humidity level less than 30% can cause dryness of skin and respiratory discomfort, while higher humidity than 60% can promote growth of molds and fungi [18,19]. Better air quality leads to improved human productivity [20]. The conventional method of regulating the air quality is through ventilation. However, such techniques are not energy efficient for enclosed space because significant energy is spent in conditioning the outside air. There have been limited studies on artificial CO2 and humidity control inside buildings [21]. A study by Lee et al. [22] proposes removal of CO2 from indoor air through electric swing adsorption using carbon monoliths as adsorbing agents. Their work supports regulating CO2 concentration is an important factor in energy consumption. Lee et al. [23] proposed CO2 adsorption by zeolite impregnated with amines and demonstrated that the adsorbent had excellent adsorption potential for removing CO2 from indoor air. However, amine leaching could be a major issue in enclosed environment, hampering its deployment. Recently, there has been an increased interest in implementing novel ventilation strategies inside enclosed environments [24 \u201326]. In a study by Kim et al. [27], a novel ventilation strategy has been proposed which helps in saving energy inside building by CO2 capture through adsorption method for the climates in Singapore and Zurich. Cui et al. [28] proposed a hybrid air treatment system which consists of an ozone-based oxidation process and an air scrubbing device. Their system shows improvement in performance compared to conventional ventilation systems. However, their system poses limitation due to large footprint required for the air treatment system. CO2 removal from buildings offers some advantages. First, because of the higher CO2 concentration than in the ambient air (approximately 400 ppm), the driving force for separation from buildings is higher than that in direct air capture. Further, air inside buildings is cleaner compared to flue gases. However, removal of CO2 from buildings is more challenging than CO2 capture from flue gas due to low concentration gradient driving force. Thakkar et al. [29] fabricated three dimensional (3D)- printed 13X zeolite monoliths and reported their use in CO2 removal from air in enclosed environments. The 3D monolith showed mechanical stability that can prevent attrition and dusting issues and can be used as a cost-effective approach for gas separation processes. The studies described above provide useful insights into improving energy efficiency and air quality inside buildings. However, there has not been any previous study which examines the energy and cost of H2O, CO2 and O2 control system inside an enclosed environment through control simulation of adsorption process. Further, usage of a zeolite based monolithic system has also never been explored before for maintaining air quality inside an enclosed space. In addition, previous research focused on controlling only one of the components of the air (CO2, O2 or humidity). This paper aims to bridge this gap by controlling all the three air components through a novel air composition control and reduced ventilation strategy. This strategy is based on concentration swing adsorption of CO2 on zeolite 13X monoliths and temperature swing adsorption of water on silica gel packed beds. The system is specifically designed and modeled to minimize the rate of external ventilation, which is targeted to control the oxygen level inside the room. The original engineering contributions of this study include: \u2022 Modeling and simulation of a unique multi-component, multi-bed model keeping realistic constraints on CO2, O2 and humidity level through different beds. \u2022 Highlighting the challenges and new findings in terms of the energy and cost-efficient performance of the proposed strategy by comparing it with the conventional ventilation methods. \u2022 Presenting a scale-up study and analysis of the carbon footprint of the proposed system. \u2022 Analyzing the influence of uncertainties in the model of the air composition control system. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of the multi-component, multi-bed model, highlighting the methodology used for each of the beds. It also provides methodology and equations for estimating energy and cost requirements. Section 3 presents the results of the paper. This section compares the performance of the multi-bed system with conventional ventilation methods and presents carbon footprint of both the methods. Section 4 concludes the paper by summarizing the potential benefits of proposed strategy over the conventional strategy, its impact on global CO2 reduction and possible areas for future research. 2 Process description 2.1 System design 2.1.1 Overview In the current study, we propose a multi-component, multi-bed air composition control system within HVAC unit, which aims at controlling CO2, O2, humidity level and temperature inside a room of a building. Fig. 1 depicts the overview of the air composition control system and HVAC unit inside a room. A sample room is considered, assuming people occupancy during office hours (9 AM \u2013 5 PM) inside the room. Air composition control system consists of CO2 capture system and dehumidification units. CO2 capture system utilizes concentration swing adsorption process to remove the CO2 build-up inside the room. Humidity level is maintained through a pair of dehumidification units, Dehumidifier 1 and 2. The HVAC unit maintains oxygen level and temperature inside the room through external ventilation, heating and air conditioning. 2.1.2 CO2 removal system The CO2 removal system consists of honeycomb zeolite 13X monoliths made by a 3D printer as shown in Fig. 2 . The size of the monolithic structure (channel diameter, cell density, length, etc.) is chosen according to the volume of the room, adsorption capacity of the adsorbent material, and the number of people present inside the room such that CO2 concentration inside the room is maintained below the desired level (set in this study as 0.5% or 5000 ppm). Fig. 3 shows the adsorption process for CO2 removal through a single monolithic channel, which is used in a cyclic operation. The CO2 removal cycle consists of two steps, adsorption and desorption. During the adsorption step, air from the room which is rich in CO2 is fed through the front end of the monolithic channel. The adsorbent captures the CO2, and the treated air leaves from the rear end of the channel. Total time for this step is termed as adsorption time. After the adsorption step is completed, the desorption step begins, where air at ambient conditions (∼25C and CO2 concentrations of around 400 ppm) is fed to the channel. This forces the adsorbed CO2 in the zeolite to desorb since the equilibrium CO2 concentration decreases with decrease in partial pressure of CO2 in the gas phase at the same temperature (as can be seen in the isotherm plot in Fig. 6). Hence, due to concentration difference, the adsorbent desorbs the CO2 and the air rich in CO2 comes out from the rear end of the channel. Total time for this step is termed as desorption time. The total time for one cycle, which consists of adsorption and desorption steps, is termed as the cycle time. 2.1.3 Air composition control system schematic The air composition control system consists of CO2 removal system (discussed above) and dehumidification system. Fig. 4 a shows the CO2 adsorption step. In this step CO2 rich air from the room is fed to the dehumidifier 1, a bed packed with silica gel, which removes moisture from the feed air. This unit is necessary since the capacity of the CO2 adsorbent, zeolite 13X, used downstream in the system decreases when exposed to humid conditions [30]. The product from dehumidifier 1, dry air rich in CO2, is supplied to the CO2 removal system. From the monoliths (that adsorb the CO2), the dry air which is depleted in CO2 is recycled back to the room. To maintain the room humidity level, which would drop due to continuous removal of humidity by dehumidifier 1, humid air is supplied to the room by dehumidifier 2 which undergoes regeneration. The flow from dehumidifier 2 is controlled so that humidity inside the room is always within a desired range. Fig. 4 b shows the CO2 desorption step. In this step, outside air with low CO2 concentration (∼400 ppm) is dried up by dehumidifier 1, and then fed to CO2 removal system. From the CO2 removal system, CO2 desorbs by the driving force of CO2 concentration difference and leaves the system. In this step, Dehumidifier 2 continues to maintain the humidity level inside the room through regeneration. 2.1.4 Process operating strategy The operating strategy of the air composition control system is shown in Fig. 5 . The concentration of CO2 inside the room increases due to human metabolism from 9 am until 5 pm. The air composition control system is turned on during this time frame to perform the cyclic CO2 adsorption\u2013desorption steps. During this timeframe, the HVAC unit operates with an external ventilation to control O2 level inside the room. The ventilation rate during this time frame is less than that of a conventional HVAC system (without the air composition control system) because the HVAC unit in this strategy does not have to bear the additional cost of controlling CO2 levels inside the room through additional air flow. The ventilation rate (V.R.) required with air composition control system in operation is termed as Reduced V.R. The air composition control system is switched off from 5 pm until 7 pm to reduce the operation cost as discussed later (Section 4.2) and switched on again after 7 pm. After 7 pm, with no human occupancy, external ventilation is further reduced in the HVAC unit. The ventilation rate required during this time frame is termed as No-Occupancy V.R. The air composition control system continues to run until the CO2 level is brought back to its initial conditions, around 3 am. After that time, air composition control system is switched off and ventilation continues at No-Occupancy V.R. level till 9 am of the next day. At the start of next day operation (9 am), the saturated dehumidifier 1 is inter-changed with regenerated dehumidifier 2. As seen later in the results section, the proposed strategy ensures that the CO2, O2 and humidity level inside the room is maintained within desired ranges. In this study, we employ the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) standards [17]. 2.1.5 Model equations We make the following assumptions: \u2022 The regular human occupancy inside the room is assumed to be 8 h (9 AM \u2013 5 PM) per day. \u2022 The gases inside the room are well mixed. \u2022 Ideal gas law is assumed for non-condensable components. Based on the above assumptions, a mathematical model is developed to describe the dynamics of the multi-component, multi-bed system. The model consists of heat and mass transfer equations for the sample room, CO2 removal monolithic system [31] and packed bed dehumidification system [32]. The details regarding modeling complex heat and mass transfer equations for monoliths and packed bed systems can be found in the supporting information. The gas concentration dynamics inside the room is modeled using Eq. (1). (1) V 1 d C i , R dt = R i + F R C i , i n - F R C i , R + F M C i , M - F M C i , D where, V1 is the room volume (m3), R is the perspiration/respiration rate of healthy adult (mol/s), C is the concentration of i th gas component (mol/m3) and F is the gas flow rate (m3/s). The subscript R, M and D represents the room, monolith outlet and dehumidifier outlet respectively. The mass transfer rates between the gas and solid (adsorbent) phases for CO2 and H2O are approximated by a linear driving force model provided in Eq. (2). (2) ∂ Q i , j ∂ t = K i , j ( Q i , j eq - Q i , j ) where, Q i is adsorbed gas concentration for i th component (CO2, H2O), Ki is the overall mass transfer coefficient (determined in section 4.1.2) and Q i eq is the equilibrium concentration of the i th component as determined by the isotherm equations (eq. (12)). The subscript j is for both monolith (j = M) and packed bed dehumidification unit (j = D), respectively. The heat of adsorption for CO2 is determined using the Clausius − Clapeyron equation at 25, 50, and 75 °C. It is calculated to be 57.5 kJ/mol for zeolite 13X monolith in Section 3.2.1. Table 1 lists the values of parameters used in the model (additional details can be found in the supporting information). The model is implemented in gPROMS version 4.0. The model is solved by discretizing the axial and radial domain using the second order centered finite difference method (CFDM). The method of lines is used to solve the partial differential algebraic equations, and the DASOLV integrator is used to solve the resulting equations. 2.2 Estimation of energy and cost 2.2.1 Energy estimates The HVAC system requires energy for the air conditioners to condition the externally ventilated air, and the air composition control system requires energy for blowers to flow the air through monolithic and dehumidification units (both for adsorption and desorption step). The air composition control system also requires energy for regeneration of saturated dehumidification unit. The energy requirement (in Joules) due to blowers is provided in Eq. (3). (3) E Blower = η Δ P q air t Blower where, q air is the volumetric flow of air through the air composition control units in m3/s and t Blower is the time of operation of the blower. Δ P is the pressure drop (pascals) across the air composition control system given by Ergun equation (Eq. (4)) and η is the efficiency, assumed to be 65%. (4) Δ P L = 150 μ ( 1 - ε ) 2 v ε 2 d p 2 + 1.75 ( 1 - ε ) ρ v 2 ε 3 d p where μ is the viscosity of air, ε is void space of the bed, v is the air velocity, dp is the particle diameter and ρ is the density of air. The energy requirement (in Joules) for regeneration of saturated dehumidification unit is provided in Eq. (5). (5) E Regen = Δ H H 2 O n H 2 O where Δ H is the H2O heat of adsorption (kJ/mole) and nH2O is the total moles of H2O removed from the dehumidification units. The energy requirement of an air conditioner consists of sensible heat and latent heat. Sensible heat is required to bring the temperature of external air in equilibrium with the room temperature. The energy requirement (in Joules) due to sensible heat (Es ) is given by Eq. (6). (6) E s = C p , a i r ρ air q air \u2033 Δ T where C p , a i r is the specific heat of air, ρ air is the density of air, q \u2019\u2019 air is the volumetric flow of air through the air conditioners and Δ T is the temperature difference between external air and enclosed space. In addition, latent heat is required to maintain the moisture content inside the room. The energy requirement (in Joules) due to latent heat (EL ) is given by Eq. (7). (7) E s = C p , a i r ρ air q air \u2033 Δ T where Lw is the latent heat of vaporization of water and d w kg is the humidity ratio difference (kg water/kg of dry air) which can be estimated using the psychrometric chart or the Mollier diagram. The humidity ratio difference is between the air present inside the enclosed space (including the moisture loaded added from room occupants) and the external environment. During summer where the cooling load of air conditioners is taken into account, water condensation occurs, and thus cooling load consists of the sum of the sensible heat and latent heat. On the other hand, during winter where the heating load is taken into account, water condensation is negligible, and thus the heating load consists only of the sensible heat. 2.2.2 Cost estimates The total cost can be divided into operating and capital cost. The operating cost consist of electrical cost for operating the blowers (CB ), regenerating saturated dehumidification unit and the air conditioner (CAC ). This can be calculated using Eq. (8), 9 and 10 respectively. (8) C B = E Blower C E (9) C R = E Regen C E (10) C AC = ( E s + E L ) C E where, Eblower , ERegen , Es and EL are energy requirements of blowers, regeneration, sensible and latent heat respectively (converted from Joules to kW-hr), and CE ($/kW-hr) is the cost of electricity which is assumed around 7 cents per kW-hr [42]. The capital cost consists of blowers, 3D monoliths and two dehumidification units. In order to express the capital cost on the same basis as operating cost, we annualize the capital cost. The annualized capital cost can be computed using Eq. (11). (11) C i = C P , i t cycle N yr t LT , i where, Ci is the capital cost of i th component (monolith, blower and silica gel packed bed), CP,i is the purchase cost of the i th component, tcycle is the cycle time (600 s), Nyr is the number of cycles each year and tLT,i is the life time of the i th component. The lifetime of monoliths is assumed to be 1 year and for blowers and the dehumidifier beds packed with silica gel, the lifetime is assumed to be 5 years. The purchase cost of monolith is $78/kg based on raw material, labor, and production cost with 11 kg of the monolith used (based on the system requirement). The purchase cost of silica gel dehumidification units is assumed to be $32/kg with 60 kg used (based on the system requirement). Data from Sigma-Aldrich is used to obtain the lab scale prices and it is converted to bulk scale prices (purchase cost) for capital cost estimations [43]. The purchase costs of monolith and dehumidification unit also includes equipment cost (around 4x the raw cost of the material) to fabricate the monolith/packed-bed and sorbent into a device and installation cost (additional multiplier factor of 4). The blower purchase cost calculations can be found at Sinha et.al. [31]. We would expect to use the usual filters in the AC system which would remove particulates down to a certain size. It is possible that particles that make it through the usual duct filters would end up in the monolith and cause fouling. This fouling is most likely reversible during maintenance by increased forced air flow, and a certain short duration of increased flow could be programmed into the operation to dislodge particles more regularly. 3 Experimental procedure 3.1 CO2 isotherm for zeolite 13X The CO2 adsorption isotherms of 3D-printed zeolite 13X monolith were measured at 25, 50, and 75 °C using a volumetric gas analyzer, Micromeritics 3Flex. Prior to the measurements, the sample was degassed at 250 °C for 12 h on a Micromeritics PreVac to remove any pre-adsorbed gases, moisture and other impurities, followed by cooling down the sample tube to the adsorption temperature. 3.2 Breakthrough experiments To assess the dynamic adsorption performance of the 3D-printed zeolite monolith, breakthrough experiments were carried out at 25 °C and 1 bar. The schematic of the setup is provided elsewhere [44]. About 0.75 g of the sample was placed in the fixed bed and degassed at 400 °C to drive-off the pre-adsorbed gases and moisture under N2 with a flow rate of 60 mL/min. Then, the system was cooled down to 25 °C and the inlet gas was switched to a mixture of 0.5% CO2 and 99.5 % N2 to start the measurements. The outlet CO2 concentration was recorded by a mass spectrometer (BELMass, Japan). The breakthrough experiments were used to estimate the mass transfer rates for the 3D-printed zeolite monoliths. 4 Results and discussion 4.1 Parameter estimation 4.1.1 CO2 isotherm The data points obtained experimentally (Section 3) were fitted using the lsqnonlin solver in MATLAB for nonlinear curve fitting. The isotherm parameters were fitted to the Henry-Langmuir isotherm model, eq. (12). (12) Q C O 2 eq = q sat b 1 p C O 2 1 + ( b 1 p C O 2 ) + b 2 p C O 2 where, Qeq CO2 is the equilibrium concentration of CO2 at the adsorbent surface, q sat is the saturation capacity of the adsorbent, pCO2 is obtained from CO2 concentration inside the monolith (CCO2,M ) and b1 and b2 are isotherm parameters listed in Table 2 . Fig. 6 shows the model fitting of the isotherm with the experimental data at 25, 50 and 75 °C, where pCO2 is the partial pressure of CO2 in the gas phase. The figure shows good agreement between the experimental data and the fitted model. 4.1.2 Mass transfer rate The mass transfer coefficient for zeolite 13X monolith (KM ) is estimated by fitting the experimental data of fixed bed experiments. Fig. 7 shows the model fitting with the experimental data. The model parameters such as air inlet velocity (vair ) and monolith bed length (LM ) are kept the same as the experimental set up. It can be seen from the figure that fitting obtained with mass transfer coefficient KM at 0.016 s−1 shows good agreement with the experimental data points. Hence, this value is chosen for modeling the the zeolite 13X monolith. On the other hand, mass transfer coefficient for silica gel in the packed bed dehumidification units, KD , is assumed to be 0.0057 s−1 [37]. 4.1.3 Concentration dynamics The air composition control system is designed to maintain a specific air quality inside the room. The minimum accepted oxygen level is 19.5%. The CO2 level is maintained below 5000 ppm in order to reduce the chances of headaches and nausea, which may reduce work efficiency. The humidity level is kept in the range of 30 \u2013 60 %. The bounds provided are consistent with ASHRAE standards [17]. The electricity price is assumed to be constant throughout the day except during 2 \u2013 7 pm during which it is assumed to be elevated [45]. To simulate the concentration profiles of the multi component system, we have used systems design parameters provided in Table 3 with systems design provided in Section 2.1. A room size of 5 × 5 m2 with the ceiling height of 2.5 m is chosen as a sample room which has air composition control system installed to maintain the air quality. It is assumed that 5 people occupy the room during regular office hours, 9 AM \u2013 5 PM. The dimension of monolith is determined based on the room dimensions, number of people and zeolite 13X adsorption properties, such that CO2 concentration inside the room is to always remain below 5000 ppm. The size of dehumidifiers is determined such that it maintain the humidity level inside the room between 30 and 60% during an entire day of operation of air composition control system. Table 4 lists the operating parameters used for the system. As described earlier, the ventilation rate (V.R.) required with air composition control system in operation is termed as Reduced V.R and the ventilation rate required during no human present in the room is termed as No-Occupancy V.R. For comparison purposes, the ventilation rate required (Normal V.R.) without air composition control system is calculated to be around 14x10-4 m3/s-person to maintain CO2, O2 and H2O within desired levels. The monolith operating parameters are chosen such that CO2 level inside the room always remains below 5000 ppm, while the amount of zeolite 13X adsorbent in the bed is utilized effectively for CO2 removal. Fig. 8 shows the CO2 concentration inside room (Fig. 8 a) and at monolith exit (Fig. 8 b) on a 24-hr. time basis. The CO2 concentration inside the room (shown in Fig. 8 a) increases during 9 AM \u2013 5 PM due to respiration by the people present inside the room. However, as seen from the figure, there are periodic drops in the CO2 concentration. This is because the air composition control system operates during this time which keeps removing CO2 at cyclic intervals by the zeolite 13X monoliths as seen from Fig. 8 b. Fig. 8 a shows slow reduction in CO2 concentration during 5 \u2013 7 PM. The reduction in CO2 level is because it is assumed there is no human occupancy after 5 PM and a constant ventilation rate has been maintained during that time frame (refer to Fig. 5). However, the reduction is not rapid since the air composition control system does not operate from 5 − 7 PM. This is done to save the electricity cost which is usually higher during this time frame [45]. The influence of the idle air composition control system for 5 \u2013 7 PM can also be seen in Fig. 8 b, which shows no swing in CO2 concentration. As can be seen from Fig. 8 a, the CO2 concentration drops rapidly after 7 PM till it reaches the initial level at around 3 AM. This is because, from 7 PM onwards, the air composition control system is switched on again and it starts to operate till the CO2 concentration inside the room stabilizes at the lower bound at around 3 AM. The periodic adsorption and desorption of CO2 concentration at the monolith exit during this time frame can be seen in Fig. 8 b. Fig. 8 a and b show that the CO2 concentration during 3 \u2013 9 AM is at a plateau. After 3 AM, the air composition control system is switched off since there is no need for further reduction in the room CO2 concentration. The minimal change in CO2 concentration during this time frame is due to ventilation (No Occupancy V.R.) maintained at a constant rate (Table 4). Fig. 9 shows the concentration of CO2, O2 and H2O when the air composition control system remains operative for a week. It can be seen from the figure that the CO2 concentration remains below 5000 ppm, and humidity level swings between 40 and 50% during the entire duration of the operation of the air composition control system. It can also be seen from the figure that the oxygen level initially drops and then reaches equilibrium within 3 days, after which it swings in the range of 19.5 \u2013 20.4 %. This shows that the multi-bed, multi-component system is able to maintain the air concentrations within the desired ranges. 4.2 Performance evaluation 4.2.1 Energy To compute the energy (and cost) of the air composition control system in a typical commercial building, we have assumed a building with five floors occupying a ground area of 250 m2 (10 rooms on each floor) with an average space allocation of 5 m2 per person. We have utilized the procedures explained in section 2.3.1 to arrive at the results presented in this section. We consider four different cases to analyze how the ventilation and air composition control system influences the CO2 concentration inside the room: a) no ventilation and no air composition control system, b) normal V.R. and no air composition control system, c) reduced V.R. with an air composition control system, and d) reduced V.R. without air composition control system. For all the four cases, the indoor air temperature and oxygen concentration ranges are kept the same for comparison. For the analysis of these cases, we assumed the human occupancy inside the room for 14 h to better visualize steady state for some of the cases. The dynamics of the CO2 profile from 9 AM to 5 PM is illustrated in Fig. 10 for the four cases mentioned above. It can be seen from the figure that CO2 concentration can be maintained within 5000 ppm only in case b and c. These two cases are explained in detail along with their energy requirements below: 1) Case b (Conventional ventilation system): The air quality inside the room is maintained only by external ventilation. The external air flow rate is maintained such that the CO2, O2 and humidity level remain within the acceptable limits [17]. The energy consumption is due to conditioning the external air to room condition. 2) Case c (Air composition control system): This case is same as the operating strategy explained in Fig. 5. The air quality inside the room is maintained by air composition control system and reduced V.R. The energy consumption is due to conditioning of external air and energy required by the blowers to cycle the air inside the room through dehumidification and monolithic units. Fig. 11 shows the total energy usage per year (assuming 24-hour energy consumption each day) comparison of the case b (conventional ventilation system) and case c (air composition control system). It can be seen from the figure that for air composition control system, the energy usage due to regeneration is negligible compared to the energy usage by blowers and air conditioning units. It can also be seen from the figure that the energy usage with air composition control system reduces the energy requirement by 55% as compared to the conventional ventilation system. This is because air composition control system requires reduced ventilation rate compared to conventional ventilation system. This results in lower energy consumption to condition the external air. We have compared the energy usage of case b (conventional ventilation system) and case c (air composition control system) in summer as well as winter conditions on an hourly basis as shown in Fig. 12 . It can be seen from the figure that when people are inside the room (9 AM \u2013 5 PM), the air composition control system requires only a quarter of the power consumption as compared to the conventional ventilation system. This is due to lower external ventilation rate required in air composition control system as compared to the conventional ventilation system. We observe seasonal differences and daily dynamics in Fig. 12. For both systems, the summer energy usage is higher than winter because of the additional humidification load incurred for conditioning external air during summer. It can be seen in the figure that the hourly energy usage during summer is around twice than that during winter. It can also be seen from the figure that the energy usage for both systems is higher during office hours (9 AM \u2013 5 PM) compared to non-office hours (after 5 PM). This is because the external ventilation rate, which requires more energy, is substantially higher during office hours (reduced V.R.) compared to non-office hours (No Occupancy V.R.) as can be seen in Table 4. Hence higher energy is required to condition the external air during office hours. The energy consumption of capturing unit mass of CO2 through air composition control system is provided in Table 5 . As discussed in section 2.3.1, energy requirement for air conditioners is for operating the HVAC unit, for blowers is for operating the CO2 removal unit and for regeneration is for regenerating the saturated dehumidification unit. A scale up factor of 3.14 [46] have been used to convert the electrical energy to primary energy. This allows comparison of systems using different forms of energy on a common basis and to compare them with the energy available when combusting carbon. It can be seen from the table that the total energy consumption is 1.28 MJ per mole of CO2 removed. This is more than the energy associated with heat of combustion that generated the CO2 (0.45 MJ/mole). However, it should be noted that the primary objective of the air composition control process is not to capture CO2, but to reduce the energy burden of air conditioning system by reducing the external ventilation. CO2 capture by the air composition control system is an auxiliary benefit if the CO2 removed can be utilized, stored, or integrated with other processes inside a commercial building, labs and research facilities. However, for effective capture, the concentration swing process used to desorb the CO2 would need to be replaced by a regeneration process that avoids diluting the CO2 with ambient air. This would consume more energy and this strategy is not considered within the scope of this study. 4.2.2 Cost In this section we discuss the cost associated with the air composition control and the HVAC system. The detailed equations along with underlying assumptions are discussed in section 2.3.2. The components which add up to the overall cost are: \u2022 Monolith capital cost, \u2022 Packed bed capital cost, \u2022 Blower capital cost, \u2022 Air conditioner operating cost, \u2022 Blower operating cost, and \u2022 Regeneration operating cost. Fig. 13 shows the distribution of these cost components in $/year. It can be seen from the figure that the operating cost (OPEX) for the air conditioner (A/ C) is the key cost component of the air composition control system. This is because of high electricity consumption to condition the ventilated air. The operating strategy of the system (Section 2.1.4) is designed assuming that the electricity price remains constant throughout the day. However, the electricity price is usually higher (in the U.S.) during 2 \u2013 7 pm [45]. We have analyzed three different operating strategies in order to factor flexible electricity price in the cost estimates. These operating strategies (Fig. 14 ) are discussed below: 1. The air composition control system operates from 9 AM \u2013 5 PM with reduced V.R., and is switched off from 5 to 7 PM. It is switched on again with no-occupancy V.R. after 7 PM. This strategy is same as the described in section 2.1.4 earlier in this paper. 2. During office hours, the air composition control system operates from 9 AM \u2013 2 PM with reduced V.R. From 2 to 7 PM, the system is switched off and the air quality inside the room is maintained by normal V.R. only. The system is switched on after 7 PM with no-occupancy V.R. 3. During the office hours, the air composition control system is operative from 9 AM- 5 PM with reduced V.R., except for an interim period (between 2 and 5 pm) such that the air quality is maintained within the limits without the need for increase in external ventilation. This is done to reduce the effect of increased electricity price without incurring extra cost of conditioning external air at an increased ventilation rate. The modeling results indicate a 20-minute window, during which the system can be switched off with this strategy. The system is then switched off from 5 to 7 PM and switched on again after 7 PM with no-occupancy V.R. Similar to strategy 3, another approach would be to have a bigger air composition control system that can further increase the 20-minute window discussed in this case. This would require tuning of model parameters such that the extra capital cost does not outweigh the capital savings. Exploration of this strategy is beyond the scope of this paper. Fig. 15 provides the operating cost ($/yr) of the above cases and compare it with the conventional ventilation system. It can be seen from the table that operating cost for the conventional ventilation system is higher than the air composition control system in all of the three operating strategies. This is because the cost to condition the external air is higher for conventional ventilation system compared to the air composition control system. It can be seen from Fig. 15 that the strategy 2 has the highest operating cost. This is due to the increase in external ventilation rate from 2 to 7 PM which is needed to remove excess CO2 since air composition control system is off during this time. This results in higher consumption of electricity to condition the excess ventilated air. It is also evident from Fig. 15 that strategy 1 and 3 have the same economics. This signifies that even though the monolith and packed bed are switched off for 20 min (between 2 and 7 pm) in strategy 3, it does not lower the operating cost. This is because the power consumption for the blowers is relatively small as compared to air conditioners (Fig. 11). Hence switching off the air composition control system for 20 min does not have substantial effect on the overall cost. Hence our proposed operating strategy 1 is superior or similar in cost consideration as compared to other strategies that we have analyzed. Another metric to quantify and assess the economics of the air composition control system is to evaluate the cost in terms of the unit mass of CO2 removed from the air. Table 6 shows the cost contribution of the components involved in removal of CO2. The total cost of CO2 removal from the enclosed environment is $248 per tCO2 removed. It can be seen from the table that the operating cost (OPEX) of the air conditioner is the leading cost contributors. The total cost of CO2 removal can be further reduced by optimizing the cycle time and synthesizing the monoliths with a new adsorbent that has a higher CO2 adsorption capacity. Table 7 shows Internal rate of return (IRR) calculation for the air composition control calculation. The initial investment for monoliths, packed beds and blowers for a single room are calculated using equations provided in section 2.3.2. The future cash flow is assumed to be the saved electricity for the air composition control system as compared to the conventional ventilation system. The IRR is found to be around 15%. 4.2.3 Carbon footprint It is important to assess the impact of the air composition control system on the environment because of the energy consumption and CO2 emissions and compare its performance with the conventional ventilation system. To make realistic estimates, we assume an office inventory of 45 million m2 which is roughly the same size as net office space in New York City [36], assuming it consists of colelction of individual rooms with systems design provided in Table 3. We also assume an average of five-story building which results in 1 MtCO2 removal by the air composition control system (case b, section 4.3.1) per year. Keeping the statistics same for the conventional ventilation system (case c, section 4.3.1), we compare the CO2 emissions in terms of CO2 equivalent for both systems. Table 8 lists the emission data for the two systems based on the source of electricity generation. We have used the operating strategy mentioned in Section 2.1.4 to arrive at emission estimates. We have listed five sources of electricity generation: solar, wind, natural gas (NG), coal and US grid along with their life cycle greenhouse gas emissions in grams of CO2 equivalent per kWh. It can be seen from the table that air composition control and conventional ventilation system have around 15 times lower emissions when the electricity generation source is solar and around 50 times lower emissions when the source is wind as compared to coal. This is because of renewable nature of the solar and wind. It can also be seen that the mitigated CO2 emission by replacing conventional ventilation system with the proposed air composition control system is around 1.66 MtCO2e/yr when the U.S. grid is used as electricity generation source. It can also be seen from Table 8 that by using the air composition control system, the total Mt CO2 emitted per year decreases by about 55% as compared to the conventional ventilation system irrespective of the electricity generation source used. If we analyze the emissions from the air composition control and conventional ventilation system for electricity generated from US grid source, the difference in emissions from both the systems is equivalent to 57 million incandescent lamps switched to LEDs, or 3.5 million barrels of oil consumed [47]. If we analyze the emissions from a single building with five floors and occupying 250 sq. m of ground space, the emissions for air composition control and conventional ventilation system are 7 and 15 tCO2e/yr. respectively. The difference in their emissions provide the same environmental benefit as replacing 300 incandescent bulbs to LEDs. 4.2.4 Sensitivity analysis The analysis performed in the previous sections assume that all the parameters are known. However, the assumption regarding fixed parameters may not hold true in real life situations, because of inherent uncertainty with certain model parameters. For example, in estimating the CO2 energy requirements and footprint of a building, it is assumed that the total space is a collection of sample rooms of fixed size occupied with fixed number of people in each room. The assumption that a building can be divided into rooms of fixed equal size is a simplification to enable modeling. Similarly, the number of people occupying the room may not be constant during different time of a day. To quantify such uncertainties, it is important to perform sensitivity analysis of these input parameters and analyse their impact on the model outputs. We have performed sensitivity analysis on the number of people inside the room to analyze its impact on model output. The number of people inside the room is varied between 3 and 6 people (a resulting spatial density between 3 to 17 m2 per person) from the base case of 5 people. Non integer values of people are possible since it represents average number of people occupying the room during the entire day. Fig. 16 a shows the effect of people density on CO2 concentration dynamics inside the room. The system is analyzed during office hours (9 AM \u2013 5 PM). It can be seen from the figure that the peak CO2 concentration inside the room increases with an increase in the density of people. This is because, keeping other parameters fixed, an increase in the people density increases the respiration dynamics inside the room. Hence the peak CO2 concentration increases since the monolithic system can remove only a fixed amount of CO2. We have also performed sensitivity analysis on the room size, varying it from 4 × 4 × 2.3 (∼37) m3 to 6 × 6 × 2.6 (∼128) m3. Fig. 16b shows the effect of room volume on CO2 concentration dynamics inside the room. It can be seen from the figure that time to reach the peak concentration increases with increase in room volume. The room with the lowest volume reaches the peak concentration within 8 h while the room with the highest volume has still not reached the peak concentration yet. From Fig. 8 a presented earlier in this paper, it should be noted that maximum CO2 concentration reached inside the room is 4000 ppm. It ranges from 800 ppm to 4000 ppm during the working hours (9 AM \u2013 5 PM). The air composition control system is modeled under the assumption that all the occupants stay inside the room 100% of the time during the working hours. In many scenarios, the occupancy could be lower, which would reduce the value of the control system. In addition, the average human CO2 generation rate could be less than the one used in our model (Table 1). Hence, the peak CO2 concentration reached can be lower than 4000 ppm. However, if the air composition control system needs to be recalibrated for a higher human occupancy and higher peak CO2 concentration reached inside the room, it can be achieved at the design stage by using a larger monolith size, and during operation by using a longer cycle time and/or faster monolith inlet air flow rate to remove higher levels of CO2 per cycle. Fig. 17 shows the variation in total cost with respect to total cycle time and monolith size (relative to base case presented in Table 3). It can be seen from both the figure that the increase in total cost of air composition control system is proportional to the total cycle time as well as monolith size. However, in both cases the total cost is below the cost incurred by conventional ventilation system, if the cycle time is less than 1500 s or monolith size is increased to factor of 3.5. For both the cases (cycle time and monolith size), the total energy consumption is unaffected since change in the cycle time and monolith size only affects the capital cost and not the operating cost of the air composition control system. Fig. 18 shows the variation of cost and energy consumption of air composition control system with change in monolith inlet air velocity. It can be seen from the figure that the total cost and energy consumption increases with the increase in inlet air velocity. This is because with the increase the volumetric flow rate, energy consumption by blowers increases, thereby increasing the monolith operating cost. It can be also seen from the figure that the cost of the air composition control system remains below that of conventional ventilation system if the air inlet velocity is less than 2.5 m/s. Hence for future work, if the system needs to be further tuned for higher occupancy or lower peak CO2 concentration inside the room, a combination of total cycle time, monolith size and air inlet velocity needs to be tuned to design such a system. 5 Summary and conclusions The paper presents a multi component multi bed system keeping realistic constraints on CO2, O2 and humidity level inside enclosed environment. It is found that the energy and cost requirement of the air composition control system is dominated by the electricity consumption by the air conditioners. On comparison of the air composition control system with the conventional ventilation system, it is found that installation of the system leads to 55% reduction in energy usage as compared to the conventional ventilation system. It is also concluded that power consumption during summer is higher than that during winter, and the power consumption by the air composition control system is around one-fourth of the conventional ventilation system during the office hours. Cost requirements of the air composition control system are lower than conventional ventilation system. Using a better adsorbent with a higher CO2 equilibrium capacity would further bring down the cost and energy requirement of the system. Another strategy to cut down the cost is to use a water stable CO2 adsorbent, which would allow elimination of the dehumidification unit and potentially combining the two beds and reducing capital costs, but the independent control of CO2 and water becomes more difficult. As a future work, natural ventilation in buildings during shoulder seasons can be integrated to further reduce the cost and energy requirements of the proposed system. The strategy proposed in this paper discards the CO2 removed back into the atmosphere because the proposed strategy in this paper removes CO2 by concentration swing using outside air which results in a low concentration of CO2 being generated. This challenge can be further overcome with a vacuum and temperature swing to generate nearly pure CO2, which can be captured for storage and utilization. Techno-economic analysis for CO2 capture by the proposed system can be a future scope of research in this area. Finally, this paper presents a scale up study by analyzing the carbon footprint of total office inventory of New York City and compared the emissions from the air composition control system with the conventional ventilation system. It is found that for an office space comparable to New York City, total annual savings in emissions by using the system is equivalent to replacing 57 million incandescent lamps by LEDs, or reducing oil consumption by 3.5 million barrels per year. As a future work, energy and cost analysis can be extended to different building types in different climate zones.

        "dc:description": "Rapid growth in global energy consumption has raised concern on the environmental impacts such as ozone layer depletion and climate change. Enclosed space, such as commercial buildings, accounts for about 40% of global energy consumption and the demand is constantly increasing due to increasing population, urbanization, and economic development. The energy demands in the building sector calls for strategic measures to develop energy efficient technologies. This paper presents a strategy to decrease energy demands inside buildings by proposing a ventilation system which regulates the enclosed air quality resulting in reduced air conditioning. The system consists of multiple adsorption beds with zeolite 13X monoliths for CO2 removal, and silica gel for humidity control, inside the enclosed space. The air conditioning system results in decrease in energy requirement and improvement in economics by 55% as compared with conventional ventilation system. The model is scaled up to the size comparable with total office inventory of New York City, and the reduction in carbon emissions by introducing the air composition control system for New York City is equivalent to replacing 57 million incandescent light bulbs by LEDs. This paper concludes that the air conditioning system proposed in this study results in the improvement in performance as compared to a conventional ventilation system and could reduce energy consumption inside commercial buildings.",
