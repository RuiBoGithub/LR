This paper proposes a novel hierarchical optimization framework that couples the balancing problem of a community network with building energy management (BEM) to form an integrated model capable of capturing potential joint-flexibilities of connected buildings while co-optimizing the operation schedules of community-operated assets. The proposed framework comprises a community-level power flow-based model to solve the energy procurement problem of the community and a building-level physics-aware simulation model to estimate a set of day-ahead aggregate load scenarios with potential joint-flexibilities. At the building-level, a least-cost multi-objective optimization provides a sequence of optimal temperature setpoints for all thermal zones that is fed into an accurate Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) to estimate heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) load trajectories while considering human comfort, occupancy patterns, building thermal response, and intraday electricity prices. The community-level model co-optimizes day-ahead schedules of shared distributed energy resources (DERs) and electric vehicle (EV) chargings while directing the building cluster to adapt the joint-flexibilities to balance the community network under different operation conditions. Finally, a test building cluster located in Qatar University is investigated through several case studies. The simulation results reveal the model\u2019s practicality in fully capturing the joint-flexibilities of the building cluster for an adaptable community operation which cuts the operation cost by 21.04%.

address resiliency, reliability, and emissions problems resulting in the push to a more decentralized, decarbonized, and democratizing modern grid that is gaining momentum with notable real-world applications such as microgrid deployments in several U.S. states, India, and Africa [1]. The gradual transformation of the grid is largely due to the adoption of distributed energy resources (DERs) and electric vehicles (EV) that inject more variability into the distribution network. However, this transition requires new solutions to not only deal with the arising operational challenges but also to maximize potential benefits from the available demand-side flexibilities in an interactive community network [2]. Hence, the balancing problem of the community grid and building energy management (BEM) should be solved in tandem to create optimal adaptable scheduling strategies that consider both community-level factors such as shared DERs and power flow limits [3], and building-level factors, e.g., demand balance with potential load flexibilities [4]. In this context, this paper aims at coupling these problems in a smart building community operation framework involving various onsite DERs and demand flexibilities to address sustainability while satisfying community network constraints. From the building-level perspective, BEM still mainly refers to heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) operation\u2014it is reiterated in the literature that HVAC is the largest single source of electricity consumption in non-industrial settings [5]. In 2019, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) stated that the commercial and residential sectors accounted for 39% of total U.S. energy consumption, and over 30% of that is attributed to HVAC [6]. This fact, combined with pressure to lessen environmental impact, has resulted in a great deal of research on reducing building energy consumption. As laid out by Drgoňa et al. in [7], there are almost two decades of research focused on optimal control strategies that utilize predictive models to anticipate building thermal behavior. In [8], a model predictive control (MPC) system with adaptive machine-learning-based building models is proposed for building automation and control where a multi-objective function is employed to optimize both energy efficiency and indoor thermal comfort. The authors in [8] construct and train an initial artificial neural network (ANN)-based building model using the historical building operation data, which is then used to formulate an initial MPC controller to perform real-time control of the test building for generating a new set of online building operation data. Feeding this new data set to the database, the ANN-based building model is adapted, which leads to a new MPC controller that performs real-time control during the next model adaption cycle. The proposed MPC system with an adaptive ML-based building model, which aims at minimizing the cooling energy consumed by Air Conditioning and Mechanical Ventilation systems, is implemented in two single-zone testbeds, an office room and a lecture theater, and solved using a hybrid optimization approach combining the global and gradient-based optimization methods. There are also several cost-saving approaches to the optimal building control problem, such as peak shaving, load shifting, and demand-side management [9]. For instance, the application of a thermal energy storage system coupled with heat pumps in demand-side management of an industrial building is investigated in [10], where shifting cooling energy demand to weekend daytime is explored to recover excess solar power generation or to off-peak hours to get benefit from lower electricity prices. TRNSYS simulation software is employed by the authors in [10] to model the building and the heating/cooling system, where the operation of thermal energy storage during the working week is evaluated by varying the minimum temperature set-point. The dynamic simulation is deployed to analyze the electric energy use breakdown of the system and identify the best operative configuration. A demand-side management strategy to minimize HVAC energy consumption using zone occupancy patterns and thermal mapping to avoid arbitrarily cooling unoccupied zones is proposed in [11]. The proposed control model aims at optimizing cooling system scheduling on the basis of occupancy patterns, price signal from utilities and human comfort and productivity, while zone thermal behavior is taken into account. The flexibility potential of building thermal storage and battery energy storage is investigated in [12], where a linear autoregressive model with exogenous inputs (ARX) is proposed to forecast the building dynamic cooling load. A mixed-integer linear programming model is then developed by the authors in [12] to minimize the operation costs by optimizing the dispatch of building energy systems while considering the peak\u2013valley difference of the feeder power. A factory building located in Huizhou, China, is implemented as the test case to assess the performance of the proposed model. Carlucci et al. present a literature review of models developed for occupant behavior in [13], where the Markov Chain processes are one of the common data-driven models which provide a systematic way to evaluate human-building interactions. Aside from this, multiple studies address the thermal response modeling at the building-level, ranging from the physics-based resistance-capacitance (RC) thermal circuit analogy (white-box) to statistical models that learn building dynamics from measured data without making any prior assumptions (black-box) [7]. From the community-level perspective, new saving opportunities arise as energy infrastructure changes to a more distributed network with increased node interoperability and DER integration [14]. In the modern energy sector, solar power is reaching grid parity [15], and retail energy markets are emerging [16], leading the next generation of energy management controllers to use a framework that accounts for buildings as part of an interactive power network constituting a smart community with shared DERs and load flexibilities. Research into building cluster optimal control has increased alongside popularizing concepts such as microgrids, smart buildings, and connected communities. In 2021, the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewables announced a $65 million funding commitment for research into \u201cConnected Communities\u201d [17]. Vigna et al. provide a comprehensive overview of building cluster operational control frameworks and verify the economic viability of cluster-scale interactive building control with aggregate demand flexibility [18]. The authors adopt the concept of \u201cEnergy Flexible Building\u201d from IEA EBC Annex 67, that is defined as a building able to manage its demand and generation in accordance with local climate conditions, user needs and grid requirements. Some auxiliary concepts adopted from the literature are also identified and reviewed by the authors in [18] to describe the synergy of energy-efficient buildings and renewable energy utilization at an aggregated level, including smart building cluster, zero energy neighborhood with smart interaction between buildings and grid, micro energy hub, virtual power plant as a strategy for aggregating heterogeneous DERs, collaborative consumption, and local energy community concept introduced by the European Commission. A transactive energy-based distributed energy management system is developed in [19] for a community microgrid, where the customers are enabled to adjust their HVAC systems based on their level of comfort and the cost of electricity. In the proposed distributed optimization model in [19], thermal dynamic characteristics of houses are integrated into the distributed energy management system for community microgrid enabling intelligent control of the HVAC system with autonomy and privacy for customers. In [20], Najafi et al. realize a significant decrease in operational costs through the effects of power exchange in connected smart apartments that use a shared energy management system, while in [21] Nakabi et al. demonstrate a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method for energy management in a microgrid with flexible demand. The proposed mixed-integer linear programming model in [20] aims at minimizing the total operation cost of the apartment buildings by scheduling and prioritizing performance of smart appliances in the presence of DERs including combined heat and power (CHP) generator, and battery and thermal storage systems. On the other hand, the DRL proposed in [21], which is mainly focused on deep Q-learning algorithm, combines direct control of a thermostatically controlled loads cluster and indirect control of price-responsive loads through price-based demand response program given exogenous conditions on demand, external network prices and wind energy resources. In addition, the authors in [22] propose a three-step internal trading strategy for optimal energy sharing among building microgrids to minimize the operation cost of the entire system. In the three-step trading strategy in [22], barter trading is performed in the first step to exchange energies between building microgrids, where building microgrids with insufficient electricity and excess heat can be paired with buildings with excess electricity and insufficient heat to exchange their energies. The remaining excess energy is sold to the other building microgrids with energy inadequacy in the second step. Finally, in the third step, building microgrids with lower generation cost than the external system increase their power generation, if capable, and trade with other building microgrids. Moreover, various hierarchical control frameworks for microgrids and microgrid clusters are explored in [23], where the authors provide multiagent system (MAS) control strategies to show the benefits of MAS analysis for balancing the grid, keeping voltage and frequency stable, and achieving economically coordinated operation. The technical literature, however, lacks an integrated framework that aids community operators in capturing the joint-flexibilities of the connected buildings in a dynamic network where the power flow constraints of the distribution network are incorporated into a cooperative energy management strategy to enhance the adaptability of the community\u2019s operation. Consequently, coordinated building control may unlock cost savings potential and lead to effective solutions for sustainable smart cities and communities. This paper investigates a tiered two-level optimal day-ahead scheduling strategy suited for a smart building community with a set of shared-DERs and potential joint-flexibilities to be rescheduled under different operation conditions. In the proposed hierarchical optimization framework, the building-level optimization model, which aims at minimizing the electricity procurement cost of an individual building, is designed to optimize zonal temperature setpoints in response to the day-ahead weather conditions, occupancy, and electricity price estimations while penalizing deviations from the given comfort level. The building cluster behavior is simulated using EnergyPlus software [24] to model the buildings\u2019 thermal behavior and energy consumption concerning the HVAC, equipment/plug loads, and lighting system. The simulations are all conducted with actual buildings\u2019 floor plans, which are used to model the building cluster geometry for providing physical attributes of the cluster and the buildings\u2019 specs and schedules, including the HVAC, lighting, equipment/plug loads, and occupancy features. The efficacy of the proposed methodology depends on the quality and reliability of the input parameters, that are all measurable/tractable by building inspections and managements, particularly occupancy and lighting schedules, which are deterministic schedules in our case. The EnergyPlus simulation can model the electricity consumption of building end-uses for any preferred time intervals greater than one minute. The simulations are afterward deployed to train day-ahead predictive models concerning building indoor environment variations\u2014thermal mapping\u2014and electricity demand, which eventually constitute the outputs of our proposed building-level optimization model. To model the zonal thermal response of each building, which enables actual physical attributes in decision-making, a hybrid approach is used where multiple multivariate linear regression analysis is performed on a large amount of time-series data generated by the EnergyPlus simulations. Thus, the first objective is to construct two primary multivariate linear regression models to estimate both zonal thermal capacity in increasing/decreasing indoor temperature and buildings\u2019 HVAC electricity consumption where a distributed zonal control strategy is incorporated given weather conditions. In this framework, linearized predictive models allow for creating quadratic optimization models and ensuring the optimization model\u2019s convexity and convergence. The I/O and data exchange are managed by a co-simulation of MATLAB and EnergyPlus through Lawrence Berkeley Labs Building Control Virtual Testbed (BCVTB), using Berkeley sockets [25]. MATLAB generates temperature setpoints and stores the data while communicating with EnergyPlus simulation through BCVTB. These models are trained on the full scope of the community\u2019s ambient disturbance regimes to provide reliable linear relationships between zonal indoor air temperature and HVAC load while accounting for weather data. The set of optimal temperature setpoints is then fed to an accurate Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) to estimate each building\u2019s HVAC load. Further, the estimated HVAC load is sent to an aggregator for summing it up with the building\u2019s lighting and equipment/plug loads to estimate the total energy consumption of each building within the community, which is then sent to the community-level optimization model. The community-level optimization model aggregates various consumption scenarios across all buildings and creates an operation schedule by co-simulation of MATLAB and GAMS while minimizing the total operation cost of the community under different operation conditions. Fig. 1 illustrates the proposed two-level optimization framework. Each building\u2019s controller adapts the internal flexibilities by thermal mapping and flexible load rescheduling to follow a specific demand profile in response to control signal received from the community\u2019s master controller given the community operation condition to direct aggregate demand in response to electricity price signals and available onsite shared-DERs and potential community-level demand flexibilities. To reveal the practicality of the proposed two-level optimization framework, a test case consists of four verified EnergyPlus building models which represent a real connected building community at Qatar University is implemented through various case studies. All of the building controllers are connected to the master controller enabling constant communication within the campus and with the upstream grid for electricity pricing and contingencies. We propose a novel yet sensible objectives into a community-level and building-level hierarchy\u2014the hierarchical framework addresses community and building considerations in separate optimization problems to avoid undue runtimes, complexity, concavity, etc. This methodology is developed to create a day-ahead scheduling plan for the operation of connected buildings within a community with potential joint-flexibilities stemming from zonal thermal mapping and building- and community-level demand flexibilities. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: The day-ahead building-level load estimation model is presented in Section 2, where the zonal setpoint optimization and HVAC load models are elaborated. Section 3 represents the proposed community-level day-ahead asset and flexibility scheduling model where the coupled power flow and flexibility models are developed. Case studies and numerical results are presented in Section 4. Finally, the conclusions are drawn and discussed in Section 5. 1.1 Notation Unless otherwise stated, boldface lowercase and uppercase letters represent vectors and matrices; x ̲ and x ¯ denote minimum and maximum limits on decision variable x ; y ̂ represents the estimation of parameter y ; w ∗ shows the optimal value of parameter/variable w ; A T indicates matrix A transpose; and ≤ , =, and ≥ denote element-wise operations. T represents the scheduling horizon divided to T same-length time intervals with the τ th interval to be T τ ≔ t τ − 1 , t τ with the length Δ t ≔ t τ − t τ − 1 such that T = ⋃ τ = 1 T T τ holds. 2 The proposed building-level day-ahead load estimation model 2.1 Day-ahead zonal setpoint optimization model The objective of the day-ahead planning is to minimize the cost of electricity consumption by adjusting the zonal temperature setpoints while penalizing temperature deviations from a comfort level considering the system\u2019s actual thermal capacity estimation. This means that the proposed day-ahead optimization model yields a sequence of optimal zonal temperature setpoints within the HVAC system\u2019s capacity. For instance, if the current indoor temperature is stable at 25 °C given the system conditions, the HVAC system can reduce the temperature by 2 °C in the next 15 min interval; thereby, zonal temperature setpoints lower than 23 °C are infeasible based on the physics of the system. Accordingly, the problem is modeled as a constrained quadratic programming problem for each building as: (1) (2) (3) where θ τ is a vector of zonal temperature setpoints at time interval τ with N thermal zones as θ τ = θ 1 τ , θ 2 τ , \u2026 , θ N τ T ; θ CMFT is a constant vector of ideal comfort level temperature setpoints and η is a penalty for deviation from comfort level; λ τ is the average electricity price during time interval τ ; E ̂ : R N ↦ R is a function that estimates the electricity consumption of HVAC system within time interval τ , which is modeled later in this section; θ ̂ τ − 1 DWN and θ ̂ τ − 1 UP are the minimum and maximum thermal capacity in time interval τ − 1 , respectively; θ ̲ and θ ¯ are respectively the minimum and maximum acceptable indoor temperatures; and 1 N is an N-dimensional vector of ones. Furthermore, in order to consider the zonal occupancy in the lower-level day-ahead optimization model, we assumed that θ τ is decomposed as θ τ ≔ θ τ UOC , θ τ OC T such that θ τ UOC ≔ θ 1 τ , \u2026 , θ N U τ T and θ τ OC ≔ θ ( N U + 1 ) τ , \u2026 , θ N τ T based on the estimated zonal occupancies over ∀ τ ∈ T . Accordingly, an additional set of equality constraints associated with unoccupied zones within time interval τ are incorporated to adjust the optimization problem presented in (1)\u2013(3) based on a predefined temperature setback, denoted by θ SBK , which is formulated as: (4) θ τ UOC = θ SBK 1 N U ∀ τ where θ ̲ ≤ θ SBK ≤ θ ¯ holds. It should be noted that E ̂ ( θ τ ) in the objective function (1) is initially modeled to determine the impacts of zonal temperature setpoint changes on total HVAC consumption. Later in this section, we estimate the HVAC load by employing GBM, which yields more accurate results than our initial estimation, where externalities, such as weather conditions, are also considered. Our developed zonal thermal capacity models for θ ̂ τ − 1 DWN , θ ̂ τ − 1 UP , and the initial HVAC load model E ̂ ( θ τ ) are presented next. 2.2 Zonal thermal capacity model A linear regression model is constructed here in this section to initially estimate the zonal thermal capacity. Let us assume Δ θ τ to be the vector of zonal temperature variations during the next time interval as a result of the operation of the HVAC system given the current state of the system. The main factors influencing the zonal temperature variation within time interval τ are considered to be the vector of zonal temperatures during τ − 1 , denoted by θ τ − 1 , outdoor temperature and relative humidity during τ − 1 , denoted by θ τ − 1 OUT and H τ − 1 OUT respectively, solar irradiance in τ − 1 , R τ − 1 , an ordinal categorical variable based on time interval of the day, e.g. on an hourly basis, denoted by δ τ − 1 , and the vector of zonal air terminal damper positions D where for the zone i , D i is defined as a ratio such that D i ∈ [ D ̲ , D ¯ ] with D ̲ and D ¯ to be the minimum and fully-open airflow damper positions. Accordingly, Δ θ τ , which is defined as Δ θ τ ≔ θ τ − θ τ − 1 , is estimated as: (5) Δ θ τ ̂ = I N ∘ W T Θ τ ∀ τ where W is a (7 × N)-dimensional coefficient matrix as: (6) W ≔ w 10 w 11 ⋯ w 16 w 20 w 21 ⋯ w 26 ⋮ ⋮ ⋱ ⋮ w N 0 w N 1 ⋯ w N 6 T Θ τ is the τ th depth of the (7 × N × T)-dimensional matrix Θ which is defined for ∀ τ ∈ T as: (7) Θ τ ≔ 1 N , θ τ − 1 , θ τ − 1 OUT 1 N , H τ − 1 OUT 1 N , R τ − 1 1 N , δ τ − 1 1 N , D T I N is an (N × N)-dimensional identity matrix, and the operator ∘ is the Hadamard product. This way, the temperature variation of the thermal zone i within time interval τ is modeled as: (8) Δ θ i τ ̂ = θ i τ − θ i ( τ − 1 ) ≔ w i T ϑ i τ ∀ τ , i = 1 , \u2026 , N where w i is the i th column of W and ϑ i τ is the i th column of Θ τ which are defined over ∀ τ ∈ T and i = 1 , \u2026 , N as: (9) w i ≔ w i 0 , w i 1 , w i 2 , w i 3 , w i 4 , w i 5 , w i 6 T (10) ϑ i τ ≔ 1 , θ i ( τ − 1 ) , θ τ − 1 OUT , H τ − 1 OUT , R τ − 1 , δ τ − 1 , D i T Further, the zonal thermal capacity to increase/decrease the zonal temperature during time interval τ can be formulated as: (11) θ ̂ τ UP = { I N ∘ W T Θ τ ∣ D = D ̲ 1 N } ∀ τ (12) θ ̂ τ DWN = { I N ∘ W T Θ τ ∣ D = D ¯ 1 N } ∀ τ where by considering two extreme cases with minimum and maximum airflow positions, i.e., D ̲ and D ¯ , the upper and lower bounds of the zonal temperature variations to increase and decrease the zonal temperature with the highest thermal capacity of the system are estimated. In order to fine-tune the regression model parameters w i for zone i , the model is trained based on a stochastic gradient descent algorithm to minimize the cost function J ( w i ) , which consists of a mean squared error (MSE) term and a ridge regularization term with parameter α to improve model generalization, and is formulated for all i = 1 , \u2026 , N as: (13) where Δ θ i ( k ) and Δ θ i ̂ ( k ) are the actual and estimated temperature variation of zone i in instance k which denotes the index of number of instances from a dataset including K number of datapoints. Now, to minimize J ( w i ) in (13), the following optimization is solved. (14) w i ∗ ≔ arg min w i ∈ R 7 { J ( w i ) ∣ α ∈ R + } i = 1 , \u2026 , N Note that in (14), R + is the positive elements of real number set R . Also, the continuous input variables are scaled based on the min\u2013max feature scaling for the training process. The resulting w i ∗ values are then fed to the day-ahead optimization model presented in (1)\u2013(3) to form the constraints associated with the zonal thermal capacities θ ̂ τ UP and θ ̂ τ DWN . 2.3 HVAC load model In order to determine the impact of an individual zone of a building on the total HVAC load, we develop another linear regression model with the HVAC load as the target variable and zonal temperature setpoints as the independent variables. It should be noted that our initial HVAC load model presented in this section is roughly estimated based on the zonal temperature setpoints to determine the contribution and impact of temperature setpoint change at each thermal zone on total HVAC load. The model accuracy can be improved by incorporating externalities, such as weather conditions, that is implemented by employing GBM in Section 4.1.5. Accordingly, the HVAC load during time interval τ is formulated as: (15) E ̂ ( θ τ ) ≔ ω 0 + ω T θ τ ∀ τ where ω ≔ ω 1 , ω 2 , \u2026 , ω N T , θ τ = θ 1 τ , θ 2 τ , \u2026 , θ N τ T . The training procedure follows the same approach as thermal capacity modeling. The resulting ω 0 ∗ and ω ∗ values are then fed to the day-ahead optimization model presented in (1)\u2013(3) to construct the first term of the objective function (1), where the optimal zonal temperature setpoints are determined and sent to the GBM module for the more accurate HVAC load estimation. For each building operating within the building cluster, at the day-ahead planning stage, a set of optimal and feasible zonal temperature setpoints are generated based on a range of penalty factor and considering a forecast of the next day\u2019s state variables, i.e., weather conditions and occupancy schedules, and available day-ahead dynamic electricity prices. Finally, the estimated HVAC load is aggregated with the lighting and equipment load estimations to yield the total load of each building that is then passed to the community-level optimization to render the proposed power flow-based day-ahead asset and flexibility scheduling model. 3 The proposed community-level day-ahead asset and flexibility scheduling model Here in this section, the proposed community-level day-ahead scheduling model is presented. The community operator co-optimizes the operation schedules of shared assets and load flexibilities, e.g. buildings\u2019 potential aggregate flexible loads and the EVs that are using community-operated charging stations. The proposed flexibility scheduling model aims at minimizing the total operation cost of the community while satisfying not only the operational constraints of various assets but also the physical constraints of the community network with different arrangements. The proposed model is formulated based on the distribution network\u2019s power flow model and is developed in mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) format, which is presented next. 3.1 Objective function The objective function of the proposed model is to minimize the total operation cost of the community, which includes costs of onsite power generation of the dispatchable generator (DG) that is approximated by the piecewise linear function with j segments, power purchased from the utility and demand charges, and the penalized loss of load which is reflected as load curtailment costs. Accordingly, the objective function is formulated as: (16) ∑ n ∈ N { ∑ t ∈ T { ( σ n t C n D G + ∑ j ∈ J C n j D G P n t j D G Δ t ) + ( λ t P t U G + γ n t P n t L C ) Δ t } } + ∑ m ∈ M μ m P m U G where σ n t is a binary variable representing the commitment status of the DG in node n that is equal to 1 if the unit is working at time t , and 0 otherwise; P n t j D G is the generated power in segment j of the DG\u2019s approximated generation cost function in node n at time t ; C n D G and C n j D G are respectively the DG\u2019s fixed and variable cost term in segment j ; λ t and P t U G are the electricity price and the power purchased from the utility at time t , respectively; P n t L C is the active load curtailment in node n at time t that is penalized by γ n t ; P m U G and μ m are the peak power purchased from utility and demand charge during time period m ; and N represents the set of nodes in the community. The peak power purchased from the utility during time period m must satisfy constraint (17) below. (17) P t U G ≤ P m U G ∀ m , t ∈ T m \u2032 The objective function (16) is subjected to the operational constraints of the community with its potential flexible loads and onsite distributed energy resources (DERs). The constraints of the proposed model are presented in the following. 3.2 Flexible load model Let decision variable P u n t F L be the rescheduled active power of flexible load u in node n at time t within the requested rescheduling time period Γ u n , which is given by the requested rescheduling start and end times denoted by t u n s t and t u n n d . Let us also assume that the rescheduled active power of flexible load u is bounded by its minimum and maximum acceptable rescheduling power levels, P u n F L ̲ and P u n F L ¯ , assuring the operational limits of the rescheduling process of the flexible load u . Fig. 2 schematically shows our definition of flexible load rescheduling process given the requested rescheduling parameters for a generic flexible load. Accordingly, P u n t F L is formulated as: (18) ρ u n t P u n F L ̲ ≤ P u n t F L ≤ ρ u n t P u n F L ¯ ∀ u , n , t ∈ Γ u n where ρ u n t is a binary variable which is equal to 1 if flexible load u in node n is rescheduled to be served at t ∈ Γ u n by the community operator, and 0 otherwise; such that Γ u n ⊆ T holds. Further, to guarantee service completion of all the flexible loads by the end of the requested rescheduling time period, service completion constraint should be deployed, which is modeled as: (19) ∑ t ∈ Γ u n P u n t F L Δ t − E u n F L 0 = E u n F L , ∀ u , n where E u n F L denotes the requested energy consumption of flexible load u in node n over Γ u n to be fully-served while the initial/already-received energy level is assumed to be E u n F L 0 . For instance, an EV with an initial state-of-charge (SoC) of 10% can be served as a flexible load while assuring to be fully charged by the requested rescheduling end time. It should be noted that the rescheduled reactive power of a flexible load follows the power triangle relationship with a given power factor. 3.3 Dispatchable Generator (DG) model Dispatchable generating units, e.g., micro gas turbines and diesel-fueled generators, have been long utilized as backup generators. Assuming a piecewise linear production cost function with j segments [2], the total active and reactive power generation of DG in node n at time t , denoted by P n t D G and Q n t D G respectively, are formulated as: (20) P n t D G = σ n t P n D G ̲ + ∑ j ∈ J P n t j D G , ∀ n , t (21) 0 ≤ P n t j D G ≤ σ n t P n j D G ¯ , ∀ n , t , j (22) P n t D G 2 + Q n t D G 2 ≤ S n D G ¯ 2 , ∀ n , t (23) P F n D G ̲ ≤ P n t D G P n t D G 2 + Q n t D G 2 , ∀ n , t where P n t j D G , which is the generated active power in segment j in node n at time t is bounded in constraint (21) by the maximum generation capacity limit of the DG denoted by P n j D G ¯ ; P n D G ̲ and S n D G ¯ are the minimum active power generation and maximum apparent power generation capacity limits of the DG in node n with minimum power factor P F n D G ̲ . Further, ramping up/down constraint of DG is formulated as: (24) − P n D G , D ≤ P n t D G − P n ( t − 1 ) D G ≤ P n D G , U ∀ n , t where P n D G , U and P n D G , D are ramp up and down capabilities of DG in node n . 3.4 Solar Photovoltaic (PV) model Given the day-ahead solar irradiance estimation in node n at time t , denoted by R n t , the active solar power generation of the PV plant, denoted by P n t P V ¯ , is calculated as: (25) P n t P V ¯ = P n P V ¯ R n t 2 R s t d R c 0 ≤ R n t < R c P n P V ¯ R n t R s t d R c ≤ R n t < R s t d P n P V ¯ R s t d ≤ R n t over ∀ n ∈ N and ∀ t ∈ T , where P n P V ¯ is the rated capacity of the PV plant; R c is certain solar irradiance point set to 150 W m 2 ; and R s t d is the solar irradiance in standard conditions that equals to 1000 W m 2 [26]. The solar power generation that is calculated here is assumed to be the available solar power capacity to be optimally dispatched by the community operator depending on the operation conditions. Consequently, the active and reactive power injections to the community, denoted by P n t P V and Q n t P V , are formulated as: (26) 0 ≤ P n t P V ≤ P n t P V ¯ , ∀ n , t (27) P n t P V 2 + Q n t P V 2 ≤ S n P V ¯ 2 , ∀ n , t (28) P F n P V ̲ ≤ P n t P V P n t P V 2 + Q n t P V 2 , ∀ n , t where P F n P V ̲ is the minimum power factor of the solar PV inverter located in node n . 3.5 Energy Storage System (ESS) model As one of the unique energy storage systems (ESS) functionalities, here we use Electric Energy Time Shift application that means storing energy during low prices and releasing the stored energy at times of either high prices or emergencies. Hence, the charge/discharge process of ESS is modeled as: (29) 0 ≤ P n t c h ≤ β n t P n E S ¯ ∀ n , t (30) 0 ≤ P n t d c h ≤ 1 − β n t P n E S ¯ ∀ n , t (31) P n t c h + P n t d c h 2 + Q n t E S 2 ≤ S n E S ¯ 2 ∀ n , t (32) Q n t E S 2 ≤ P n t c h + P n t d c h 2 ∀ n , t (33) E n t = E n ( t − 1 ) + ( η n c h P n t c h − 1 η n d c h P n t d c h ) Δ t ∀ n , t (34) E n ̲ ≤ E n t ≤ E n ¯ ∀ n , t where constraints (29)\u2013(32) restrict both active and reactive charging and discharging powers to not exceed the rated active and apparent power capacities of the ESS located in node n , which is denoted by P n E S ¯ and S n E S ¯ , respectively. P n t c h and P n t d c h are the active charging and discharging powers at time t with β n t to be a binary variable modeling charge/discharge process of the ESS in node n at time t which avoids simultaneous charge and discharge processes. Also, Q n t E S is a free variable representing reactive charging and discharging powers of the ESS. Moreover, Eq. (33) models dynamic energy balance of the ESS considering its charging and discharging efficiency denoted by η n c h and η n d c h , where E n t models the energy stored in ESS in node n at time t . Note that the active charging and discharging powers here are assumed to be the powers drawn from and released/injected to the node that ESS is connected to, respectively. Moreover, we assume the ESS to be equipped with a bi-directional advanced inverter that can perform both active and reactive power control without any capacitor banks. 3.6 Distribution network power flow model coupled with flexibilities Considering the available onsite assets and flexible loads, the active and reactive power balance equations in node n at time t are formulated as: (35) (36) over ∀ n , t , where P l t L and Q l t L are the active and reactive power flows of line l ; U n is set of flexible loads in node n ; and L n + and L n − are sets of lines defined to be to node n and from node n, respectively ( L n + , L n − ⊆ L ). The apparent power of the load connected to node n at time t , denoted by S n t , is modeled as S n t = P n t + i Q n t , where the active and reactive power components are composed of potential flexible and inflexible loads denoted as P n t = P n t I L + P n t F L 0 and Q n t = Q n t I L + Q n t F L 0 . r l + i x l is the complex impedance on the line l ∈ L , and r n + i x n is the shunt impedance from node n to the ground; hence, shunt admittance is calculated as 1 r n + i x n = g n + i b n . Also, ℓ l ≔ | I l | 2 and v n ≔ | V n | 2 are defined such that V n ≔ v n e i ϕ n and I l ≔ ℓ l e i ( ϕ n − ∠ S l L ) where ϕ n is the voltage phase angle of node n and S l L ≔ P l L + i Q l L ; thereby, ∠ S l L = tan − 1 ( Q l L P l L ) . The voltage and the active and reactive power flow constraints are formulated as follows in (37)\u2013(40) based on branch flow model adopted from [27] over ∀ n , t , l ∈ L n . (37) v n t − v n \u2032 t = − 2 r l P l t L + x l Q l t L + r l 2 + x l 2 ℓ l t (38) v n ̲ ≤ | V n t | 2 ≤ v n ¯ (39) P l t L 2 + Q l t L 2 v n t ≤ ℓ l t (40) ℓ l t ≤ I l ¯ 2 where n and n \u2032 are from and to nodes of line l , respectively. Note that P n t U G = Q n t U G = 0 for all the non-reference/slack nodes in the community, i.e. the slack node is assumed to be the only node connected to the upstream utility grid with V n t = 1 p.u. ∠ 0 . From Eqs. (35) and (36), optimal rescheduled load in node n at time t is obtained as S ˜ n t = P ˜ n t + i Q ˜ n t , ∀ n , t . Moreover, to ensure feasible active and reactive load curtailments as the last resort of the community operator during emergencies, constraint (41) must be satisfied. (41) 0 ≤ P n t L C ≤ P n t I L + ∑ u ∈ U n P u n t F L ∀ n , t In summary, Eqs. (16)\u2013(41) present the proposed asset and flexibility scheduling model, which is formulated as a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem and can be solved using commercial MINLP solvers. 4 Case study and numerical results In this section, the proposed two-level asset and flexibility scheduling model is implemented on an actual building cluster located in Qatar University where a campus microgrid illustrated in Fig. 3 is proposed to be deployed. The building cluster is composed of four buildings including, a kindergarden, the Women\u2019s Foundation, the Classroom buildings, and the Student/Faculty Housing Complex, which are labeled as B2\u2013B5 on the campus map, respectively. The buildings within the cluster are then connected and form a 6-node microgrid configuration that is coupled to Doha\u2019s 11kV, 50 Hz distribution network via the proposed medium voltage substation located at B1. Also, there is a normally-open tie-line connecting buildings B4 and B5 which is designed for emergency cases, including islanded operation due to utility outages, substation and/or feeder/equipment failures, or maintenance. The substation transfers the utility\u2019s 11kV feeder to the campus to serve the buildings that are equipped with the step-down 11kV/415V transformers. The conductor AC resistance and inductive reactance of feeders 1 1 The feeders are considered to be XLPE/PVC 3-core copper cables with a conductor size of 25 mm 2 , and 11kV, 50 Hz with the current rating of 145A. at 50 Hz , 90 °C are considered 0.927 and 0.132 Ω /km, respectively. The building- and community-level features and input data are presented next. 4.1 Building-level data 4.1.1 Building cluster geometry The building B2\u2013B5 geometries are shown in Fig. 4, where construction material and design strategies are rendered based on ASHRAE 189.1 and 90.1 green construction codes [28] for climate zone 1B 2 2 Climate Zone 1B is defined as Dry with 5000 < CDD10 °C ≤ 6000 where CDD stands for Cooling Degree Days. [29], which best represents Qatar\u2019s weather conditions. Note that due to the limited actual data for building B5, which is a housing complex, it is mapped and simulated as a large hotel in the building cluster. Weather data is based on historical Typical Meteorological Year 2 (TMY2) [30] and is calibrated based on the actual monthly metered data. Moreover, in all the four building models, the HVAC systems are central Air Handling Units (AHU) supplied with dedicated chiller plants along with No-Reheat Variable Air Volume (VAV) terminal units dedicated to each thermal zone. Table 1 presents the annual electricity consumption, the conditioned floor area, and the number of controlled zones associated with each building within the building cluster. 4.1.2 Thermal capacity model training The thermal capacity values are estimated for each thermal zone in the buildings based on the simulation data, where we have 138, 101, 77, and 179 sets of data for buildings B2\u2013B5, respectively. It should be noted that building B5 is not considered as a controllable HVAC load in this paper due to the data limitations mentioned earlier in this section. The tabular presentation of a sample dataset associated with a zone within the cluster with 8760 × 4 instances is shown in Table 2. The data is apportioned into training and test sets for each zone with an 80\u201320 split. The model performance for each building is then evaluated through the test sets by calculating the mean absolute error (MAE) metric as follows: (42) MAE i = 1 K ∑ k = 1 K | Δ θ i ( k ) − Δ θ i ̂ ( k ) | i = 1 , \u2026 , N where Δ θ i ( k ) and Δ θ i ̂ ( k ) are the actual and the estimated temperature variations of zone i in instance k . The average performance metric of each building over all thermal zones is presented in Table 3, along with the best regularizing factor, which improves the average MAE values for each building. 4.1.3 HVAC load model training The training procedure of the HVAC model follows the same approach as the thermal capacity model training. Each building possesses one dataset, which takes a tabular form demonstrated in the example shown in Table 4 associated with building B3 with 101 zones. Also, to generate more variation in the dataset, zonal setpoints are randomly sampled from a Bernoulli random walk with i.i.d. increments, each of them being ＋0.5 °C or −0.5 °C, equally likely, and within 20 °C and 27 °C at each timestep of the simulation. Note that the minimum and maximum bounds, which are θ ̲ and θ ¯ in constraint (3), are assumed to be reflection points in our simulated random walk. The model performance in estimating each building\u2019s HVAC load is evaluated by calculating MAE over the test set. The resulted MAEs and the proper regularization parameters are shown in Table 5. 4.1.4 Day-ahead zonal optimal setpoints Now that the thermal capacity and HVAC load models have been trained, the day-ahead locational marginal prices (LMP) and the weather data are deployed to optimize the corresponding zonal setpoints. The LMP and weather data and the resulted optimal zonal setpoints are respectively illustrated in Figs. 5 and 6 for a sample consecutive three days horizon. In Fig. 6, the rows are associated with each building, i.e., B2, B3, and B4, and the columns represent the penalty factor η that ranges from 1 to 10−4. Also, each plot presents multiple lines, each of which is associated with an individual zone and with respect to their actual thermal capacity. The setpoint variations are triggered based on the zone\u2019s influence on the HVAC load and the deviation from a comfort level. As can be seen from Fig. 6, there is a wide variation among the optimal setpoint schedules, and this variation even increases by relaxing the comfort deviation penalty term. Given the optimal setpoints, the Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) is leveraged in the next section to estimate the day-ahead HVAC loads of the buildings with much more accuracy compared to the linear model developed in Section 4.1.3. 4.1.5 Day-ahead HAVC load estimation using GBM Here we use a regressor based on GBM, an ensemble of sequential predictors, each trained to correct its predecessor. GBM is an ensemble of sequential predictors, each of which is trained to correct its predecessor. GBM is usually an ensemble of decision trees for classification and regression tasks. The number of the ensemble of regressors depends on the progress towards improving the error term and can be found by assigning a threshold for model performance improvement or through search methods. The resulted optimal setpoints and the exogenous variables, including weather data and the time-of-day, are employed to develop the GBM-based day-ahead HVAC load estimator. The model generalization can also be improved by fine-tuning hyperparameters, e.g., the maximum depth of the decision tree regressors, through an exhaustive search and cross-validation with three folds. The mean absolute error of the GBM-based regressor for the buildings, as well as the best-performing hyperparameters, are shown in Table 6. Fig. 7 shows HVAC load scenarios for buildings B2\u2013B4 given different penalty terms, which result in a set of eleven optimal temperature setpoints and corresponding HVAC load trajectories denoted by Sc1\u2013Sc11 for each building. The community operator can efficiently direct the building cluster to follow a particular aggregate load scenario under different circumstances leading to normal or islanded operations. The estimated HVAC load scenarios are then summed up with the lighting and equipment loads to yield the building\u2019s total load scenarios fed to the community-level optimization model next. Note that all the building-level optimization models are solved using Gurobi 9.0 Python-API gurobipy [31] and GBM is developed employing Scikit-Learn API [32] on a system with a Core i7-8700 processor at 3.20GHz and 64GB of RAM. The computation time for each building simulation over a year with a 15 min time interval was about an hour on average. 4.2 Community-level data The 6-node campus microgrid operates the following shared assets, the operation of which are co-optimized by our proposed two-level scheduling model. \u2022 A solar-plus-storage system connected to the feed point at N2 with a PV inverter\u2019s rated active power output to be 450kW and a battery energy storage (BES) sized at 150kW/600kWh with a charge and discharge efficiency of 90%. The PV inverter\u2019s apparent power capacity and minimum power factor are assumed to be 540kVA and 0.85, respectively. The minimum and maximum energy capacities of the BES are assumed to be 10% and 100%, respectively, while its initial stored energy is set to 200kWh. Also, the apparent power capacity of the BES\u2019s advanced inverter is set to 180kVA. \u2022 A 650kW emergency diesel-fueled generator (DG) located at N1 that is operated during emergencies. The apparent power capacity and the minimum power factor of the DG are assumed to be 780kVA and 0.85, respectively. The DG has a ramping capability of 130kW/min [33], with a generation cost function approximated by a fixed cost of $50 and a piecewise three-segment linear function with the parameters presented in Table 7. \u2022 An EV charging station (EVCS) located at N6 with 11 chargers, 3 of which are equipped with DC fast charging (DCFC) and the remaining dedicated to Level 2 service with an intelligent charge controller for smart charging purposes. The average rated powers drawn by level 2 and DCFC are assumed to be 7 and 50kW, respectively. The EVCS is occupied in two main time buckets, including 8:00am-4:00pm and 9:00pm-6:00am during which the EVs\u2019 charging events are co-optimized. In the former time bucket, six of the level 2 chargers and two of the DCFCs are occupied to receive 4 and 1 h of aggregate charging requests, respectively, while in the latter time frame, the EVCS is fully occupied to receive 6 and 1 h of aggregate charging requests for level 2 and DCFC users. It is assumed that the EVs are normally energized from the beginning of the time bucket until they are fully charged. The initial SoCs are randomly generated, ranging uniformly between 10% and 20%. Note that EV chargers typically use a boost converter to perform active power factor correction (PFC); therefore, EV charging is assumed to be a pure resistive process that only draws active power. \u2022 A set of aggregate nodal flexible loads that are identified as part of the total demand at each node capable of being rescheduled given an acceptable minimum and maximum load level over a requested service time period. The characteristics of the aggregate flexible loads are presented in Table 8. The final 6-node campus MG configuration is shown in Fig. 8 where the dashed lines represent the standby/normally-open assets/lines that are designed to be online during the emergency operation. From the resulted set of eleven load scenarios for each building spanning over the three consecutive days, we extract a 24-hour time window for each building starting from 7:00am of the first day, and select the top four scenarios with more variations to be fed to the community-level scheduling model. Thus, building and community flexibilities are co-optimized to unlock the buildings\u2019 adaptability in various operation conditions. We also assume typical power factors [34] that are 0.85 for N3\u2013N5 and 0.90 for N6. To investigate the performance of the proposed two-level assets and flexibility scheduling model, four cases are studied, including: \u2022 Case I: Grid-connected Operation w/o Flexibilities \u2022 Case II: Grid-connected Operation w/ Flexibilities \u2022 Case III: Islanded Operation w/o Flexibilities \u2022 Case IV: Islanded Operation w/ Flexibilities where the flexibilities in Cases II and IV include both buildings\u2019 aggregate flexible loads and EV loads to be charged in the EVCS located at N6. The proposed community-level MINLP model is solved using BARON solver [35] under GAMS, on a computer with a Core i5-3337U processor at 1.80GHz and 12GB of RAM. The average computation times to obtain the optimal solutions with an optimality gap of 1.5% for each scenario, including normal and emergency operations, are 3.2 and 2.7 min for the cases w/ and w/o flexibilities, respectively. The results are presented next. 4.3 Results and discussions 4.3.1 Operation cost and MG adaptability Table 9 summarizes the MG operation costs for a selected number of our considered 64 scenarios in Cases II and IV, where the potential flexibilities are available to help the MG operator to adapt the consumption profile. As can be seen from Table 9, the best scenario in Case II that brings about the minimum operation costs of the MG would be scenario 16, while in Case IV, when the MG is in the islanded mode, scenario 15 would be the best strategy that directs MG\u2019s buildings located in nodes N3\u2013N6 to adapt to their demand scenarios 3, 4, 1, and 1, respectively. It should be noted that the average operation costs in Cases I and III without considering flexibilities are $11,340 and $4,811,763, respectively. Accordingly, by comparing the operation costs of the MG in Cases I and II, i.e., $11,340 in Case I and $8,953.68 in Case II, a considerable cost reduction of 21.04%, that is calculated from 11 , 340 − 8 , 953 . 68 11 , 340 × 100 % , is realized. This clearly shows the notable impacts of flexibilities in reducing the MG\u2019s operation costs and increasing the MG\u2019s adaptability under different operation conditions. The best load scenarios, i.e., scenarios 16 and 15, are considered from now on for Cases II and IV, respectively. 4.3.2 Flexibility schedules & load curtailments Figs. 9 and 10 illustrate normal and rescheduled total active and reactive loads of the MG in all four cases. As can be seen from both Figures, the potential flexibilities shown in Subfigures (a) and (b) are rescheduled to flatten total active and reactive loads avoiding peak price spikes and huge demand charges (see Subfigures (c) and (d)). Load curtailments that are shown in Fig. 10, likewise, follow the flattening behavior to avoid huge load curtailments, although the penalized curtailments are treated the same in different time intervals from the MG operator\u2019s point of view. Fig. 11 demonstrates the contribution of each flexible load in the optimal day-ahead nodal rescheduled loads in Cases II and IV. We can see that different flexibility schedules in Cases II and IV enable the MG adaptability under different operation conditions that is also revealed in Section 4.3.1. Moreover, Fig. 12 depicts the optimal day-ahead schedules of all types of flexibilities in Cases II and IV at node N6, which includes the aggregate B5\u2019s and EVCS\u2019s flexibilities. 4.3.3 Energy storage dynamic capacity Fig. 13 shows the optimal day-ahead dynamic BES energy capacity in all cases. It can be seen that part of the contribution of BES is substituted by flexible loads that are optimally rescheduled to modify the demand (see the results in cases I and II). In Case I, the BES is fully charged to perform its unique energy\u2013time-shift functionality, while in Case II, the BES is partially charged due to the peak load reduction stemmed from the rescheduled flexible loads. Also, in Cases III and IV, the BES optimally releases its initial stored energy to cover part of the load due to insufficient onsite power generation capacity, which leads to load curtailments. 4.3.4 Nodal voltages & feeder power flows The nodal voltage profiles are illustrated in Fig. 14. From Subfigures (a) and (b), we can see the impacts of flexibility schedules in flattening the voltage profiles, leading to a more stable MG operation with better power quality. Note that the upper and lower limits of the voltage magnitude at each node are assumed to be 0.9 p.u. and 1.05 p.u., respectively. Moreover, Fig. 15 depicts active power flows of feeders in four cases, where the contribution of rescheduling flexibilities in reducing feeder loads can be observed. From Subfigures (c) and (d), it can be seen that the tie-line\u2019s power flow in emergency operation is almost zero if the flexibilities are optimally rescheduled. 4.3.5 Energy procurement from available assets/sources Finally, Figs. 16 and 17 depict the day-ahead total active and reactive demand supplies from the available assets in all four cases. As can be observed from Fig. 16.(a), BES in Case I is charging in the early morning during hours 7:00 am to 9:00 am when the LMPs are low, while it is discharging during time period when the LMPs are high from 6:00 pm to 9:00 pm (see Fig. 5 for LMPs profile). On the other hand, BES in Case II is following almost the same charging/discharging pattern; but in a more distributed way caused by the more distributed rescheduled flexible loads which leads to a more flattened load profile in Case II (see Fig. 16.(b)). Also, Subfigures (c) and (d) show that BES is just discharging and not charging in Cases III and IV where the community is operated in the islanded mode. In addition, Subfigures (a) and (b) in Fig. 17 illustrate the impacts of flexibility scheduling in the contribution of BES in supplying reactive power of the community in Cases I and II where the community is operated in the grid-connected mode. It can be observed that the reactive power supply by the BES is more distributed in Case II compared with Case I where the flexibilities are not incorporated. 5 Conclusion This paper proposed a hierarchical two-level optimization framework that aids community operators in enhancing the adaptability of the community\u2019s operation by capturing the joint-flexibilities of the connected buildings in a cooperative energy management strategy. The proposed model coupled community- and building-level least-cost optimization problems where the former was designed to balance the community network involving various onsite distributed energy resources (DERs) and joint-flexibilities among connected buildings, while the latter was designed to optimize zonal temperature setpoints in response to day-ahead weather conditions, occupancy, and electricity price estimations given a comfort level. A test community network including four verified EnergyPlus building models representing a real building cluster at Qatar University was implemented within a 6-node microgrid (MG) configuration to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed tow-level day-ahead scheduling model. The simulation results showed that the buildings\u2019 HVAC load estimations rendered by Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) is much more accurate than the initial linear regression models by calculating the mean absolute errors (MAE) of the two estimation methods. Moreover, we demonstrated how zonal temperature setpoints optimization with thermal mapping gives the community operator a set of demand profile scenarios in response to the optimal temperature setpoints given the range of penalty factors, rather than a single demand profile that does not provide any operational flexibilities. Further, by analyzing the obtained results, the impacts of flexibility rescheduling on better shaping the MG\u2019s aggregate demand profile, nodal voltages, and power flows of the feeder lines under various operation conditions were revealed. Our findings show that by employing the proposed tiered two-level framework, community operators can strategically reschedule the identified potential joint-flexibilities among the connected buildings to cut the community\u2019s operation cost noticeably, which was 21.04% in our real case study. Moreover, by co-optimizing the schedules of the onsite shared assets, the community operator can direct the building cluster to enhance the operation adaptability under different operation conditions. Therefore, thermal mapping of controlled zones, as well as building- and community-level demand flexibilities if optimally reschedules, can enhance the adaptability of the community under different operation conditions. Research limitations in this paper fall in the exogenous data quality and availability within the community, e.g., actual plan of the buildings, occupancy patterns and schedules, and buildings\u2019 functionalities and specs with given thermal zones, that are needed to develop the community\u2019s digital twin with potential capabilities stemming from thermal mapping and demand flexibilities. Undoubtedly, a community that embraces buildings with no inherent demand flexibilities and controllable thermal zones cannot be fitted into our proposed model which aims at adaptability of the community under different operation conditions. Also, future research will focus on developing a real-time control-oriented framework which employs predictive models to capture the day-ahead forecast/estimation errors by adaptable recourse actions through flexibility rescheduling in the community. Moreover, probabilistic analysis of the proposed tiered two-level model is in order where the uncertainty sources such as renewables and electricity prices are characterized, and the risk involved in providing demand flexibilities is incorporated to enable more accurate decision-making in the community operation scheduling scheme.

The proposed framework comprises a community-level power flow-based model to solve the energy procurement problem of the community and a building-level physics-aware simulation model to estimate a set of day-ahead aggregate load scenarios with potential joint-flexibilities. At the building-level, a least-cost multi-objective optimization provides a sequence of optimal temperature setpoints for all thermal zones that is fed into an accurate Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) to estimate heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) load trajectories while considering human comfort, occupancy patterns, building thermal response, and intraday electricity prices. The community-level model co-optimizes day-ahead schedules of shared distributed energy resources (DERs) and electric vehicle (EV) chargings while directing the building cluster to adapt the joint-flexibilities to balance the community network under different operation conditions. Finally, a test building cluster located in Qatar University is investigated through several case studies. The simulation results reveal the model\u2019s practicality in fully capturing the joint-flexibilities of the building cluster for an adaptable community operation which cuts the operation cost by 21.04%.",
