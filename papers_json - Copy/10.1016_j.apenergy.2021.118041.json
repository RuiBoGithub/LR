Machine-learning (ML) \u2013based building models have been gaining popularity in constructing model predictive control (MPC) for building energy management applications. However, ML-based building models are usually nonlinear so to capture the building dynamics, leading to high computation load for MPC, prohibiting its application for real-time building control. This study proposes a ML-based MPC with an instantaneous linearization (IL) scheme, which employs real-time building operation data to linearize the nonlinear ML-based building model for constructing a linear MPC at each control interval. The proposed ML-based MPC with IL system is implemented to control an air conditioning system in an office of a general hospital building located in Singapore for experimental evaluation of its control performance. The ML-based MPC with IL is compared to a ML-based MPC that directly uses a nonlinear ML-based building model and the original reactive-control-based thermostat of the office. Results show that the ML-based MPC with IL significantly reduced the computation time (by more than 70 times) as compared to the ML-based MPC while retained most of the advantages of the ML-based MPC. The ML-based MPC with IL and the ML-based MPC achieved 31.6% and 26.0% reductions, respectively, in cooling energy consumption as compared to the original thermostat. Meanwhile, both the MPC systems significantly improved indoor thermal comfort for the office as compared to the original thermostat. The study demonstrated that using IL for ML-based MPC could substantially improve computation efficiency with no obvious performance degradation in terms of thermal comfort and energy saving.

Studies suggest that energy efficiency is essential to address the rising energy demand in buildings [3] and building energy management (BEM) is a crucial approach to achieving building energy efficiency [4]. As most of building energy consumption is due to the operation of different building service systems (e.g., heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems [5] or air-conditioning and mechanical ventilation (ACMV) [6] systems in tropical areas), equipping BEM systems with advanced control techniques to optimize the operation of these systems could achieve significant improvements of energy efficiency and occupant\u2019s well-being in buildings [7]. Model predictive control (MPC) is one of the most promising advanced control techniques for BEM applications [8]. Many previous studies have demonstrated that MPC can greatly improve the building energy efficiency and human comfort compared to the conventional practice of reactive-based control (e.g., proportional\u2013integral\u2013derivative (PID) and on/off) [9]. Instead of basing the control logic entirely on reacting to sensor feedback, MPC predicts the future response (e.g., room air temperature and thermal comfort) of the controlled building by exploiting a predictive building model and the future disturbances (e.g., weather, energy price, internal heat loads) and, subsequently, optimize the operation of the building service systems in a predictive manner [10]. The predictive model of the controlled building is a key element of MPC for BEM applications [11]. Different modelling approaches, including physics-based [12] and machine-learning (ML) \u2013 based [13] approaches, have been proposed for developing building models. The physics-based modelling approach explicitly depicts the heat and mass transfers in buildings and building systems (e.g., ACMV, lighting and shading) as well as their interactions with outdoor environments [14] using differential equations. For control purpose, physics-based building models are usually developed in simplified form (e.g., thermal resistance\u2013capacitance (RC) network) to reduce the computational load of MPC [15]. Many studies used the simplified physics-based building modelling approach including first-order [16], second-order [17] or higher-order [18\u201319] thermal RC networks to construct MPC for BEM applications. However, the development of a physics-based building model is time-consuming and requires high level of expertise in building physics [20], making it prohibitive to widely implement MPC for buildings using physics-based models (or \u2018physics-based MPC\u2019). The ML-based building modelling approach is an alternative to overcome the aforementioned issue of the physics-based modelling approach [21]. A ML-based building model can be developed based on data without knowing the building physics. Thus, ML could eliminate the need for expertise in building physics and significantly cut down the model development time compared to the physics-based modelling approach. MPC using ML-based building models (\u2018ML-based MPC\u2019) for BEM applications are reported in some previous studies. Smarra et al. [22] used different ML algorithms including regression trees and random forests to develop building models and subsequently construct MPC controllers for controlling heating and cooling systems. Reynolds et al. [23] developed an artificial neural network (ANN) \u2013 based building model to construct a MPC controller for controlling a heating system. Ferreira et al. [24] developed an artificial neural network (ANN) \u2013 based building model to construct a MPC controller for controlling an HVAC system. These studies suggested that the ML-based MPC has comparable control performance as physics-based MPC. However, in order to capture the complex building dynamics, ML-based building models are usually nonlinear, leading to nonconvex optimization problems that are computationally demanding to solve. This brings another challenge to the applications of ML-based MPC for real-time building control. The solutions of the optimization problem in MPC, i.e., the control commands, must be obtained within a control interval so that the control command applied to the building at each control interval is always the latest one. For complex buildings involving many systems and units, especially for those equipped with low-cost control hardware (e.g., embedded controller), reaching a solution for the optimization problem within a control time interval is prohibitively challenging. A possible solution is to employ the concept of instantaneous linearization (IL) [25], which can generate a linear model at each control interval by locally linearizing the nonlinear ML-based building model around the measured operation point. The linearized building model is then used to construct a linear MPC controller at each control interval. The linearized model generated by IL retains the high prediction accuracy of the original nonlinear ML-based model around the current operation point (e.g., within the current control interval of MPC) and results in a convex optimization problem that is computationally efficient for MPC [26]. Similar concept of incorporating IL to linearize ML-based MPC has been proposed and applied to control different nonlinear dynamic systems in industrial applications (e.g., gas turbine engine [27], liquid extractor [28], etc.). These studies indicated that ML-based MPC systems incorporating IL provide much better computational efficiency than those without. However, the adoption of IL for ML-based MPC in order to enable real-time building control is lacking in the literature. This study aims to demonstrate that IL can be applied to ML-based MPC to unlock its potential in real-time building control applications. A novel ML-based MPC system with IL to manage ACMV systems for optimal energy efficiency and thermal comfort in buildings is proposed. The proposed MPC system features an instantaneous building model linearization scheme that can linearize the ML-based building model at each control interval. The proposed MPC system is implemented in an office inside a hospital building located in Singapore to control an ACMV system. The control performance of the proposed MPC system is experimentally compared to a ML-based MPC (without IL) and the original thermostat of the office that employs the PID control method. 2 Methodology 2.1 Overview Fig. 1 shows the framework of the methodology employed to develop the ML-based MPC with IL. Historical operation data (weather conditions, internal heat loads, ACMV variables and room conditions) of a building running in its original control are collected and stored in a database. The data is then used to train an initial ML-based building model, followed by employing a model linearization algorithm to linearize it at an operation point that is randomly selected from the historical operation data set for generating an initial linear building model for the development of an initial MPC controller. This initial MPC controller is then implemented to control the building in place of its original control. As the building operates with the MPC controller, at each control interval, the real-time building operation data is fed back to the ML-based building model to re-generate the linearized building model, which is then used to re-construct the MPC controller before its optimization algorithm would start to search the optimal control commands for the building. The real-time building operation data is also fed back to the database for recurrent adaptation of the ML-based building model at a time interval. 2.2 Test building The ML-based MPC with IL was implemented in an office located at the basement of a major general hospital located in Singapore for testing. Fig. 2 shows the internal layout and experimental setup of the office. The floor area of the office is 100 m2 and it has two main areas, i.e., an open office area and a meeting area. The open office area has a seating capacity of 25 occupants. Since the door of the meeting area is always open, the entire room space of the office is considered as one thermal zone in this study. The enclosing walls of the office are made of 1.5-m-thick concrete masonry units. The office has 18 lighting fixtures fitted on the false ceiling with a power rating of 45 W each. 2.2.1 ACMV system Air-conditioning of the office is provided by a fan coil unit (FCU) as shown in Fig. 3 . The FCU consists of a cooling coil having a total cooling capacity of 15 kW and a constant air volume (CAV) fan supplying 2300 m3/hr of conditioned air into the office through four diffusers shown in Fig. 2. The primary air supplied to the FCU comes from a primary air unit (PAU). Temperature of the primary air was maintained within the range of 25\u201327 °C during the experiments. Room air returns to the FCU through two return grilles, as shown in Fig. 2, and the ceiling air plenum. The FCU is originally controlled by a thermostat at the location as indicated in Fig. 2. The thermostat, which is PID-based, regulates the flowrate of the chilled water going through the cooling coil using a modulating water valve according to a setpoint temperature of the room air. The setpoint temperature of the room air is adjustable between 22 and 26 °C. The thermostat also regulates the flowrate of the primary air using a motorized air damper according to a room CO2 concentration setpoint of 700 ppm (parts-per-million). The FCU is manually switched on in the morning and switched off in the evening by the occupants when they arrive/leave the office on workdays. 2.2.2 Instrumentation To facilitate the implementation of the ML-based MPC with IL and the subsequent control performance evaluation, several sensors are installed in the office room space and the ACMV system, as shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. A combined temperature and relative humidity (RH) sensor (TH) and a globe temperature sensor (G) were installed in the room space as shown in Fig. 2 to measure room air temperature, RH and globe temperature for calculating predicted mean vote (PMV), a widely-adopted thermal comfort index [29], which is also used in this study. The occupant\u2019s metabolic rate (0.57 met/person) and clothing level (1.2 clo) for PMV evaluation were assumed to be constant according to office dressing and activity. The air velocity in the room is assumed to be constant at 0.1 m/s as suggested by Armstrong [30], for PMV evaluation. A thermal energy meter (E) is installed in the chilled water loop of the FCU, as shown in Fig. 3, to measure the cooling power provided by the chilled water based on the measured supply and return temperatures as well as flowrate of chilled water. Other sensors including combined temperature \u2013 RH (TH), air flowrate (F) and CO2 (C) sensors were installed in the air loop of the FCU, as shown in Fig. 3. The specifications of the sensors are listed in Table 1 . A manual selector (shown in Fig. 3) is installed in the office to allow the experimenters and the occupants to switch the control of the chilled water valve of the FCU between the original thermostat and the MPC system as described in Section 2.3. 2.3 MPC system Fig. 4 shows the architecture of the proposed ML-based MPC system with IL. The system consists of a MPC controller, a local controller, a model adaption module, a model linearization module and a database module. The initial MPC controller is developed using the historical building operation data as the building was controlled by its original control as described in Section 2.1. When the MPC system is in control, the MPC controller generates manipulated variables (MVs) (optimal cooling power set-points for the FCU in this case) in the prediction horizon and sends the MV of the first control interval in that horizon to the local controller. The local controller, which is PID-based, tracks the MV by regulating the actuators (chilled water valve) of the FCU. As the building operates, real-time building operation data including the MVs, measured outputs (MOs, e.g., indoor conditions) and measured disturbances (MDs, e.g., internal heat loads) are sent and stored in the database. The model adaption module updates the ML-based building model recurringly using the building operation data in the database at an interval of once per day. This model update interval is used because one day covers a full cycle of ACMV operation and the building operation data of one day are considered large enough to enhance the prediction accuracy of the ML-based building model. The data used for the model update at each one-day time interval include the historical building operation data used for training the initial machine learning model aforementioned in Section 2.1 as well as the building operation data measured during the MPC operation time. The model linearization module generates the linearized building model based on real-time building operation data recurringly at each control interval. The descriptions of the specific MVs, MOs and MDs for this office in this study are given in Table 2 . 2.4 MPC controller The MPC controller searches the optimal cooling power set-points for the FCU in the prediction horizon using an objective function, as described by Equation (1), which aims to minimize the cooling energy consumed by the FCU, the deviation of PMV from the reference value and the violation of the constraints. (1) J = M i n i m i z e ( ∑ k = 1 N Q clg , t + k sf Q + ∑ k = 1 N [ W PMV ( PMV t + k - PMV ref ) / sf PMV ] 2 + W ε ε t + k 2 , which yields, - 0.5 - ε ≤ P M V ≤ 0.5 + ε , and, 0 ≤ Q clg ≤ Q cc The symbols J, Q, sf, PMV, W, N, and ε refer to objective, heat flow rate (W), scaling factor, PMV index, penalty factor, prediction horizon, and slack variable. Subscripts ref, clg, cc, and k refer to reference, cooling, cooling capacity and index of time steps. The three terms on the right side of Equation (1) refer to the costs of cooling energy consumption, thermal discomfort and violation of the constraints, respectively. Cooling power (Qclg ) in the cooling energy consumption term is a MV and indoor thermal comfort (PMV) in the thermal discomfort term is a MO, as summarised in Table 2. The constraint of indoor PMV is (−0.5, 0.5), which is the comfortable thermal comfort range [31]. The PMV constraint is softened by the stack variable (ε), which allows indoor PMV to exceed the constraint in the expense of adding cost (third term) in the objective function. The reference PMV value is set to be 0, representing thermal neutrality [31]. The cooling power of the FCU is constrained within its cooling capacity. The scaling factors for the cooling power (sfQ ) and PMV (sfPMV ) are set as the cooling capacity of the FCU and the magnitude of the comfortable PMV range, respectively, for normalizing cooling power and PMV. The penalty factors for thermal discomfort (WPMV ) are set at 4, which prioritizes minimizing thermal discomfort (second term) over minimizing cooling energy consumption (first term). The weighting factor of the constraints ( W ε ) is set as 10,000, which adds a very large cost in the objective function if indoor PMV exceeds the constraint in order to minimize constraint violation. The control interval and prediction horizon are 5-min and 12 control intervals, respectively, i.e. optimization of MPC is executed every 5 min and the cost described by Equation (1) for each optimization covers future one hour (N = 12 control intervals). The prediction horizon of 12 control intervals (one hour) is long enough to cover the response period of indoor conditions (e.g., the time for indoor temperature to be cooled down to the setpoint from initial conditions in the morning is usually less than one hour) and the control interval of 5 min is also fine enough to capture the dynamic response of indoor conditions. The linearized building model and the constraints of the MPC are linear whereas the objective function (Equation (1)) is quadratic. The optimization problem of the ML-based MPC with IL is a typical quadratic programming problem. Hence, the quadratic programming (QP) algorithm [32] is employed for solving the optimization problem in the ML-based MPC with IL. 2.5 ML-based building model and linearization To capture the time-dependant nature of building dynamics, a recurrent neural network (RNN) with nonlinear autoregressive exogenous (NARX) architecture, suitable for time-series prediction [33], is employed in this study. The NARX RNN is based on a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) ANN with time-delayed inputs and feedback of outputs as shown in Fig. 5 . The NARX RNN is a nonlinear dynamic model, which could be written as, (2) y t = f y t - 1 , y t - 2 ⋯ y t - n d , y , u t - 1 , u t - 2 ⋯ u t - n d , u , where y, f(), u, t and n refer to output, function, input, time and number. Subscript d refers to time delay. For the office, the cooling power (Qclg ) of FCU and the CO2 concentration in return air (Cra ) are used as inputs to predict indoor PMV. Qclg is the MV and Cra is the MD in the MPC controller. Heat gain from the adjacent rooms should be small as the adjacent rooms are also air-conditioned. Hence, heat gain from the adjacent rooms is considered as an unmeasured disturbance. As the office is located in the basement of the building without direct exposure to the outdoor environment, weather conditions are not considered as disturbances. However, for buildings that are exposed to the outdoors, weather conditions including air temperature, humidity and solar irradiance shall be included in the inputs of the RNN model and MDs of MPC for the implementation of the proposed ML-based MPC system. Heat loads from equipment and lighting in the office are assumed to be constant during office hours, hence, are excluded from the inputs. Occupancy load is represented by the CO2 concentration in the return air. Considering that the occupancy load in the office environment is rather stable, the MD (CO2 concentration in the return air) is assumed to be constant in the prediction horizon, i.e., the currently measured MD value is applied to all the 12 control intervals across the prediction horizon. The inputs and outputs of the NARX RNN are summarized in Table 2. The input variable, Qclg, is used in the cooling energy consumption term and the output variable, PMV, is used in the thermal discomfort term of the objective function (Equation (1)). The selection of inputs and outputs for the NARX RNN model as well as the MDs, MVs and MOs for the MPC in different buildings is discussed in Section 4.3. Two-week-long historical building operation data, including the inputs and outputs of the NARX RNN model as listed in Table 2, were collected when the office ACMV system was controlled by its original thermostat for training an initial NARX RNN model. The data were collected by an I/O system (ADVANTECH, ADAM-4019&4024) at 5-second intervals and stored in a server at 1-min interval. Data points are randomly picked up from the data set to put into three sub-sets, i.e., 70% for model training, 15% for model validation and the remaining 15% for model testing. The NARX RNN model is trained using Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm in MATLAB deep learning toolbox [34]. The model training is based on an error function of the mean squared error (MSE) of the predicted indoor PMV against measurement. The maximum number of epochs is set at 1000 iterations, which is large enough for the model training to reach convergence where MSE does not reduce further. The CPU processing time to train the NARX RNN (including model training, validation and testing) using the two-week-long historical building operation data in a laptop with Intel Core i7-7920HQ CPU and 64 GB RAM is within 2\u201310 s. The hidden layer size of five neurons was selected based on a \u2018trial-and-error\u2019 method detailed in a previous study [35]. Briefly, a sequence of trials of RNN training was conducted with incremental hidden layer size starting from one neuron until the training error cannot be further reduced by further increasing the layer size. The final RNN was then used as the initial building model. The R-values of the initial building model in the training, validation and test stages are 0.975, 0.974 and 0.977, respectively. The building model will be further updated using real-time building operation data when the MPC is controlling the office as described in Section 2.3. The NARX RNN model described in Equation (2) is nonlinear, meaning that it would require high computational power and long computing time to solve, causing problems for real-time control. To address this problem, it is proposed to linearize Equation (2) by introducing a state vector, x, such that (3) x t = y t - 1 , y t - 2 ⋯ y t - n d , y , u t - 1 , u t - 2 ⋯ u t - n d , u . For a time step t, Equation (2) could be linearized around the measured current state (x(t)) using Taylor expansion to predict the output at time step (t + 1), (4) y t + 1 ≅ f x t + ∑ i = 1 n y c y , i y t - i + 1 - y t - i + ∑ i = 1 n u c u , i u t - i + 1 - u t - i , where c u , i = ∂ f ( x ( t ) ) ∂ u ( t - i ) , c y , i = ∂ f ( x ( t ) ) ∂ y ( t - i ) . Equation (4) is a linear approximation of the nonlinear NARX RNN model (Equation (2)) for time step t. The linear approximation is used, instead of the nonlinear NARX RNN model, to formulate a linear MPC for the optimization for the next time step. This model linearization is repeated at each time step (control interval of MPC). 3 Experiments 3.1 Experiment arrangement Three test cases, as listed in Table 3 , using different controls for the chilled water valve of the FCU were conducted during April \u2013 May 2020. Each case ran for 5 workdays, from 9 am to 6 pm on each workday. Besides the cases of Thermostat and the ML-based MPC with IL, another case was run with a ML-based MPC system that directly uses the ML-based building model (without model linearization module) developed in a previous study [36] to provide another comparison reference for evaluating the performance of the ML-based MPC system with IL proposed in this study. A hybrid optimization algorithm developed in the previous study [36] is employed to solve the nonconvex optimization problem of the ML-based MPC system (without IL). The hybrid optimization algorithm consists of a global optimizer (exhaustive search method) and a gradient-based optimizer (subsequent quadratic programming). The global optimizer works as a primary optimizer to search for coarse global optimal solutions. The gradient-based optimizer, working as a secondary optimizer, takes the coarse global optimal solutions as initial guesses, followed by searching for the final optimal solutions. More details of the hybrid optimization algorithm can be found in [36]. Both the ML-based MPC system and the ML-based MPC system with IL share the same MPC controller configuration as described in Section 2.4. Both the ML-based MPC system and the ML-based MPC system with IL are implemented in a laptop with Intel Core i7-7920HQ CPU and 64 GB RAM in the experiments. The configuration of the thermostat case is described in Section 2.2.1 whereas the configurations of the two MPC cases are described in Sections 2.3 and 2.4. The thermal comfort and energy efficiency performance of the three cases is evaluated using the measured indoor PMV and measured cooling energy of the FCU, respectively. Statistical distributions of measured CO2 concentration in the return air for the three test cases are shown in Fig. 6 . The average CO2 concentrations of Thermostat, ML-based MPC and ML-based MPC with IL cases are 757, 754 and 783, respectively. Compared to the Thermostat case, the discrepancy in the average CO2 concentration is 0.4% for the ML-based MPC and 3.4% for the ML-based MPC with IL case. This gives an indication of the repeatability of the internal occupancy load in the three cases. As the office is in the basement without direct exposure to the outdoor environment, weather conditions are not considered as disturbances to the office. 3.2 Experimental results 3.2.1 Results analysis of one day Fig. 7 shows the time series of measured a) indoor PMV, b) room air temperature and c) cooling power of one day (day 5 of each case). The time series of measured indoor PMV, room air temperature and cooling power of the rest of the test days are shown in Fig. A1 - Fig. A3. Fig. 7 (a) shows that the thermostat tends to overcool the office by keeping indoor PMV below the thermal neutrality (PMV = 0) throughout the day. In contrast, the two MPC maintained indoor PMV close to thermal neutrality throughout the day due to the model-based optimization to minimize thermal discomfort (Equation (1)). The indoor PMV varied much more in the thermostat case, compared to the MPC cases, due to the reactive nature of the thermostat control. With the model-based prediction and optimization capacities, the two MPC cases maintained the indoor PMV much more stably than the thermostat case did. The results suggest that the two MPC can achieve much better indoor thermal comfort performance than the thermostat and the ML-based MPC with IL can achieve comparable thermal comfort performance as the ML-based MPC on the day. The time series of measured room air temperature and cooling power are shown in Fig. 7 (b) and (c). Fig. 7 (c) shows that the cooling power with the thermostat has large fluctuations at either minimum (0 kW) or maximum (around 20 kW) due to its reactive-based control, echoing the observations in Fig. 7 (a). ML-based MPC kept the cooling power around 6 kW most of the time, which made indoor PMV much more stable than the thermostat as shown in Fig. 7 (a). The stability of cooling power of ML-based MPC with IL is worse than ML-based MPC, resulting in less stable indoor PMV than ML-based MPC, but, still more stable indoor PMV than the thermostat. 3.2.2 Results analysis of the whole test period Fig. 8 shows the statistical distributions of the measured indoor PMV and room air temperature of the three cases. Fig. 8 (a) shows that the thermostat kept indoor PMV below the thermal neutrality at 96% of the time with a median value of −0.2, echoing the observations in Fig. 7 (a). Indoor PMV was even below the lower bound of the comfortable range (PMV = −0.5) at 1.5% of the time with the thermostat control, when the occupants had higher chance to feel cool. By contrast, the two MPC systems maintained indoor PMV close to thermal neutrality (median PMV of 0.01 for the ML-based MPC and 0 for the ML-based MPC with IL) and kept indoor PMV within the comfortable range (−0.5, 0.5) all the time. Indoor PMV shows a wide range with an interquartile range (IQR) of 0.19 in the thermostat case whereas the two MPC cases maintained indoor PMV within a much narrower IQR of 0.05. The results suggest that both the MPC systems achieved much better thermal comfort performance than the thermostat during the whole test period. Comparing the indoor PMV results between the two MPC cases, the ML-based MPC with IL case achieved similar median value and IQR of indoor PMV to that of the ML-based MPC case, suggesting that the ML-based MPC with IL can achieve comparable thermal comfort performance as the ML-based MPC. Fig. 8 (b) shows the statistical distributions of measured room air temperature of three cases. The thermostat kept room air temperature in a wider range than the MPC cases, echoing with the observations in Fig. 8 (a). The median value of room air temperature with the thermostat control is 23.6 °C according to the set point temperature in the thermostat set by occupants. The two MPC both kept room air temperature around 24.2 °C, which is the outcome of MPC optimization (Equation (1)) to minimize thermal discomfort and cooling energy consumption. Fig. 9 shows the energy performance comparison between the three cases. Fig. 9 (a) shows the statistical distributions of the measured cooling power of the FCU. The thermostat has a much higher mean cooling power than the two MPC cases. The thermostat also has a much larger IQR of cooling power than the MPC cases, which echoes with the larger IQR of indoor PMV distribution of the thermostat control, as observed in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8. Fig. 9 (b) shows the average daily cooling energy consumed by the FCU of the three cases. The thermostat case consumed the highest cooling energy among the three cases at 100.3 kWh per day. The cooling energy consumption is significantly reduced to 68.6 kWh per day by the ML-based MPC and to 74.2 kWh per day by the ML-based MPC with IL. The cooling energy savings by the ML-based MPC system and the ML-based MPC with IL system compared to the thermostat are 31.6% and 26.0%, respectively. The energy savings are mainly derived from the model-based optimization described by Equation (1) in MPC. The thermal comfort optimization (second term on the right side of Equation (1)) of MPC is based on indoor PMV predictions by the ML-based building model, which considers multiple factors (room air temperature, humidity, mean radiant temperature, air velocity as well as occupant\u2019s clothing level and metabolic rate) instead of just room air temperature in the thermostat. Thus, MPC can take advantage of comprehensive knowledge of thermal comfort to allow for a higher room air temperature as long as the PMV is maintained near the thermal neutrality, enabling MPC to achieve energy savings over the thermostat. However, it is based on the assumption that the PMV can truly represent the occupants\u2019 thermal comfort. The assumed parameters (clothing level, air velocity, and metabolic rate) of PMV described in Section 2.2.2 might lead to deviation of measured PMV from the true thermal sensation of the occupant. The deviation might also contribute to the energy savings. More discussions on thermal comfort verification are in Section 5. Besides, due to the nature of reactive control, the thermostat kept indoor conditions with large fluctuations, which caused overcooling of indoor conditions (especially in the morning) as shown in Fig. 7. In contrast, MPC maintained indoor conditions in a much more stable way that avoided overcooling, which is another factor of the energy savings achieved by MPC. The results suggest the ML-based MPC with IL can retain most of the energy-saving potential of the ML-based MPC. Combing with the thermal comfort results, it can be concluded that the ML-based MPC with IL does not obviously degrade MPC performance in terms of thermal comfort and energy saving, compared to the non-linear ML-based MPC. 4 Discussion 4.1 Benefits of IL for ML-based MPC New methods to largely cutting down the computation load of MPC is one of the most needed breakthroughs to enable widespread applications of MPC for building energy management. The high computation power required by MPC, especially for those employing nonlinear building models, has been one of the major technical barriers for its popularity. This study proposes a solution that incorporates an IL module into a ML-based MPC to linearize the nonlinear ML-based building models in real-time at each control interval. In the experimental test cases presented in this paper, the CPU took 15.64 s on average in a control interval to obtain the optimal control solution for the FCU for the ML-based MPC as shown in Fig. 10 . That time was largely consumed by solving the nonlinear optimization problem. The proposed ML-based MPC with IL largely reduced the CPU processing time to 0.22 s on average to obtain each optimal control solution, among which 0.03 s on average was consumed by solving the optimization problem and the remaining 0.19 s on average was consumed by model linearization. It shows that using IL could significantly reduce the computation load of ML-based MPC by more than 70 times. Due to the simplicity of the experimental test building used in the current study, which is a single zone office of 100 m2 in floor space, the ML-based MPC could obtain an optimal control solution in a time span (15.64 s on average) much shorter than the control interval of 5 min. However, for scaled-up applications, the time required to obtain an optimal solution could become longer than the control interval in ML-based MPC, limiting its applicability for real-time control for the following reasons: i. Scaled-up applications in common commercial buildings involve many zones and ACMV units. The CPU processing time for ML-based MPC might become much longer with the increased number of zones and ACMV units. To prove this point, two simulation cases were conducted with ML-based MPC and ML-based MPC with IL controlling a fictitious office building with 60 thermally-independent zones each served by an dedicated FCU, as described in Appendix B. The ML-based MPC took 755.70 s of CPU processing time to solve the nonlinear optimization problem and obtain the optimal solutions for all the FCUs in the entire fictitious building, which is much longer than the control interval (5 min). The long CPU processing time prohibits the ML-based MPC for real-time control of the fictitious building. In contrast, the ML-based MPC with IL only took 17.14 s of CPU processing time to obtain the optimal solutions for all the FCUs in the entire fictitious building, which is much shorter than the control interval. The simulations demonstrated that the ML-based MPC might not be applicable to perform real-time control in a full-building (or multi-zone) situation even though the building is equipped with a high-power BMS server similar to the one used in this study, due to the low computational efficiency of solving a non-linear building model and the optimization problem. The proposed ML-based MPC with IL provides a viable solution to such situations due to its much-improved computational efficiency. ii. Control systems for buildings in scaled-up applications also heavily rely on less powerful, low-cost control hardware (e.g., embedded controllers, programmable logic controllers (PLCs) and direct digital controllers (DDCs)) instead of how-power computing devices. Implementing the ML-based MPC using these low-cost control hardware would further lengthen the CPU processing time in obtaining the optimal solutions. Since the ML-based MPC with IL has essentially turned into a linear MPC controller, it opens the potential to be implemented in the low-cost control hardware for real-time building control, especially in microprocessor-based DDCs that are already widely used in buildings [37]). Linear MPC was successfully implemented for real-time control in low-cost, microprocessor-based control hardware in previous studies [3839]. In contrast, it is highly challenging to implement nonlinear MPC (e.g., ML-based MPC) using those low-cost control hardware due to the computational complexity [40]. Despite the fact that IL caused some minor degradation in control performance in terms of thermal comfort and energy saving, the control performance of ML-based MPC with IL is still much better than the conventional thermostat. 4.2 Effect of IL on model prediction performance The effect of IL on the performance of model prediction is further analyzed in Fig. 11 . The figure shows the distributions of absolute errors between the predicted indoor PMV and the measured indoor PMV by the two models (ML-based building model and ML-based building model with IL) for the MPC cases. It shows that ML-based building model with IL has the same median, mean, 25-percentile and minimum absolute errors as the ML-based building model. Only the 75-percentile and maximum absolute errors of the ML-based building model with IL are slightly different. It suggests that adding IL does not degrade the model prediction performance in any tangible manna. This echoes with the observation discussed in Section 3.2 that ML-based MPC with IL can achieve comparable control performance with the ML-based MPC. 4.3 Applicability to different types of buildings Although this study only demonstrated the implementation and effectiveness of the proposed ML-based MPC with IL in a basement office that does not expose to the outdoor environment, ML-based MPC with IL is applicable to wider types of buildings with some modifications. Normal buildings are exposed to the outdoor environment and, thus, are subject to transient weather conditions, including air temperature, humidity and solar irradiance. In order to implement ML-based MPC with IL for these buildings, weather conditions should be included in the inputs of the ML-based building model and the measured disturbances of MPC. For buildings having highly transient internal heat loads (e.g., occupancy, equipment and lighting), these heat loads should also be included in the inputs of the ML-based building model and the measured disturbances of MPC. These amendments will enable MPC to take the effect of transient weather conditions and internal loads on building responses into consideration such that the MPC can predict building responses more precisely for optimizing building energy efficiency and human comfort. For instance, a ML-based MPC controller was experimentally implemented to control an ACMV system in a lecture theatre, which is exposed to outdoor environment and has highly dynamic internal loads, in the previous study [36]. The ML-based building model of the MPC included the weather conditions and the highly dynamic internal loads in its inputs and the MPC achieved 36% of energy saving and improved thermal comfort as compared to conventional reactive control. ML-based MPC with IL shares the similar applicability as ML-based MPC since the proposed IL does not affect the MPC formulation. Normal buildings, especially commercial buildings, often consist of multiple zones. The proposed ML-based MPC with IL can achieve multi-zone control by adopting the decentralized MPC framework [41] as shown in Fig. 12 , for scaled-up implementations in multi-zone buildings. The decentralized MPC framework consists of multiple MPC controllers and each MPC controller only controls its dedicated zone without interfacing with other MPC controllers. Hence, for a building with multiple zones, an individual ML-based MPC with IL controller needs to be developed for each zone following the same method described in this study. The simulation-based implementation of the ML-based MPC with IL for a fictitious multi-zone building is demonstrated and described in Appendix B. For buildings equipped with heating systems, the heating power should be added in the inputs of the ML-based building model and the manipulated variables, objective function as well as constraints of MPC. For buildings that require to optimize particular room conditions (e.g., room air temperature, humidity) besides indoor PMV (e.g., special hospital wards, indoor farming, fabrication rooms), these room conditions should also be added in the outputs of the ML-based building model and the manipulated variables, objective function as well as constraints of MPC. For buildings with faster/slower responses, the control interval and prediction should be shortened/increased so that building responses can be captured in the optimization of MPC. 5 Limitations There are a few limitations in this study, which provide indications on further improvements needed in future works. In the current experiments, the PMV index is employed to evaluate the occupant\u2019s thermal comfort, where some assumed values (clothing level, air velocity, and metabolic rate) are used as the inputs for the PMV index. The assumed values might lead to deviation of measured PMV from the true thermal sensation of the occupants. A more vigorous approach for the verification of occupant comfort (e.g., wearable sensors or questionnaire survey) shall be considered in future studies. However, a manual selector was installed in the office in this study, as shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 13 , which allowed the occupants to switch the FCU control back to the original thermostat case if they felt uncomfortable during the MPC tests. The switch was never triggered by the occupants due to discomfort caused by MPC control. For the whole test period, the switch was only triggered once due to a communication failure between the MPC controller and the control panel occurred. It provided an indication that the MPC can maintain acceptable thermal comfort for the occupants during the tests. The MPC system developed in the current study was based on a single zone office and was running on a computer that has much higher computational power than typical building system controllers. The outcome of the current study could only be considered as a proof-of-concept for the proposed ML-based MPC with IL. The effectiveness of such concept in overcoming the limitations in CPU processing time and computational power in real building settings will need to be further proven in a full-size building using typical low-power control hardware. 6 Conclusion This paper proposes a machine-learning-based model predictive control with instantaneous linearization for building energy management. The key feature of the developed model predictive control is the instantaneous linearization scheme that can recurrently linearize the nonlinear machine-learning-based building model at each control interval using real-time measured building operation data. With instantaneous linearization, the computation load of machine-learning-based model predictive control is significantly reduced as the optimization problem is converted from a nonconvex one to a convex one. Meanwhile, the linearized building model retains the high prediction accuracy of the original nonlinear machine-learning model since the linearized model is being updated at each control interval. The proposed MPC system is implemented to control an air-conditioning system in an office in Singapore for experimental evaluation of its control performance as well as comparison with a machine-learning-based model predictive control that employs a nonlinear machine-learning-based building model directly as well as the original reactive-control-based thermostat. The proposed model predictive control with instantaneous linearization and the other model predictive control without linearization achieved 26% and 31.6% cooling energy savings, respectively, as compared to the thermostat. Meanwhile, both the model predictive control systems significantly improved indoor thermal comfort for the office, as compared to the original thermostat. The results suggest that using instantaneous linearization for machine-learning-based model predictive control could substantially reduce the computation load with no obvious performance degradation in terms of thermal comfort and energy saving. This could enhance the adaptability of machine-learning-based model predictive control for building energy management.

Appendix A Fig. A1 , Fig. A2 , Fig. A3 and Fig. A4 . Appendix B A simulation model of a fictitious building consisting of 60 zones, with each zone having the same dimensions, construction, heat loads and ACMV system as the office described in Section 2.2, was developed in MATLAB. For the fictitious building, it is assumed that all the zones are independent in terms of thermodynamics and air-conditioning, i.e., there is no thermal interaction between different zones and each zone is only air conditioned by its dedicated FCU. The total floor area of the building is 6000 m2 (each zone is 100 m2), representing a typical middle-size (5000\u201315,000 m2 of total floor area [42]) office building. Two simulation cases including a case using ML-based MPC and another case using ML-based MPC with IL were conducted. The ML-based MPC/ML-based MPC with IL systems were the same as that used in the experiments described in Section 3.1. The same NARX RNN described in Section 2.5 was employed as the virtual testbed for each zone. Both cases were based on a decentralized control framework, as shown in Fig. 12. Since the zones in the fictitious building are assumed independent from each other thermally, the control of each zone is also independent, i.e., the MPC controller of each zone does not need to consider thermodynamics of other zones and there is no higher-level controller to coordinate the control of multiple zones. Fig. A4 shows the simulation framework. The disturbance (CO2 concentration in return air) measured on a day of the experiments was used for the simulations. The simulation time period of each case is one hour just for evaluating CPU processing time purpose. The simulations were conducted on the same computer as described in Section 3.1. In the simulation case of ML-based MPC, the CPU took 755.70 s on average in a control interval to solve the nonlinear optimization problem to obtain the optimal control solutions for the FCUs of the entire building. The time taken is much longer than the control interval of 300 s, hence, the ML-based MPC is not suitable for real-time control of the fictitious building. In the simulation case of ML-based MPC with IL, the average CPU time taken to obtain the optimal control solutions for the FCUs of the entire building was reduced to 17.14 s, among which 2.24 s was consumed by solving the linear optimization problem and the remaining 14.90 s was consumed by model linearization. The ML-based MPC with IL managed to keep the CPU time much shorter than the control interval, meaning that the ML-based MPC with IL system can perform real-time control for the entire building.

        "dc:description": "Machine-learning (ML) \u2013based building models have been gaining popularity in constructing model predictive control (MPC) for building energy management applications. However, ML-based building models are usually nonlinear so to capture the building dynamics, leading to high computation load for MPC, prohibiting its application for real-time building control. This study proposes a ML-based MPC with an instantaneous linearization (IL) scheme, which employs real-time building operation data to linearize the nonlinear ML-based building model for constructing a linear MPC at each control interval. The proposed ML-based MPC with IL system is implemented to control an air conditioning system in an office of a general hospital building located in Singapore for experimental evaluation of its control performance. The ML-based MPC with IL is compared to a ML-based MPC that directly uses a nonlinear ML-based building model and the original reactive-control-based thermostat of the office. Results show that the ML-based MPC with IL significantly reduced the computation time (by more than 70 times) as compared to the ML-based MPC while retained most of the advantages of the ML-based MPC. The ML-based MPC with IL and the ML-based MPC achieved 31.6% and 26.0% reductions, respectively, in cooling energy consumption as compared to the original thermostat. Meanwhile, both the MPC systems significantly improved indoor thermal comfort for the office as compared to the original thermostat. The study demonstrated that using IL for ML-based MPC could substantially improve computation efficiency with no obvious performance degradation in terms of thermal comfort and energy saving.",
