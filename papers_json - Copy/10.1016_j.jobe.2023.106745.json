This paper presents a novel, model-based approach for energy-focused indoor particulate matter (PM) concentration control and indoor temperature management for a residential house. A physics-based model is developed to predict PM concentration and temperature indoors as a function of outdoor PM concentration, outdoor temperature, indoor emission, indoor heat generation, and flow rates of air handling unit (AHU), portable air filter (PAF), and air conditioning (AC) systems. The optimized settings of the ventilation systems AHU, PAF, and AC are determined employing a nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) algorithm. A case study in Delhi, one of the most polluted cities in the world, is conducted. Extensive simulation studies under seasonal changes in outdoor conditions and varying indoor emissions demonstrate the ability of the MPC controller to maintain PM concentration and temperature indoors within or close to the desired levels, while optimizing energy consumption. Keywords Indoor air quality Thermal comfort Nonlinear model predictive control Optimization Energy Data availability Data will be made available on request. 1 Introduction Particulate matter (PM) pollution is a major challenge of the 21st century with wide consequences for human health and economy [1,2]. PM is typically categorized into three types based on the approximate diameter of the particles: PM10 (aerodynamic diameter < 10 μ m ), PM2.5 (aerodynamic diameter < 2 . 5 μ m ), and PM0.1 (aerodynamic diameter < 0 . 1 μ m ). Although exposure to any PM type results in a broad range of health effects, PM2.5 has been associated with significant health risks. Previous studies have reported that long term exposure to PM2.5 causes cardiopulmonary mortality among adults and deficits in lung growth and respiratory illness among children [3\u20136]. Also, of all other pollutants such as carbon monoxide, ozone, and nitrogen dioxide, PM2.5 exceeds the desirable threshold by a huge margin, especially in Indian cities. Therefore, most studies reported in the literature focus on PM2.5, when estimating air quality [7\u201311]. This study focuses on PM2.5 pollutant concentration prediction and control for indoor air quality (IAQ) and will simply be referred to as \u2018PM\u2019 from here onward. While the cause for concern exists in both developing and developed countries, India, in particular, faces a huge challenge. 63 cities of the country have been listed among the world\u2019s top 100 worst polluted cities in a recent report [12]. Delhi, the capital city, has been the world\u2019s most polluted metropolis (with a population of more than 20 million) for the past several years [12]. Moreover, in Delhi, PM concentrations show strong seasonal variations. During summer, PM concentrations remain close to the desired levels prescribed by the World Health Organization (WHO). However, during winter, PM concentrations usually exceed the desired levels by more than 10 times [13]. This variation adds to the complexity of heuristic-based decision making for IAQ control. Many studies on developing automated, advanced control systems for IAQ have been reported in the literature. Ventilation, either mechanical or natural, was used as the manipulable mechanism in many of the studies. In Delhi, and during winter, as the outdoor PM concentrations are extremely high, ventilation with the outdoors alone may not be sufficient to achieve desired IAQ [10]. Several studies have also examined the impact of using central heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, with inbuilt filters, and external devices such as portable air filters (PAFs) on IAQ. An experimental study reported that usage of central HVAC systems alone could reduce indoor PM concentration by 25%\u201350%, while PAFs can reduce the concentration by 55%\u201385% [14]. A significant reduction in indoor PM concentrations, in the presence of both outdoor and indoor sources, was observed by using high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters [15]. A few studies have also been carried out to determine the advantages of PAFs in Delhi. Vyas et al. [8] conducted an experimental study in a residential apartment in the city during the winter of 2015\u20132016. Although no controller was implemented in their study, substantial reduction in indoor PM concentration was observed when PAF was used continuously throughout the day. A simulation study by Liao et al. [10] on operation of air purifiers with various filtration efficiencies and schedules also reported significant improvement in IAQ with air filter usage in a typical household setting in Delhi. The limitations of the study include the approximation of indoor pollutant sources, such as cooking and smoking, as being uniformly distributed throughout the day and the heuristic-based controller design. While the majority of the studies in literature on IAQ control have been carried out in cities with relatively low PM concentrations outdoors [9,16,17], studies on automated IAQ control on cities with high outdoor pollution concentrations, such as Delhi, is limited. Several studies on cities with high outdoor PM concentrations focused on analyzing patterns, identifying the contributing factors, and framing policies, with the aim to reduce pollutant concentrations [18]. On the other hand, studies related to automated control of indoor PM concentrations considered mainly the HVAC systems, with inbuilt filtration systems, as actuators [8,14]. In the past decade, HEPA grade filters have gained attention as auxiliary devices to reduce PM concentration indoors [15]. Nevertheless, heuristic control, employing such devices, does not guarantee the best achievable performance [10]. With advancements in computational power of modern computers and multivariable optimal control algorithms, automatic control including auxiliary devices can be performed to achieve optimal operational performance, which is the main goal of this work. In addition to outdoor sources, indoor activities, such as cooking, smoking, operating appliances, etc., contribute to the pollution indoors [19]. Among many such indoor PM sources, cooking, smoking, candle burning, and cat litter were reported as the few of the major contributors in previous studies [9,14]. Most of these studies, however, were carried out in western setting with different socially-driven behaviors compared to India. For instance, in India, cooking is one of the major indoor activities since the majority of Indians cook daily at home [20]. Also, cooking duration in India is generally longer than in western countries [21]. This aspect is accounted for in this work while simulating indoor conditions. While IAQ is necessary for human health, thermal comfort (TC) has been identified as one of the most important aspects for occupant satisfaction [22]. Collectively, IAQ and TC are regarded as two most important requirements for comfortable environment indoors [23,24]. TC is conventionally obtained by regulating indoor air temperature by means of HVAC systems [25]. A tropical country like India has very little demand for heating systems and residential apartments in the country typically employ unitary air conditioning (AC) systems (split or window) to cool indoor air. These systems are energy intensive and the energy demand of AC systems alone in India is expected to increase by 15 times, from 90 TeraWatt-hour (TWh) in 2016 to 1350 TWh in 2050 [26]. Further, residential buildings (which are the third largest consumer of electricity in the country) are projected to increase in terms of floor area from 3.5 billion m 2 to 7.0 billion m 2 , leading to huge increase in energy demand [27]. Although passive strategies to modify building envelopes can result in energy efficiency improvement [28\u201330], factors such as building occupancy behavior and real-time changes in ambient conditions make control automation solutions necessary for TC. Many studies have been performed with the objective of maintaining TC in buildings by varying the ventilation rates of HVAC systems using model-based analysis and predictive control [31\u201335]. Achieving desired IAQ and TC with an overall objective of energy minimization is a multivariable, optimized control problem. Ventilation systems to regulate IAQ also affect TC since air from outdoors at a different temperature flow into the buildings through inlet channels, the flow rates of which are determined by these systems. In addition to the above, current AC systems have inbuilt air filter which also help reduce the pollutant concentrations indoors. As the usage of PAFs and ACs is increasing in India [36], a model-based optimized control for TC, IAQ and energy minimization is necessary. The novel contribution of this work lies in developing such a controller that manipulates the flow rates of air handling unit (AHU), PAF, and AC systems to minimize energy consumption without compromising TC and IAQ indoors, especially for Delhi, a city with high pollution concentration outdoors. Model predictive control (MPC) is the most widespread, model-based, optimized control strategy for multivariable, constrained systems, such as buildings [9,32,33,37]. MPC uses a mathematical model of a system under consideration to predict its future behavior and determines control inputs to drive the future output values in a desired manner [38]. Being a model-based algorithm, the controller performance depends on the accuracy of the model. In general, building models to predict pollutant concentrations and temperature indoors as a function of outdoor conditions, indoor emissions, and ventilator settings, are nonlinear due to the underlying heat and mass transfer mechanisms. Most MPC implementation strategies consider a linearized (around a steady-state operating point) version of the detailed nonlinear model, usually with a bias correction-factor, for computationally-efficient control inputs calculation. This approach might yield reasonable control performance under low variation in outdoor temperature and PM concentrations. However, in Delhi, outdoor PM concentrations can exceed 800 μ g/m 3 in November and remain within 40 μ g/m 3 in August. Hence, under such high variation, linearization of the model around any operating point would introduce significant errors in prediction, thereby also in optimized control input calculations. Moreover, for large-scale systems, such as chemical processes, linearization is essential to keep computational costs within acceptable limits. However, for the building system considered in this work, a nonlinear, medium-scale, equation-oriented model is developed to balance computational costs with the ability to capture the underlying physical phenomena. The nonlinear model is discretized using orthogonal collocation on finite elements method and being medium-scale, used directly to develop a more accurate, nonlinear MPC controller for building TC and IAQ management. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. First, a dynamic, nonlinear building model to predict indoor temperature and PM concentrations as a function of outdoor conditions and indoor emissions is developed and presented in Section 2. Following, a brief description of the MPC strategy using orthogonal collocation on finite elements method is provided in Section 3. Next, the outdoor conditions and indoor emission rates for a case study in Delhi is presented in Section 4 and the closed-loop simulations results under MPC are presented in Section 5. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section 6. 2 System description and model development The system considered in this work is a typical residential house in Delhi with dimensions 9 m × 9 m × 3 m as shown in Fig. 1. A mechanical ventilation is provided by an AHU which controls the flow rate of outdoor air into the house. An AC unit maintains the temperature close to a predetermined set point. A PAF, an external device, further reduces PM concentrations indoors. Note that the AHU and AC units are also equipped with filters which help reduce PM concentration indoors. A dynamic model of the system is developed to balance computational costs with the ability to capture the underlying complex physics. The model helps evaluate the effects of ventilation systems and external device in maintaining IAQ and TC. In practice, temperature (or pollutant) measurements are taken only at one location in a small-to-medium-sized or single-zone house. Hence, for modeling purposes, the house is assumed to be well-mixed, i.e., there are no spatial variation in both temperature and pollution concentration indoors. The outdoor PM concentration, outdoor temperature, indoor PM generation rate, and indoor heat generation rate vary with time. Also, infiltration and exfiltration rates at which air leakages happen into or from the house are assumed to be constant [16]. The objective of the work is to develop a model-based predictive control strategy to maintain IAQ and TC by manipulating the flow rates of AHU, PAF and AC units. 2.1 Mass balance for pollutant concentration Indoor PM concentrations can be quantitatively measured using two approaches: direct or indirect. Direct approach involves deployment of sensors to measure indoor PM concentrations. This approach, although capable of providing accurate estimates of PM concentrations, is not suited for control studies. Nevertheless, it can be used to provide sensory feedback to the control system [39,40]. On the other hand, indirect approach involves the use of mass balance models or the computational fluid dynamic (CFD) models to quantitatively estimate indoor PM concentrations [41]. The parameters of the models are estimated from experimental data via the direct approach. Mass balance models are relatively simple in providing temporal changes for PM concentration indoors. They can provide reasonably accurate estimates for a single-zone house under the well-mixed assumption. CFD models, on the other hand, are particularly useful to model multizone effects as they are capable of providing spatio-temporal changes. In CFD, the Navier\u2013Stokes equations are solved numerically employing discretization strategies. This approach is typically taken for studies on multizone analysis or in assessment studies wherein the distribution of indoor air contaminants, such as formaldehyde and CO 2 concentrations and distribution of temperature are studied [42\u201344]. However, the detailed results are obtained at the expense of high computational costs and hence CFD is not ideal for optimized control applications [40,43]. In this work, a mass balance model is developed to balance computational costs with the ability to predict PM concentration and temperature indoors. The various factors which can affect indoor PM concentration are the infiltration/exfiltration rates, ventilation systems, surface deposition, and filtration provided by auxiliary devices such as PAFs or ACs. The mass balance can be expressed mathematically as: (1) d C i n d t = P λ C o u t − λ C i n + G V + ( 1 − η A H U ) Q A H U V C o u t − Q A H U V C i n − k d C i n − η P A F Q P A F V C i n − η A C Q A C V C i n where, P is the penetration factor, λ is the infiltration (or exfiltration) rate, C o u t is the pollutant concentration outdoors, G is the PM emission rate indoors, η A H U is the particle removal efficiency of the ventilation system, η P A F is the particle removal efficiency of the filtration system, η A C is the particle removal efficiency of the AC, V is the volume of the house, Q A H U is the ventilation flow rate, Q P A F is the filtration flow rate, Q A C is the AC flow rate, and k d is the particle deposition rate. The first two terms of Eq. (1) represent the flow of PM into and out of the house due to infiltration and exfiltration, respectively. The penetration factor, P , is the fraction of outdoor PM penetrating indoors due to infiltration. The third term represents the increase in PM concentration indoors due to emission indoors. The fourth and fifth terms represent the increase and decrease in PM concentration indoors due to air flowing in through the AHU and air flowing out through the outlet channel, respectively. The rest of the terms represent the decrease in PM concentration indoors due to deposition onto surfaces, filtration by PAF, and filtration by AC, respectively. 2.2 Energy balance for temperature Thermal comfort can be defined as \u201cthe condition which expresses satisfaction with the thermal environment\u201d [45]. It is subjective and can be ensured by controlling the temperature of the air indoors. Similar to the model for PM concentration indoors, energy balance models or CFD-based models can be developed to predict temperature indoors. Energy balance models are relatively simple or computationally inexpensive and can predict indoor temperature with reasonable accuracy. The various factors which can affect the temperature indoors are the heat generation from occupant presence or activities indoors, heat gain or loss when air flows in or out through the inlet or outlet channel, by infiltration, or by ex-filtration, volume of the house, and heat transfer to the surroundings through the wall. The energy balance equation can be expressed mathematically as: (2) ρ a i r c p , a i r V d T i n d t = ρ a i r c p , a i r ( V λ + Q A H U ) ( T o u t − T i n ) − ρ a i r c p , a i r Q A C ( T i n − T c ) − h a i r A w a l l ( T i n − T w ) + q ̇ g e n where, ρ a i r is the density of air, c p , a i r is the specific heat capacity of air, T o u t is the temperature outdoors, T i n is the temperature indoors, T c is the temperature of air from the AC, T w is the inside wall surface temperature, h a i r is the heat transfer coefficient of air, q ̇ g e n is the net heat generated indoors. The first term of Eq. (2) represents the accumulation of heat indoors due to infiltration and air flow through the inlet channel connected to the AHU. The second and third terms represent heat loss from the house due to the cold air from AC and wall conduction to the ambient air, respectively. The last term represents the rate of heat generation from indoor activities, which can be expressed as: (3) q ̇ g e n = ∑ l = 1 N g e n P r , l h a i r A l ( T l − T i n ) where, N g e n is the number of heat generating surfaces (of equipment, appliances, or human skin), A l and T l are the surface area and surface temperature of the heat generating body l , respectively, and P r , l is the binary variable that represents the presence or absence of heat generation for surface l (or the on or off operation modes of an appliance). 2.2.1 Heat loss through the wall The energy balance equation (Eq. (2)) does not account for the heat transfer through the walls to the ambient air. This is considered by calculating T w from Eq. (2) and using it as a boundary condition for the one-dimensional, unsteady-state heat equation. Several studies reported in the literature have used a resistance\u2013capacitance (RC) network analog model for the wall to predict the outside wall temperature and account for heat transfer through the wall [32,33]. In this model, the walls of the house are modeled as a thermal network of analog circuit with equivalent capacitance and resistance elements. The model is simple enough to be implemented for control purposes and also accurate enough to capture the underlying dynamics of the process. The RC network analog of the heat transfer through wall is presented in Fig. 2. The temperature of the nodes in the RC network are governed by the following differential equations: (4) d T w o d t = T o u t − T w o R o C o + T w − T w o R w C o (5) d T w d t = T i n − T w R i C i + T w o − T w R w C i where, R w is the thermal resistance for conduction, C i and C o are the thermal capacitances of the inside and outside half of wall, respectively, R i and R o are the thermal resistances due to convection of the air indoors and outdoors, respectively, and T w o and T w are the outside and inside wall temperatures, respectively. The resistance and capacitance values can be calculated by: (6) R w = L k w a l l A w a l l (7) R o = R i = 1 h a i r A w a l l (8) C o = C i = ρ w a l l L A w a l l c p , w a l l 2 where, L is the thickness of the wall, A w a l l is the cross-sectional area of the wall, ρ w a l l is the density of the wall, and c p , w a l l is the heat capacity of the wall. 3 Model predictive control MPC is an advanced control strategy that utilizes a model of the system to predict its future behavior over a finite horizon and determines the optimal control inputs to drive the predicted future trajectory close to a reference (or desired) trajectory. This is realized by solving an optimal control problem (OCP) at each time instant. The OCP can be formulated based on the overall control objective of set point tracking or regulation along with imposition of any operational constraints. Once the OCP is solved, the first control input is injected into the system and the process is repeated again at the next time instant [38]. The overall model of the system can be developed by gathering the Eqs. (1)\u2013(2) and (4)\u2013(5) into the following form: (9) x ̇ = f ( x , Q A H U , Q P A F , Q A C , T o u t , C o u t , G , P r , l , t ) (10) y = C x where, x = T w o T w T i n C i n T is the state vector, y is the output vector, and C = 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 is the output matrix. The objective of this study is to control the flow rates of AHU, PAF, and AC to maintain TC and IAQ for different values of outdoor PM, outdoor temperature, indoor PM emission and indoor heat generation. The total energy consumption of AHU, PAF, and AC is the cost function. The OCP to be solved at any time step k is: (11a) min U ∑ j = 0 N − 1 { ρ 1 Q A H U , k + j 2 + ρ 2 Q P A F , k + j 2 + ρ 3 Q A C , k + j 2 + ρ 4 ϵ 1 , k + j 2 + ρ 5 ϵ 2 , k + j 2 + ρ 6 ϵ 3 , k + j 2 } (11b) subject to x ̇ = f ( x , Q A H U , Q P A F , Q A C , T o u t , C o u t , G , P r , l , t ) (11c) y = C x (11d) 0 ≤ C i n , k + j ≤ C T h + ϵ 1 , k + j (11e) T m i n − ϵ 2 , k + j ≤ T i n , k + j ≤ T m a x + ϵ 3 , k + j (11f) Q m i n , A H U ≤ Q A H U , k + j ≤ Q m a x , A H U (11g) 0 ≤ Q A C , k + j ≤ Q m a x , A C (11h) 0 ≤ Q P A F , k + j ≤ Q m a x , P A F (11i) ϵ 1 , k + j , ϵ 2 , k + , ϵ 3 , k + j ≥ 0 ∀ j ∈ { 0 , 1 , 2 , \u2026 , N − 1 } where, U = [ Q A H U , k , Q P A F , k , Q A C , k , \u2026 , Q A H U , k + N − 1 , Q P A F , k + N − 1 , Q A C , k + N − 1 ] is the decision variable vector, C T h is the Indian standard limit for IAQ, T m i n and T m a x are the minimum and maximum limits, respectively, for thermal comfort, Q m i n and Q m a x are the minimum and maximum limits, respectively, for flowrates, ρ 1 , ρ 2 , a n d ρ 3 are the weights assigned to the manipulated variables, ϵ 1 , ϵ 2 , and ϵ 3 are the slack variables for constraints with ρ 4 , ρ 5 , and ρ 6 as their respective weights in the cost function. At any time step k , the OCP of the form (11) is solved to obtain the optimal control input vector [ Q A H U , k ∗ , Q P A F , k ∗ , Q A C , k ∗ , \u2026 , Q A H U , k + N − 1 ∗ , Q P A F , k + N − 1 ∗ , Q A C , k + N − 1 ∗ ] . The first control input sequence [ Q A H U , k ∗ , Q P A F , k ∗ , Q A C , k ∗ ] is applied to the system and the process is repeated again at the next time instant k + 1 using the new information of the system. In the building system, high PM concentration outdoors, high temperature outdoors, and indoor activities, such as cooking, can drive PM concentration and temperature indoors to exceed the desired levels. Hence, if hard constrains on output variables are placed in the OCP, then the optimization problem will become infeasible during the aforementioned situations. In order to allow the problem to remain feasible, soft constraints (see Eqs. (11d)\u2013(11e)) are imposed on indoor PM and temperature. Positive values for slack variables ϵ 1 , ϵ 2 , a n d ϵ 3 ensure that that the constraint Eqs. (11d)\u2013(11e) are satisfied at all times. To avoid excessively large values for the slack variables, they are penalized in the objective function, thereby ensuring no utilization of energy once the controlled variables are within the desired threshold values. 3.1 Orthogonal collocation on finite elements The first principles model to predict indoor PM concentration and temperature (Eqs. (9)\u2013(10)) is nonlinear in nature. As discussed in Section 1, for MPC, in general, linearized model around a steady-state operation point is used to obtain reasonable prediction of the future states at nominal computational expense and for the OCP. However, for the building system, particularly for the case study considered in this work (and described in the following section), the outdoor and indoor conditions change significantly with time and there is no steady-state operating condition. Moreover, the model is medium-scale or the number of variables and equations in the model are not high that if the nonlinear model is used directly for the MPC design, the computational expense would increase to prohibitive levels. Hence, in this work, to preserve the nonlinear nature of the system and develop a controller with good tracking ability, the first-principles, nonlinear model is used as is for the MPC controller design, and implemented in the GEKKO optimization suite [46,47]. GEKKO uses orthogonal collocation on finite elements method to discretize the nonlinear differential equations (Eqs. (9)\u2013(10)) into a set of algebraic equations and then uses them in the objective function and as constraints in the OCP. The orthogonal collocation method is described briefly below. 1. Each time interval [ j , j + 1 ] is considered as a single finite element and is divided into p collocation points, where the values of the state vector ( x in Eq. (9)) are determined. 2. The state vector is approximated by a polynomial of order p + 1 , (12) x ( t ) = α 0 + α 1 t + ⋯ + α K t p 3. Assuming that the derivatives of the states are related to the corresponding states and their initial values: (13) x ̇ 1 x ̇ 2 . . x ̇ p = M x 1 x 2 . . x p − x 0 x 0 . . x 0 the matrix M is determined by substituting Eq. (12) into Eq. (13). 4. Substituting the model equations (see Eq. (9)) into the aforementioned equation, an algebraic system of equations is derived whose solutions are the states at the collocation points. Using the solution of final point x ̇ p as the initial point for the next finite element, the process is continued. For more information on the orthogonal collocation method, the reader is recommended to refer [47,48]. 4 Case study: Delhi Delhi is one of the most polluted cities in the world. The city also exhibits high variation in pollutant concentrations and temperatures across seasons [13]. Hence, the city is chosen for a case study to evaluate the performance of the MPC controller for energy minimization, pollution control, and thermal satisfaction indoors. 4.1 Model inputs and parameters The building model parameters are listed in Table 1. The inputs to the building model are the outdoor PM concentration, outdoor temperature, indoor PM emission rate, and indoor heat generation rate at each simulation time step. For a specified flow rate for AHU, AC, and PAF, the model predicts the PM concentration and temperature indoors at each time step. 4.1.1 Outdoor conditions In this work, historical data for PM concentration outdoors are obtained from published sources for different seasons or representative months (January, May, August, and November) for the year 2019 , the earliest pre-COVID pandemic year. The PM data are available at 15 minutes time resolution, and hence the simulation time step is chosen as 15 minutes. The PM concentration data for each month are shown in Fig. 3(a) [49]. Any missing data with more than 2 time samples for a single day are discarded. The discontinuities in the PM concentration outdoors plot correspond to the discarded data. The day in each month which records the most unfavorable conditions in terms of PM concentrations, and in which there are no missing data, is chosen as the day for simulation for the respective month, which is highlighted in Fig. 3(a). The simulation time for a day starts at 0 hr at 12 : 00 AM and ends at 24 hr at 12 : 00 AM. As can be observed, the PM concentration outdoors vary significantly across the year, with concentrations reaching 800 μ g/m 3 in November and remaining near the desired levels of 40 μ g/m 3 in August. The data for the temperature outdoors are also obtained from published sources [50] and are down-sampled to match the simulation time step. They are plotted in Fig. 3(b). As can be seen, the temperatures exceed 310 K (or 37 ° C) in May and August and drops below 290 K (or 17 ° C) in November. 4.1.2 Indoor emissions The next set of inputs are the PM emission rate and heat generation rate indoors. While the outdoor PM concentrations and temperatures change with seasons, the indoor activities for a day more or less remain the same. Hence, in this work, the indoor activity profile and occupancy for a day are assumed to be the same throughout the year. The different indoor activities and their contribution to the PM emissions and heat generation are obtained from the literature and are listed in Table 2. Solid cooking fuel is not considered to be another source for indoor PM concentrations since a typical urban household in Delhi is being studied. In India, household with solid cooking fuels are common in rural settings, but in urban settings, AC\u2019s and PAF\u2019s are the typical control actuators. Also, Delhi is kerosene-free and 90% of households rely on Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) for cooking [51]. The net values of the indoor PM emission rates as a function of time are plotted in Fig. 4. The emission rates peak in the morning and evening during the cooking activities. There is also an increase in the rate at around 22 : 00 due to the smoking activity. The other events do not contribute significantly to the emission rate profiles. Heat generation rates calculated using Eq. (3) (with indoor temperature T i n set at 300 K) are also plotted in Fig. 4. As can be seen, human occupancy and activities such as cooking are the major heat generation cases. 4.2 Open and closed-loop simulations 4.2.1 Nominal operation Once the input data is collected, open-loop simulations are run under the nominal operation described by the following: 1. During winter months, i.e., November and January, the PM concentration outdoors are high and temperature outdoors are low. Hence, PAF is operated under maximum flow rate condition and the AC is completely switched off. 2. During summer, i.e., May, PM concentration outdoors is relatively low and temperature outdoors is high. Hence, the AC is operated under the maximum flow rate condition and the PAF is completely switched off. 3. During Fall, i.e., August, both PM concentrations outdoors and temperature outdoors are moderate. Hence, both AC and PAF systems are operated at medium flow rates. 4. The AHU units are operated at a minimal flow rate to ensure minimal ventilation for all the months. 4.2.2 Operation under MPC Following open-loop simulations, closed-loop simulations are performed under MPC. At each time instant, based on the PM concentration and temperature outdoors and PM emission rates and heat generation values indoors, the optimal flow rates for AC, PAF, and AHU are calculated by solving the OCP given by Eq. (11). The power ratings of a typical AHU, PAF, and AC are 60 W, 80 W, and 2000 W, respectively. Therefore, the weights for the corresponding flow rates of the equipment in the OCP objective function (in Eq. (11a)), ρ 1 , ρ 2 , and ρ 3 , are chosen as 1 , 1.33, and 13.33, respectively, according to their relative power ratings. The weights determine the relative importance of equipment operation for the MPC controller. In other words, the controller tries to minimize Q A C , 13.33 times than Q A H U due to the proportionate higher power ratings of the former. To allow output hard-constraint violations to only occur under extreme conditions, a large value of 1000 is chosen for the weights ρ 4 , ρ 5 , and ρ 6 of soft constraint slack variables ϵ 1 , ϵ 2 , and ϵ 3 , respectively. The comfort limit for indoor temperature is assumed to be in the 290 K - 296 K range, whereas the desired upper bound for PM concentrations indoors is set to 40 μ g/m 3 . A prediction horizon of 10 is chosen. The simulations are run for all the four months and the MPC control performance is compared against nominal operation using the following performance indices. 4.3 Metrics for comparison 1. Total energy consumption: is defined as the sum of energy consumption by AHU, PAF, and AC. Assuming AHU as a typical fan, the power consumption is proportional to the cube of the airflow rate. This can be calculated using the equation [33]: (14) P A H U ( t ) = α Q A H U 3 ( t ) Using a similar assumption for the PAF, the power consumed by PAF is: (15) P P A F ( t ) = β Q P A F 3 ( t ) where, α and β are the proportionality constants. The power consumed by the AC system is [9]: (16) P A C ( t ) = ρ a i r Q A C ( t ) c p , a i r [ T i n ( t ) − T c ( t ) ] C O P where, COP is the coefficient of performance of the AC system. The overall power consumption can be calculated by taking a summation of the power consumptions of all the three equipment: (17) P T ( t ) = P A H U ( t ) + P P A F ( t ) + P A C ( t ) Subsequently, the total energy consumed per day can be calculated by: (18) E T = ∫ 0 24 h P T ( t ) d t The variables used to evaluate total energy consumption are also listed in Table 1. 2. Peak deviation: is defined as the maximum deviation of the controlled variables from their desired levels. 3. Time of exposure: is defined as the time duration for which the controlled variables violate the desired levels. 4. IAD: is defined as the integral of the absolute deviation of the controlled variables from the desired levels. 5 Results and discussion The control performances during the month of January, May, August, and November are shown in Figs. 5\u20138, respectively. The first plot from the top shows the variation of indoor temperature, the second plot shows the flow rates of AHU, PAF, and AC, the third plot shows the variation of PM concentration indoors, and the fourth shows the overall power consumption during the entire day for both the nominal and MPC operation cases. 5.1 January In the nominal case, for the winter month of January (see Fig. 5 and Section 4.2.1), the indoor temperature consistently remains within the desired range, except during morning between 09 : 00 − − 12 : 00 , when it falls below the lower comfort limit. The indoor PM concentration constraints are satisfied for a duration of less than 8 hr during the day. However, even with the continuous use of PAF for the entire day, PM concentrations could not be reduced within the desired limits in the nominal case. In the case of operation under MPC, the indoor temperature maintains a similar profile as that of nominal operation, wherein it stays within the desired limits for most of the day, except for a period between 09 : 00 − − 12 : 00 , when it falls below the lower comfort limit. The indoor PM concentration stays close to the threshold of 40 μ g /m 3 . The high indoor emissions resulting from cooking activities during 06 : 00 − − 07 : 00 and 18 : 00 − − 19 : 00 are challenging for the MPC controller to bring PM concentrations within the desired levels. Nevertheless, the controller strives to achieve the desired level or get as close as possible to it by using slack variables as soft constraints (see Eq. (11)) in the MPC formulation. Notably, the controller refrains from increasing the flow rate of the AHU when the outdoor PM concentrations are high due to January\u2019s high PM concentration outdoors. Interestingly, during 12 : 00 − − 20 : 00 , AHU is operated to take advantage of the relatively warm and less polluted outdoor air to regulate indoor variables. In fact, both PAF and AC operate with reduced flow rates during this period. Conversely, during other times, the controller operates both PAF and AC to regulate IAQ, given the high cost of constraint violations relative to energy costs. Despite no significant PM contributing activities during daytime between 08 : 00 − − 18 : 00 , the controller still operates both the AC and the PAF to control indoor PM concentrations during this period. Under MPC operation, the peak deviation in indoor PM concentration is 34 . 17 μ g/m 3 , compared to 127 . 95 μ g/m 3 under the nominal case, resulting in a reduction of approximately 73%. Although cooking activities cause a surge in indoor PM concentration, their effect on indoor temperature is relatively minimal due to the operation of AC units. However, the nominal operation indicates an increase in indoor temperature during 06 : 00 − − 07 : 00 and 18 : 00 − − 19 : 00 . Fig. 5 also shows the total power consumption for the nominal and MPC cases. While the nominal case consumes an average of about 80 W throughout the day, MPC operation has higher energy demands due to the operation of energy-intensive AC units, which are turned off in the nominal case for January. 5.2 May In the nominal case for the summer month of May (see Fig. 6 and Section 4.2.1), due to elevated temperature and low PM concentration outdoors for most part of the day, the flow rates for AHU, PAF, and AC are set to minimum, zero, and maximum values, respectively. Nominal operation of the AC at its maximum flow rate results in maintaining indoor temperature within the desired levels, unaffected by any of the heat generation activities, such as human occupancy and cooking. Since outdoor PM concentrations are low and that the AC operates at the highest possible flow rates, the IAQ is also well-maintained because of the inbuilt filters in the AC unit. Similar to the nominal case, under MPC, the temperature is maintained within the desired levels for the majority of time, except during cooking activity in the evening. As outdoor PM concentrations remain significant only for a few hours in the morning and evening, controlling IAQ using AHU might appear as an energy efficient option. However, this would result in temperature increase indoors due to the hot air outdoors. Hence, the MPC controller increases the flow rate of AC to control both temperature and PM concentration indoors using its inbuilt filter. During the high PM emission activities, such as cooking, the controller increases the flow rates of PAF to quickly reduce the indoor PM concentration. The operation under MPC results in a reduction in peak deviation in PM concentration indoors by approximately 49% and the power consumption by approximately 17% compared to the nominal case. 5.3 August In the nominal case for the fall month of August (see Fig. 7 and Section 4.2.1), the temperature indoors exceed the desired level by approximately 1 K as the chosen medium flow rate for AC is insufficient to keep the temperature within the desired levels. The PM concentration outdoors is low. Hence, under nominal operation, the PM concentration indoors remain within the desired limit, except the minor deviations during the high PM emission activity indoors, such as cooking. Under MPC, the flow rates of AHU and PAF are at their minimum, except during high PM emission activity indoors, and the controller maintains both temperature and PM concentration indoors using only the AC. The operation under MPC results in a reduction in peak deviation in PM concentration indoors by approximately 79% with a marginal increase in power consumption by approximately 4% (due to the increased AC operation) compared to the nominal case. 5.4 November In the nominal case for the winter month of November (see Fig. 8 and Section 4.2.1), the AC is turned off and the PAF is operated at the maximum flow rate as the temperature is moderate and PM concentration is high outdoors. However, human occupancy and heat generation activity indoors, combined with relatively high temperature outdoors during daytime, make the temperature indoors exceed the desired comfort level for most of the day. However, the PM concentration indoors remain within the desired level only during some periods in the evening, when PM concentration outdoors is relatively low, despite the PAF operating at its maximum capacity as the PM concentration outdoors is high throughout the day. Under MPC, the temperature indoors is maintained within the desired range by optimally changing the flow rates of both AC and AHU. The AHU is an energy efficient option to cool indoor space by bringing cool air from outdoors. However, this increases the PM concentration indoors. Hence, AHU operation is not considered by the MPC controller. However, the optimal settings of PAF and AC are calculated in order to achieve IAQ and thermal comfort indoors. The operation under MPC results in a reduction in peak deviation in PM concentration indoors by approximately 70% and an approximately 6 times increase in power consumption (due to the increased AC operation for improved thermal comfort) compared to the nominal case. 5.5 Performance comparison Table 3 lists the performance metrics for all the considered months under both the nominal and MPC cases. Operation under MPC results in significant reduction in peak deviation in PM concentration indoors (third column) compared to the nominal operation. The overall reduction in average peak deviation is approximately 69%. During the winter months of November and January, the reduction is higher (greater than 69%) than during summer or August (greater than 40%), despite the PAF operating at the maximum flow rate, due to high PM concentration outdoors. The result differs somewhat from that reported by Vyas et al. [8], who achieved significant reduction using only the HEPA PAF, however, without considering PM emission activity indoors listed in Table 2, such as cooking and human occupancy. Also, the non-zero minimal flow rate of AHU considered in this work to ensure minimal ventilation adds to the PM concentration indoors. Although, operation under MPC results in higher time of exposure to undesired levels of PM concentration indoors by an average of approximately 3.5% (fifth column), IAD values and PM indoor curves (third row plots in Figs. 5\u20138) suggest only small magnitude deviation compared to the nominal case. The peak deviation in temperature (fourth column) in the nominal case is higher in August and November by approximately 1.3 K and 1.9 K, respectively, as the flow rates of the AC considered are insufficient to maintain temperature indoors within the desired levels. However, the MPC controller varies the flow rate of AC optimally to keep the temperature within the desired levels, resulting in an overall reduction by approximately 47%. Although the time of exposure to undesired temperature indoors (sixth column) is noticeably higher for MPC operation during May and August, the IAD values of < 1 K-hr suggest that the magnitude of the undesired deviation is very small. Nevertheless, the borderline operation results in a higher time of exposure of more than 14 hr for MPC operation. The controller also reduces the IAD for temperature by approximately 75%. Finally, the energy consumption (second column) driven by the operation of energy-intensive AC, is higher in May for nominal case than in other months. In May, the AC operates at its maximum flow rate, resulting in higher energy consumption. However, AC is switched off in the winter months of November and January and is operated at medium flow rate in August, resulting in lower energy consumption in these months. Note that AC reduces both temperature and PM concentrations (using the inbuilt filter). Under MPC, the energy consumption decreases in May, whereas it increases marginally in August and substantially in November and January, due to the increased AC operation compared to the nominal case. The overall energy consumption results in an increase by approximately 10.4% under MPC compared to the nominal case to significantly reduce and maintain PM concentration and temperature indoors close to their desired levels under substantial variations in both outdoor conditions and indoor emissions. 5.5.1 Limitation The limitation of this study is that no field investigations have been conducted to validate the model-based predictive control strategy, a futuristic technology. Moreover, the single-zone test house is a simplification, but is a reasonable approximation for small-to-medium-sized apartments in metropolis, such as Delhi. For larger apartments, multi-zone analysis have to be performed. Note that care has been taken to obtain the model parameter values, from experimentally validated studies, and historical outdoor condition data. Therefore, the results could be used to observe general trends and look for performance enhancement opportunities. The MPC experimental set up with all the ventilation actuators on a building is expensive. This computational study provides a rough estimate of the benefits of MPC development and deployment for enhanced performance. Studies on potential benefits of using PAF to reduce indoor pollutants and the use of optimal control of air conditioning systems to regulate indoor temperature have been reported in the literature [8,14,71,72]. Moreover, several studies on using AC to control temperature indoors have been reported in the literature [25,32,33]. However, this work on nonlinear MPC using AHU, AC, and PAF for simultaneous control of temperature and pollutant concentration indoors, especially under extreme outdoor conditions, as experienced in Delhi, to our knowledge, has not been performed and reported in the literature. Hence, we believe, the computational study is first-of-its-kind and would encourage further research in this field, customized to the local conditions. 6 Conclusions In this paper, a nonlinear MPC controller is developed to identify optimized settings of AHU, PAF and AC systems. A physics-based model is developed to predict the PM concentration and temperature indoors as a function of outdoor and indoor conditions, and operational settings of the control system actuators. A case study in Delhi, a city with high PM concentration outdoors, is conducted for different months of the year to evaluate the MPC controller performance under seasonal variations. The PM emission and heat generation rates for common indoor activities are also considered. Numerical simulation results show a reduction in peak deviation in PM concentrations indoors under MPC by approximately 69% compared to the nominal case. Although time of exposure to undesired levels of PM concentrations increase by 3.5%, IAD reduction by 93% suggest a borderline control operation around the threshold value of 40 μ g/m 3 . Similar trends are observed for the temperature indoors, where the peak deviation under MPC results in a reducion by 47%, with only an approximately 10.4% increase in energy consumption, compared to the nominal case. These findings, we believe, will encourage further research, both computational and experimental, in developing MPC controllers to minimize energy consumption, while controlling pollutant concentration and ensuring thermal comfort indoors in buildings.

        "dc:description": "This paper presents a novel, model-based approach for energy-focused indoor particulate matter (PM) concentration control and indoor temperature management for a residential house. A physics-based model is developed to predict PM concentration and temperature indoors as a function of outdoor PM concentration, outdoor temperature, indoor emission, indoor heat generation, and flow rates of air handling unit (AHU), portable air filter (PAF), and air conditioning (AC) systems. The optimized settings of the ventilation systems AHU, PAF, and AC are determined employing a nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) algorithm. A case study in Delhi, one of the most polluted cities in the world, is conducted. Extensive simulation studies under seasonal changes in outdoor conditions and varying indoor emissions demonstrate the ability of the MPC controller to maintain PM concentration and temperature indoors within or close to the desired levels, while optimizing energy consumption.",
