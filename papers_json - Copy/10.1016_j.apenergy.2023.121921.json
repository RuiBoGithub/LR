The optimization of the operation of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems has gained considerable attention due to its energy conservation potential. Collecting various building operation data presents an opportunity to improve the efficiency of energy management and reduce consumption. In this paper, a data-driven online energy management framework is proposed for enhancing the effectiveness of HVAC systems and minimizing energy consumption. To streamline the modeling process and improve the accuracy of temperature estimation, our proposed framework adopts a symbolic regression approach to estimate building thermodynamics based on the collected data. It also formulates a model predictive control (MPC)-based HVAC scheduling strategy to optimize HVAC operations while maximizing thermal comfort and reducing energy consumption and peak power demand. We conducted on-site experiments to evaluate the proposed framework and demonstrated a notable reduction in total energy consumption in both HVAC cooling and heating operations: average reductions of 4.9% and 30.2%, and 49.3% and 73.9% for best cases in the on-site experiment under certain conditions. In the heating operation, the proposed data-driven HVAC management framework efficiently utilized indoor/outdoor heat generation to maintain comfortable temperature levels without activating the HVAC. Such effective utilization of heat sources shortened the HVAC runtimes and further reduced the total energy consumption. With the proposed framework, the average HVAC peak power demand fell by 25.8% and 35.1% during cooling and heating operations in the on-site experiment with certain scenarios. On-site experiment results demonstrated the proposed framework can efficiently suppress peak power demand, reduce energy consumption in both cooling and heating operation under certain conditions. The framework\u2019s data-driven approach provides an effective means of optimizing HVAC operations, reducing energy consumption, and improving the thermal comfort of the building\u2019s occupants. Keywords Online energy management HVAC Symbolic regression Thermal comfort MPC Experimental study Data availability Data will be made available on request 1 Introduction The worldwide building sector annually accounts for 30% of global final energy consumption and 27% of total energy sector emissions. According to analysis by the International Energy Agency (IEA) [1], almost half of a building\u2019s final energy use is related to heating/cooling of its space, and almost 45% of the energy consumed in the building sector is directly related to heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. By implementing efficient HVAC operation without compromising the thermal comfort of occupants, the energy consumption of buildings can be slashed. In recent years, various control strategies have been applied by HVAC systems, including fuzzy logic control, genetic algorithms (GA), and model predictive control (MPC), all of which have remarkably improved energy efficiency and comfort. MPC is commonly used in modern HVAC control due to its ability to precisely manage complex systems while taking into account multiple objectives and constraints [2]. MPC methods build a system model of a target system, which predicts future system behavior based on current control input. Based on the model prediction result, the MPC algorithm determines the optimal control input to minimize such performance criteria as deviations from the setpoint temperature while satisfying such constraints as environmental temperature, electricity tariffs, HVAC capacity, and building occupancy. One key benefit provided by MPC under HVAC control is its ability to take into account both short- and long-term objectives. The MPC algorithm optimizes control input to minimize energy consumption over a specified prediction horizon and simultaneously ensures that the system satisfies constraints, such as temperature bounds and system capacity. MPC-based HVAC energy management studies can be categorized as either model-driven and data-driven approaches [3]. The former calculates building thermodynamics by formulating equivalent thermal parameters with explicit equations. These parameters are either calculated from building construction data and/or measurement data or estimated by parameter identification techniques using indirect measurement data. However, obtaining functional relationships in practical applications is not a trivial task due to the complex thermodynamic behaviors of buildings and weather disturbances. Unfortunately, such parameters as the thermal resistance and the thermal capacitance of buildings are usually not readily available since measuring them accurately and directly is difficult. These parameters depend on several factors, including a building\u2019s construction, insulation, and occupancy patterns, all of which can vary widely among different buildings and even within the same structure. In practical applications, it can be complicated to construct an indoor temperature dynamics model with a high degree of accuracy. As machine learning and sensing technologies continue to advance, data-driven methods are becoming more popular for estimating building thermodynamics. Such methods analyze the interaction among various thermal inputs and building thermodynamics. By analyzing large amounts of data, machine learning algorithms can identify thermal patterns and correlations that are difficult to discern with traditional modeling techniques. In contrast to model-driven methods, data-driven methods significantly simplify a building\u2019s thermodynamic modeling process by reducing the need for detailed physical models and simplifying the calibration process. Furthermore, with sufficient training data, data-driven methods enable more accurate predictions of building thermodynamics, leading to more efficient HVAC control [4]. Although several studies have argued that the energy efficiency of HVAC systems can be improved with various model- or data-driven HVAC management strategies, there is insufficient experiment evidence to support such claims [5]. In this paper, we designed and implemented a data-driven MPC to optimize HVAC energy management and evaluated its suitability for real-world applications. We considered a heating/cooling system, which is designed for a computer science laboratory that is equivalent to a typical office, and implemented a symbolic regression-based energy management framework that satisfies occupants\u2019 thermal comfort by minimizing the HVAC system\u2019s energy consumption. The following are the main contributions of this study: \u2022 We proposed a data-driven online HVAC energy management framework that utilizes a symbolic regression approach to predict room temperature changes. Since this approach relies on data that can be acquired from built-in HVAC sensors, it imposes minimal requirements on hardware. \u2022 We evaluated our data-driven online HVAC energy management framework by implementing an on-site experiment that spanned different seasons in a computer science laboratory that is equivalent to a typical office space. The total energy consumption of the HVAC system under the proposed data-driven HVAC energy management framework fell by 4.9% and 30.2%, and the peak power demand was reduced by 25.8% and 35.1% for cooling and heating operations on average compared to rule-based control in the on-site experiment with certain scenarios. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 summarizes related studies and highlights how our contributions differ from them. Section 3 overviews our proposed data-driven HVAC management framework. Section 4 presents the simulation results of our proposed framework, including comparisons with related studies. An on-site experiment, which includes two case studies, is described and analyzed in Section 5. Finally, we conclude and describe directions for future work in Section 6. 2 Related studies 2.1 Building thermodynamics estimation methods Model predictive control requires a system scheme to predict the system\u2019s states. In the field of HVAC control, variations in building thermodynamics must be estimated for constructing an accurate system model. Different modeling techniques for predicting/estimating building thermodynamics, i.e., indoor temperature, are available in the literature. Physical and analytical models calculate temperature changes using commercial software with detailed building construction data [6\u201310] and estimate thermal parameters using parameter identification techniques with high computational cost [11\u201314]. Although these models can provide detailed information on building thermal behavior and energy usage, the parameters are difficult to obtain or sometimes unavailable due to a variety of factors, including the lack of measurements, insufficient data, changes in building use, and limited accessibility. In contrast, data-driven methods in building temperature prediction completely rely on historical/online experiment data and provide great prediction accuracy when sufficient training data are available. Ding et al. [15] conducted a study on data-driven heating load prediction methods in low-temperature district heating. They used two Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to predict short-term district heating load. Such thermal load predictions can potentially provide valuable insights for improving building energy management efficiency. Chen et al. [16] described transfer learning with a deep neural network (DNN) to capture building thermodynamics, including natural ventilation. This transfer-learning method has potential for the design of control systems for new buildings. Han et al. [17] proposed a rainbow deep reinforcement learning method for heat pump operation. According to their simulation, with efficiently limiting the maximum number of HP operations by increasing the thermal storage in advance to match future thermal load demands, the year-round demand charge can be reduced by 23.1%. Leprince et al. [18] used symbolic regression to automate the identification of thermal dynamics models from data. Another work found 50 unique models in 241 residential buildings in the Netherlands [18]. These models can identify and calibrate models for MPC. Mba et al. [19] used ANNs to predict indoor air temperature and relative humidity in a modern building located in Cameroon\u2019s hot-humid Douala region. The ANN model takes into account the last 12 hourly values of the indoor air temperature and relative humidity as well as the last 12 hourly values of the outdoor air relative humidity. In contrast to a model-driven method, a data-driven method significantly simplifies the building thermodynamics modeling process, and with sufficient historical/online data, it can achieve high prediction accuracy and efficiency for thermodynamics estimation. In this paper, we adopt Leprince et al.\u2019s method [18] for proposed data-driven HVAC energy management framework to estimate the room temperature only with the limited sensor data. 2.2 Review on HVAC management studies and on-site experiments Numerous studies have described the potential benefits of using advance control strategies to improve the energy efficiency of HVAC systems in residential and commercial buildings [2,20,21]. The typical control strategies include proportional\u2013integral\u2013derivative (PID) [22,23], mixed-integer-linear-programming (MILP) [24], robust optimization [25\u201327], stochastic programming [28,29] and Lyapunov optimization [30,31]. With the development of machine learning technologies, reinforcement learning (RL) [32], deep reinforcement learning (DRL) [33,34], data-driven MPC [4] are beginning to show their superiority for control of non-linear systems. Among all control methods, MPC has gained more attention due to its ability to deal with nonlinear system dynamics, as well as hard constraints on inputs, states, and outputs, and to take performance criteria into account. For instance, Alvarez et al. [35] proposed for HVAC systems an optimal controller that distributes energy consumption rates inside a building while maintaining user comfort. Their optimization procedure is based on the Lagrangian dual method, and their proposed strategy\u2019s effectiveness is examined through a test-bed model. Ostadijafari et al. [36] investigated a non-linear economic MPC for a smart building that includes HVAC systems, PV generation, flexible appliances, and a battery system. Their work\u2019s goal is to minimize electricity costs under time-dependent price signals and track comfort temperature ranges based on occupancy information. Chanthawit et al. [37] designed a model predictive controller for HVAC to minimize operating cost by peak-shaving and thermal comfort. Despite the efforts of past studies, the measured performances remain inadequate from MPC implementation in field experiments with typical HVAC systems and control architectures. Among the MPC-based HVAC control schemes using a model-driven method, Sorin et al. [38] conducted an on-site experiment for multi-zone HVAC units serving an existing mid-sized commercial building. Their demonstration results show average energy savings of 20% during the transitions between seasons, 70% during the heating season, and 10% or more in peak power reduction. In a Belgian office building, Drgona et al. [8] implemented a large-scale white-box-based MPC, based on first-principle physical equations. Their implementation verified the supremacy of MPC, where energy usage was reduced by 53.5% and thermal comfort improved by 36.9% compared to traditional rule-based control (RBC). Abdul et al. [39] implemented a supervisory model predictive controller in residential buildings and significantly lowered costs. Compared to fixed setpoints, variable setpoints with a supervisory controller reduced costs by 16%. Yang et al. [40] presented an experimental MPC study for an air-conditioning system with a dedicated outdoor air system (DOAS). This MPC system, which employs a linear building model to optimize energy use and indoor comfort, was experimentally demonstrated in a lecture theater for real-time control and achieved 20% energy savings and greatly improved the indoor environment. Zhao et al. [13] implemented MPC-based HVAC optimization framework to a university laboratory. Their implemented results demonstrated that the concentrated workload of HVAC systems can be spread and achieved a maximum of approximately 37% peak power reduction in simulations. Their study estimated temperatures by a simple first-order thermal equivalent circuit model with a simple linear coefficient of performance (COP), HVAC energy consumption model. Zhao\u2019s framework is an extension of Watari\u2019s multi-time scale energy management framework [41] for HVAC applications based on the optimization of a linear occupants\u2019 thermal comfort index with an HVAC energy consumption function. On the other hand, MPC-based HVAC control schemes using a data-driven method, such as, Maddalena et al. [5], implemented a Gaussian process-based MPC to control a HVAC system in a hospital. Their on-site implementation tested how effectively MPCs provided thermal comfort for occupants and minimized the associated electrical demand with the uncertainty of internal heat gain. Young et al. [42] implemented a real-time predictive control of an HVAC system for an ice-cream factory. Four artificial neural network (ANN) models were developed to predict the thermal states of the supply air and the indoor air of two thermal zones. Their results suggested that with a real-time MPC, the energy consumption was reduced approximately 31.7% compared to a simple rule-based strategy. Unfortunately, these studies only focused on HVAC cooling operation without verifying the efficiency and effectiveness of data-driven HVAC management in an office environment. In this paper, we propose and implement a data-driven online energy management framework for HVAC systems. The proposed framework is an extension of Zhao\u2019s method [13] and has two main features; (1) it uses a data-driven approach called symbolic regression to predict room temperature changes without requiring detailed building envelope data for modeling to predict temperature changes; (2) instead of using additional sensors, this framework only uses the built-in sensors of the HVAC system namely the temperature sensors of HVAC indoor/outdoor units that significantly reduces the system cost. The proposed framework is also implemented in a computer science laboratory, which is equivalent to a typical office space, and performed on-site experiments during both cooling and heating operations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper of an on-site experiment for the data-driven HVAC management for cooling and heating of office environments. 3 Data-driven HVAC management framework 3.1 Overview An overview of our proposed data-driven HVAC management framework is shown in Fig. 1 where a data-driven MPC approach is used for HVAC control. The proposed framework, which utilizes the acquired sensing data, including but not limited to room temperature, HVAC operation data, and weather forecast data, predicts room temperature changes by symbolic regression. This predictive information, in conjunction with the thermal comfort estimation results obtained from the thermal comfort model, is used as input for the model predictive controller. This controller generates outputs, such as the temperature setpoint, which are fed-back to the HVAC system. This process maintains a reasonable thermal comfort level and simultaneously reduces the peak power demand and energy consumption. The proposed framework minimizes the following three objectives in an optimal HVAC operational schedule: \u2022 Total energy consumption for the planning period; \u2022 Difference between most comfortable and actual room temperatures; \u2022 HVAC power ramp rate for peak power demand reduction. 3.2 Symbolic regression-based temperature prediction As described in Section 2, room temperature changes must be predicted by HVAC management. Room temperature can be affected by heat transfers from outdoor environments, heat generated by indoor electronic devices, etc. However, sensing these factors requires additional hardware, and it might be impossible to obtain sufficient data due to a lack of sensors or the specifications of the HVAC system. Moreover, in some instances, methods for accessing the capacity of HVAC systems are unavailable, as in related study [43]. Data-driven approaches can predict changes in room temperature to achieve HVAC management with limited data. In the proposed HVAC energy management framework, Leprince\u2019s symbolic regression (SR) method [18] is adopted for the one-day ahead prediction of room temperature. Symbolic regression is a machine learning technique that uses symbolic expressions (or mathematical expressions) to represent the relationships between variables. The goal of symbolic regression is to find a mathematical expression that accurately represents the relationships between variables, based on a set of input\u2013output data. Fig. 2 intuitively represents an expression tree structure in symbolic regression to find the mathematical expression that best fits a given dataset. In symbolic regression, a model is represented as a treelike structure, where nodes represent mathematical operations or functions applied to input explanatory variables, and leaves represent the final output or result of regression equations. The process of identifying the best expression involves adjusting the model\u2019s parameters, such as the operations and variables used, to minimize the differences between the actual outputs and those predicted by the model. One key advantage of symbolic regression is that it can find the relationships between variables that are not obvious from the data. Since it can also handle non-linear relationships and higher-order interactions between variables, it is suitable for temperature prediction applications. Similar to the thermal equivalent circuit model (TECM) [13], SR uses historical data to estimate the mathematical expressions of room temperature. On the other hand, TECM determines the parameters for already determined prediction equations by fitting historical data, although SR uses a data-driven approach that simultaneously explores the form of a predictive equation and its parameters. When the objective variable of symbolic regression is Y and the explanatory variable is X , symbolic regression identifies combinations of variables, coefficients, and operators of function f S R such that Y = f S R ( X ) . For example, when room temperature T t i n , outdoor temperature T t o u t , HVAC power consumption D t , and HVAC capacity Q t at time t are used as SR inputs, explanatory variable X t can be expressed as follows: (1) X t = T t i n T t o u t D t Q t . Notice that HVAC capacity represents the amount of heat it can remove or put into the building environment per unit time with a unit of kW. The HVAC power consumption is decided by the HVAC capacity and the environmental conditions such as temperatures. The room temperature prediction equation generated by SR involves searching for a function that can find room temperature T t + 1 i n at the next time step t + 1 from input variable X t at a given time step t . Fig. 3 overviews the creation of temperature prediction function using SR. Here N groups of samples are the combinations of the explanatory and objective variables that are given as training data for symbolic regression, and each of these samples is selected by shifting the past series data one step. For each sample, the current time step is defined by the time of the latest explanatory variables, where the current time steps for Sample 1, Sample 2, \u2026, Sample N are X t , X t + 1 , \u2026, X t + N − 1 , and the objective variables are one-step ahead of the current time step. In this study, we use both the explanatory variables on current time step t and up to one-step behind t − 1 , a -step behind t − 1 ⋅ a , \u2026, n ⋅ a -step behind t − n ⋅ a 1 1 A resolution with a -step can only be used from a -step behind to n ⋅ a -step behind. to search the prediction function. Predicted temperature T ˆ t + 1 i n for next time step t + 1 can be expressed by the following function: (2) T ˆ t + 1 i n = f ( X t , X t − 1 , X t − 1 ⋅ a , \u2026 , X t − n ⋅ a ) . In this study, the symbolic regression was done by PySR library [44]. Table 1 lists the values in this framework for the parameters that can be set when performing symbolic regression in PySR, where we use Euclidean distance, L2Distance(), as the loss function. The constraints, \u201c*\u201d:(2,1) says that multiplication can have 2 complexity left argument, but only 1 complexity in the right argument. Since symbolic regression uses random numbers to perform such genetic processing as mutation and crossover, some values of random numbers may fall into a locally optimal solution and terminate the search despite the existence of a better solution. Therefore, symbolic regression is done multiple times to obtain multiple prediction functions, and the most accurate function is selected by evaluating valuation index P e r r o r which is governed by the following equation: (3) P e r r o r = ∑ t = 1 t = M − 1 ( T ˆ t i n − T t i n ) 2 M , where M is the total planning period and T t i n and T ˆ t i n are the actual and predicted room temperatures at time t . 3.3 Mathematical formulation of HVAC control problem This section describes the mathematical formulation of the HVAC control problem. Note that the formulation presented here is based on related work [13]. As explained in Section 3.2, we use the following building thermal model, f S R ( X ) , generated by symbolic regression: (4) T t + 1 i n = f S R ( X t , \u2026 , X t − N ) , ∀ t . To maintain a comfortable indoor environment, the indoor temperature is regulated within a specific comfort range: (5) T l o w e r − s t ≤ T t i n ≤ T u p p e r + s t , ∀ t , (6) 0 ≤ s t , ∀ t , where T l o w e r and T u p p e r denote the lower and upper bounds for the indoor temperature. This temperature boundary is calculated by a linear regression Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) thermal comfort model [13]. Slack variable s t is also a decision variable, taking a positive value when it exceeds the lower/upper bound. In practical applications, if the prediction error of the room temperature exceeds the specified limit, the optimization problem may become infeasible. To address this issue, slack variable s t can relax the problem to ensure feasibility. In actual HVAC systems, operation is not feasible in the low load range. To represent this state, binary variable z t is introduced to indicate the HVAC status, where z t = 1 represents that the system is on, and z t = 0 represents that it is off for time-step t . The following constraint on HVAC power consumption D t for time-step t is defined based on this variable: (7) z t ⋅ D l o w e s t ≤ D t ≤ z t ⋅ D r a t e d , ∀ t , where D l o w e s t is the lowest possible power consumption when HVAC is operating, and D r a t e d is the HVAC system\u2019s rated power consumption. The proposed formulation includes three objectives: minimization of total energy consumption, maximization of thermal comfort, and minimization of power peak. Energy consumption term J c o n s u m e is defined by (8) J c o n s u m e = ∑ t = 1 t = M D t D r a t e d ⋅ M . Note that the term in question is normalized by dividing it with the worst-case value of D r a t e d ⋅ T , where M represents the total planning period. This normalization approach maintains a balance between the pursued objectives and ensures that they are effectively achieved. On the other hand, thermal comfort term J c o m f o r t is expressed as (9) J c o m f o r t = ∑ t = 1 t = M O t ⋅ ( T t i n − T r e f ) 2 ∑ t = 1 t = M O t ⋅ max T u p p e r − T r e f , T r e f − T l o w e r 2 , where O t is the room\u2019s occupant information and O t = 1 represents an occupied room, and otherwise O t = 0 , and T r e f is the room\u2019s target temperature. Term J c o m f o r t is also normalized by dividing it with the worst-case value for thermal comfort ∑ t = 1 t = M O t ⋅ max T u p p e r − T r e f , T r e f − T l o w e r 2 , where max ( ⋅ , ⋅ ) selects the larger value. The proposed formulation is also designed to suppress power consumption during specific periods, such as early morning when people arrive at buildings and mid-noon when they take a break. The increment of HVAC power consumption Δ D t at time-step t can be expressed as follows: (10) Δ D t = D t − D t − 1 , 1 ≤ t ≤ M . The peak suppression logic is described as follows: (11) ( 1 − γ t ) ⋅ Δ D t + γ t ⋅ c o n ⋅ Δ D t ≤ Δ D m a x , 1 ≤ t ≤ M where D m a x is the maximum increment of the power consumption, which is also a decision variable. When γ t = 1 , power peak suppression is performed; when γ t = 0 , no power peak suppression occurs. To suppress increment Δ D t during periods of γ t = 1 , penalty constant c o n is introduced. By minimizing Δ D m a x in the above equation, increment Δ D t can be suppressed during the schedule\u2019s period. Peak-power-suppression term J p e a k is the normalization of Δ D m a x using its rated value D r a t e d : (12) J p e a k = Δ D m a x D r a t e d . Finally, the proposed framework solves the following optimization problem every t step: (13) minimize ω ⋅ J c o n s u m e + ( 1 − ω ) ⋅ J c o m f o r t + J p e a k + P e ⋅ ∑ t = 0 t = M − 1 s t , subject to (4)-(12) , input O t , ∀ t , decision variables { D t , Δ D m a x , s t } , ∀ t , where ω is a weight parameter that adjusts the importance between total energy consumption J c o n s u m e and thermal comfort J c o m f o r t , which ranges from 0 to 1, ω = 0.1 denotes that the occupant\u2019s thermal comfort in the HVAC operation period is the main consideration, ω = 0.5 denotes that the balance between thermal comfort and energy consumption is the main consideration in the operation period, and ω = 0.9 means that the energy consumption is the main consideration in the scheduling period; and P e is a penalty coefficient. 4 Simulation evaluation To evaluate the symbolic regression (SR) performance, we conducted a simulation comparison between SR and a thermal equivalent circuit model (TECM) in terms of temperature prediction. In the simulation, we used the actual room temperatures from the HVAC operation data on December 4, 2021 to obtain the TECM, identify the model parameters, and train the SR for generating the next day temperature prediction function. We used the December 5, 2021 temperature and HVAC operation data to verify the performance for both SR and TECM, where the HVAC system operated from 7:00 to 17:00 on 25 °C. For symbolic regression, the time step is 15 min, and variables a and n in Eq. (2) are 12 and 8. We searched for the prediction function using room temperature T i n , outdoor temperature T o u t , power consumption D , and HVAC capacity Q over the past 15 min, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 h. Based on our preliminary experiment, a time interval of three hours is the maximum allowable time step without loss of prediction accuracy in symbolic regression. Moreover, to reduce computational overhead we have chosen the most suitable time step of three hours. Symbolic regression was done on a laptop 2 2 Thinkpad T14s, Intel i5-10310U with 16 GB RAM. with the PySR library [44]. To simplify the optimization process, the SR used only operators with addition, subtraction, and multiplication, and so a linear equation was always obtained. The operators used in the symbolic regression are addition, subtraction, and multiplication. In the case of multiplication, we set a restriction where only one side of the operator is allowed to be a variable, and so a linear equation was always obtained. The most accurate prediction function of SR in the simulation is expressed as (14) T t + 1 i n = 0 . 880 ⋅ T t i n + 0 . 018 ⋅ D t − 24 − 0 . 197 ⋅ Q t − 1 + 0 . 264 ⋅ Q t + 2 . 249 . In this simulation, the symbolic regression takes approximately nine hours to search for a temperature prediction function. The temperature prediction function of TECM in the simulation is expressed as (15) T t + 1 i n = 1 − △ t R ⋅ C T t i n + △ t R ⋅ C ( T t o u t + 1000 ⋅ R ⋅ Q t ) , where R and C are the thermal resistance and capacitance, respectively. In the TECM, we utilize different parameter values in idle and operation periods, the R is 0.56 and 1.27 and C is 148.361 and 0.947 for idle and operation periods, respectively. Fig. 4 shows the temperature prediction results of the proposed SR-based framework and the TECM model-based control in the simulation, where the black, red and blue solid lines represent the room temperature changes in the simulation\u2019s observations, the TECM model-based control, and the SR-based framework. We confirmed that the room temperature predicted using SR, shown by the blue line, is very close to the actual room temperature, shown by the black line. On the other hand, the room temperature predicted using TECM, shown by the red line, did not accurately reflect the temperature changes, especially at the HVAC start/stop operation point. Table 2 summarizes the temperature prediction accuracy of SR and TECM in terms of Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), R-Squared ( R 2 ), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The accuracy of the predictions made by the symbolic regression was also superior in all the above terms. 5 On-site experiment 5.1 Building and HVAC system The structure considered in this study was a six-floor research building at Osaka University in Suita, Japan (Fig. 5). We focused on one room in the southeast corner of the fourth floor. Fig. 5 shows its layout, a general laboratory of the information science and technology department. Its floor area is approximately 179 m 2 ; its ceiling is approximately 2.9 m high. The room consists of two parts: a 164 m 2 workspace and a 15 m 2 server area. The workspace contains 37 computers including 20 GPU workstations. It has two exterior wells facing the south and east, which are easily affected by direct solar irradiation, as marked in the blue line in Fig. 5. An HVAC plant provides a suitable indoor climate for the occupants. Six indoor units (HITACHI RCI-GP90K3) and one outdoor unit (HITACHI RAS-AP560SSR) have been installed in this laboratory. We controlled only five indoor units (the red box in Fig. 5) for the workspace. One server room\u2019s indoor units were not included in this experiment because it operates 24/7. The specifications of the indoor/outdoor HVAC units are listed in Table 3. 5.2 System structure Fig. 6 shows a diagram of the complete system, which includes two edge computers, a power meter, a high-performance server, 3 3 FUJITSU PRIMERGY RX4770 M3, Intel Xeon E7-8890 v4, 24 core, 2.2 GHz with 16 GB RAM. a BACnet adapter, a central controller, and a HVAC system. Edge computer 1, ES1, 4 4 OpenBlocks IoT VX2, Intel Atom E3805 Duelcore, 1.33 GHz with 2 GB RAM. acts as a main computer to execute the optimization framework, and edge computer 2, ES2, 5 5 WAGO 752-9401, Intel Atom E3845 Quadcore, 1.91 GHz with 8 GB RAM. acts as a bridge to communicate with the dedicated HVAC central controller 6 6 HITACHI PSC-A32MN1. via the BACnet protocol. The high-performance server acts as a symbolic regression training computer to execute the training process. The SR-model training, validation, and testing process will require three days of temperature and power consumption data. The training results, namely, the one-day ahead temperature prediction function, are updated to ES1 for further optimization. The ES2 collects and preprocess data on the power consumption of the outdoor HVAC units, and sensing data such as the intake temperature. Set the HVAC system to start/stop, and change the temperature setting point. ES1 communicates with ES2 through the WebSocket protocol to acquire such sensing data as the intake temperature and power consumption data to search for the temperature function using symbolic regression. The optimization calculations are performed using the measured data and weather forecasting data. From these calculations, control signals, including temperature setting points and start/stop commands, are determined. These control signals are then relayed back to ES2, which translates these commands into the BACnet protocol and sends them to the dedicated HVAC controller. These industrial-grade edge computing devices are compact, easy to install, and affordable. They can also be replaced with consumer-grade devices like the Raspberry Pi. Fig. 6 shows a diagram for the system connections and field photos of the hardware. It should be noticed that the proposed framework only requires temperature and power consumption data to generate the one-day ahead temperature prediction function. The required temperature data can be collected with any HVAC system, since we only use room temperature data from HVAC built-in sensors and weather forecasting data from the internet. The required power consumption data can be collected with the HVAC system or with an individual power sensor. As described in Section 3, the proposed framework takes an MPC approach, in which the optimization calculations are performed periodically on the edge server. This optimization computation finds the ideal room temperature and the start/stop status for the planning period. Since HVAC operation is controlled based on the temperature, air volume, and air direction settings, these items must be controlled to achieve the results of the optimization calculations. Therefore the set temperature and start/stop commands are entered into the HVAC based on the results of the optimization calculations. 5.3 Experiment setup In this on-site experiment, the room\u2019s temperature becomes the average value of the input temperatures of the indoor HVAC units. Outdoor temperature prediction data are obtained from the weather forecast data around the Suita campus of Osaka University using an OpenWeather API [45]. The control and prediction horizons for the optimization calculation are 24 h each, and an optimization calculation is done every 15 min to update the control input. Based on the hardware limitations of the HVAC system and the coarse-grained energy management time resolution in a previous work [41], 15 min is the most suitable setting for the time resolution to balance the solution accuracy and complexity. Furthermore, the peak power demand and the ramp rate of the HVAC system are strongly suppressed from 5:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. Symbolic regression is done on a high-performance server with the PySR library [44]. To simplify the optimization process, the SR uses only operators with addition, subtraction, and multiplication, and so a linear equation is always obtained. The decision variables described in Section 3.2 are room temperature T i n , HVAC power consumption D , and outdoor temperature T o u t with a = 12 and n = 8 : the explanatory variables from the past 15 min, 3, 6, 9... 24 h. To avoid falling into local solutions, symbolic regressions were performed five times under identical conditions, and the best equation was selected from the obtained equations. In the on-site experiment, symbolic regression takes an average of 86 min to generate the temperature prediction function, and the framework takes an average of nine minutes to complete the MPC problem calculation and update the temperature setpoints. The experiment\u2019s actual operation process is shown in Fig. 7, where the blue and red arrows represent the MPC operation and the SR training process. Since the SR training time is significantly longer than the MPC computation time, in the experiments, the SR training on the high-performance server started at 22:00 on the day before the planning day. The SR training result (the temperature prediction function) is updated to edge computer ES1 before 00:00 on the planning day. In this on-site experiment, the main focus is on two energy/power related metrics, total energy consumption and 30-min-averaged peak power consumption. Under our assumption, the electrical market bases its tariffs on the maximum power demand. The power demand is gauged using a measuring instrument, and the average power is computed in 30-min increments. The highest value recorded in a month is considered the maximum power demand for that month. The contracted tariff for each month is determined by the largest value of the maximum power demand recorded over the past year. Therefore, by suppressing the 30-min peak power demand, the proposed framework can effectively limit the contracted tariff, thereby facilitating significant savings in electricity costs. Moreover, in this study, the temperature recorded by the HVAC intake sensor is considered as the target temperature. During our preliminary experiment we found out that due to natural air movement, where hot air rises and cool air falls, the temperature captured by the HVAC built-in sensor is approximately 2 °C to 3 °C higher than the actual room temperature during heating operation. Therefore, we adjust the HVAC setpoint with an empirically based error compensation to maintain a reasonable level of thermal comfort. 5.4 Case 1: Cooling To evaluate the performance of the proposed framework under a cooling operation, we conducted an on-site cooling experiment. The room temperature and the HVAC energy/power consumption were experimentally verified 16 times from September 10 to October 3, 2022. The thermal comfort requirement for maintaining a room temperature of 20 °C was set from 7:00 a.m. to 18:00 p.m. To meet this requirement, in the experiment using rule-based control (RBC), the HVAC was set at its cooling mode and operated from 7:00 a.m. to 18:00 p.m. with a temperature setpoint of 20 °C. In the experiment using our proposed SR-based HVAC management framework, the operation time and the temperature setpoint were both determined by the proposed framework. For comparison, the RBC and proposed SR-based HVAC management frameworks were conducted on October 1 and September 28, 2022 for a 24-h period starting at midnight. The previously described SR-based MPC formulation was deployed on the edge server and operated the HVAC system. The temperature prediction function for the target room was extracted based on historical data (Eq. (16)): (16) T t + 1 i n = 0 . 866 ⋅ T t i n − 0 . 499 ⋅ D t + 3 . 545 , where T t i n and D t are the room temperature and the HVAC power consumption at current time-step t . Fig. 8 shows the cooling experiment results: (a) outdoor temperature, (b) room temperature and HVAC temperature setpoint, (c) power consumption of the HVAC outdoor units, and (d) the energy consumption, where the blue and red lines are the RBC and the SR-based framework carried out on October 1 and September 28. Table 4 compares HVAC\u2019s 30-min-averaged peak power consumption, total energy consumption, average outdoor temperature, and operation times for October 1 and September 28. Fig. 8(b) shows that the room temperature with the RBC strategy started to decrease at 7:00 a.m and reached 20 °C by 7:15. On the other hand, when the proposed framework was performed, the room temperature gently started to decrease from 5:15 a.m. to precool the target room and reached 20 °C at 6:30, indicating that the framework controlled the room temperature better for that given target period. It is important to note that the room temperature on September 28 does not strictly follow the required room temperature of 20 °C, but it remains within the specified comfort range. This deviation in temperature is attributed to the different setting of the weight parameter, ω . In the experiment conducted on September 28, ω was set to 0.9. This setting indicates our focus on minimizing total energy consumption instead of maximizing thermal comfort. As shown in Fig. 8(b) the HVAC temperature setpoint gradually changed from room temperature to the target temperature. This gradual reduction in the setpoint temperature prevents sudden changes in the HVAC outdoor unit instantaneous load, which could cause power peaks. The advance operation feature also enables the HVAC system to precool the target room, providing a comfortable environment for occupants upon arrival. As shown in Fig. 8(c), the HVAC power consumption with the proposed framework is limited to approximately 1.4 kW. However, RBC\u2019s power consumption reached 2.5 kW when HVAC began to operate. In Fig. 8(d), RBC\u2019s energy consumption rose sharply from 7:00 a.m. and continued to rise gradually until 18:00 p.m. In contrast, the energy consumption of the SR-based framework, shown by the areas in red, rose at a constant rate from 5:15 a.m.to 17:15 p.m. when operation was terminated. These two figures confirm that the proposed method suppressed the peak power demand and smoothed out the power demand ramp rate. As shown in Table 4, compared with RBC, SR\u2019S 30-min-average peak power demand was reduced by 1.1 kW and the total energy consumption was reduced by 10.5 kWh. Table 5 summarizes the experiment results for the entire cooling experiment period, including the 30-min-average peak power consumption, the total energy consumption, the daily averaged outdoor temperature, and the HVAC operation time. In the cooling experiment, the proposed framework reduced the energy consumption and operation time by a maximum of 10.5 kWh (49.3%) and 5.7 h for approximately the same outdoor temperature with energy consumption is the main consideration in the scheduling period (September 28 and October 1). With the SR-based HVAC management framework, the total energy consumption fell by 4.9% from 22.6 to 21.5 kWh, the peak power demand fell by 25.8% from 3.1 to 2.3 kW, and the operation time was reduced by 1.3 h on average compared to the traditional rule-based control. These cooling experiment results indicate that the SR-based HVAC management framework significantly reduced the peak power demand and slightly reduced the energy consumption in the cooling operation. In the cooling operation, the energy and power consumption reduction with the proposed framework in our scenarios are mainly driven by the following two factors: (1) the HVAC system is activated in the early morning when the outdoor temperature is relatively low. This strategy reduces the cooling load due to the smaller difference between indoor and outdoor temperatures; (2) the proposed framework using symbolic regression method to predict room temperature changes and MPC to predictive control HVAC. This predictive control mechanism can eliminate redundant operations and consequently reduce the total operation time. 5.5 Case 2: Heating To evaluate the proposed framework\u2019s performance under the heating operation, we conducted an on-site heating experiment. The room temperature and the HVAC energy/power consumption were experimentally verified 16 times from November 30, 2022 to February 9, 2023. The thermal comfort requirement was set to maintain the room temperature at 25 °C from 7:00 a.m. to 18:00 p.m. To meet this requirement, in the experiment using RBC, the HVAC was set to its heating mode and operated from 7:00 to 18:00 with a temperature setpoint of 25 °C. In the experiment with our proposed SR-based HVAC management framework, the operation time and temperature setpoint were both determined by the framework. Compassion experiments with RBC and the proposed SR-based HVAC management framework were conducted on December 7 and 8, 2022, from 0:00 to 24:00. The previously described SR-based MPC formulation was deployed on the edge server and operated the HVAC system. The temperature prediction function for the target room was extracted based on historical data, as shown in Eq. (17): (17) T t + 1 i n = 0 . 843 ⋅ T t i n + 0 . 333 ⋅ D t + 3 . 411 , where T i n and D t are the room temperature and the HVAC system power consumption at current time-step t . Fig. 9 shows the heating experiment results: (a) outdoor temperature, (b) room temperature and HVAC temperature setpoint, (c) power consumption of HVAC outdoor units, and (d) energy consumption, where the blue and red lines are the RBC and SR-based framework. Table 6 compares the 30-min-average peak power demand, the total energy consumption during the experiment, the average outdoor temperature, and HVAC\u2019s operation times from December 7 and 8. As seen in Fig. 9(b), the room temperature with the RBC strategy started to increase at 7:00 a.m. and reached 25 °C by 7:15. On the other hand, when the proposed framework was performed, the room temperature gently started to increase from 5:00 a.m. and reached 25 °C by 6:45. This confirms that the framework both controlled and satisfied the room temperature requirement for a given target period. As in the cooling experiment, the temperature setpoint gradually changed from room temperature to the target temperature, preventing sudden changes in the HVAC outdoor unit instantaneous load. In Fig. 9(c), the RBC strategy\u2019s HVAC power consumption was 6 kW at startup, although the proposed SR-based framework reached only 1.5 kW, and its maximum value did not exceed 4 kW and suppressed the peak power demand. In addition, the HVAC only operated in the morning between 5:19 and 10:37 with the proposed SR-based framework, which is significantly shorter than the RBC strategy. Moreover, as illustrated in Fig. 9(d), the total energy consumption in the case of RBC continued to increase from 7:00 to 18:00, as indicated by the blue field area, and the total energy consumption of the proposed SR-based framework shown by the red field area increased at a constant rate from 5:19 to 10:37 when the operation ended. Although no HVAC operation was performed after 10:37, the room temperature was maintained at 25 °C due to the presence of other heat sources in the room. As shown in Table 6, with the SR framework the total energy consumption was significantly reduced by 49.8% from 24.5 to 12.3 kWh, the 30-min-average peak power demand was reduced by 2.4 kW, and the operation time was reduced by 6.7 h, compared with RBC strategy. These results indicate that the proposed framework\u2019s heating operation significantly reduced the total energy consumption and the peak power demand. Table 7 summarizes the experiment results for the entire heating experiment period, including the 30-min-average peak power consumption, the total energy consumption, the daily averaged outdoor temperature, and the HVAC operation time. In the heating experiment, with the proposed framework the energy consumption and operation time fell by a maximum of 15.3 kWh (73.9%) and 9.2 h for approximately the same outdoor temperature (December 13 and January 14). The peak power demand fell by 35.1% from 5.7 to 3.7 kW, the total energy consumption fell by 30.2% from 23.8 to 16.6 kWh, and the operation time fell by an average of 5.1 h compared to the traditional rule-based control. These experiment results confirm that our framework significantly shortened the HVAC operation time and reduced the total energy consumption of winter heating operations. As mentioned in Section 5.1, the target room contains a number of computers that generate heat that is diffused into the room. The proposed data-driven HVAC energy management framework incorporates internal heat generation and ambient environment heat transfer, enabling both heat sources to contribute to maintaining the room temperature without requiring HVAC operation. As a result, the HVAC system can be terminated early, shortening its running time and significantly lowering the total energy consumption. This discovery provides new insights into reducing energy consumption for HVAC heating operations and can be extended to most office environments. During heating operations, the reduction in energy and power consumption achieved by our proposed framework in our scenarios is primarily attributed to the consideration and utilization of existing indoor heat sources. This strategy allows for the maintenance of comfortable temperatures without the need to activate the HVAC system. 6 Conclusion We proposed a data-driven online energy management framework for HVAC systems that can calculate optimized operation schedules to minimize both total energy consumption and peak power demand while maximizing thermal comfort. We evaluated framework\u2019s performance by implementing it in a laboratory in Japan, where is equivalent to a typical office space. Our on-site experiment demonstrated the suitability of symbolic regression to capture building thermodynamics featuring HVAC systems. An SR-based MPC overcomes the inaccurate temperature control problem of traditional gray-box-based methods and surpasses them in terms of control accuracy and response time. Our experimental results show that the total energy consumption of cooling and heating operations can be reduced by up to 49.3% and 73.9% and averages of 4.9% and 30.2%. The peak power demand can be lowered by up to 25.8% and 35.1% on average for cooling and heating operations without incurring any major capital expense. These on-site experiment results demonstrated our proposed framework can efficiently suppress peak power demand in both cooling and heating, reduce energy consumption in both cooling and heating under certain conditions. Our future work will address three major directions. First is a parameter tuning of symbolic regression. In this experiment, the symbolic regression requires more than one hour to obtain the solution by a high-performance server, and this is impractical for edge implementation. Second is an extension to multiple zones\u2019 support of this framework. In this experiment, the proposed framework only optimizes the single room, and multiple rooms\u2019 support is important for building-level energy management. The third is to integrate various estimation models such as occupancy, electric price, electric demand, etc. for more smart HVAC management. By incorporating these models, it is possible to develop a more comprehensive and intelligent HVAC management system that can respond to changes in the environment, occupancy, and energy prices.

        "dc:description": "The optimization of the operation of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems has gained considerable attention due to its energy conservation potential. Collecting various building operation data presents an opportunity to improve the efficiency of energy management and reduce consumption. In this paper, a data-driven online energy management framework is proposed for enhancing the effectiveness of HVAC systems and minimizing energy consumption. To streamline the modeling process and improve the accuracy of temperature estimation, our proposed framework adopts a symbolic regression approach to estimate building thermodynamics based on the collected data. It also formulates a model predictive control (MPC)-based HVAC scheduling strategy to optimize HVAC operations while maximizing thermal comfort and reducing energy consumption and peak power demand. We conducted on-site experiments to evaluate the proposed framework and demonstrated a notable reduction in total energy consumption in both HVAC cooling and heating operations: average reductions of 4.9% and 30.2%, and 49.3% and 73.9% for best cases in the on-site experiment under certain conditions. In the heating operation, the proposed data-driven HVAC management framework efficiently utilized indoor/outdoor heat generation to maintain comfortable temperature levels without activating the HVAC. Such effective utilization of heat sources shortened the HVAC runtimes and further reduced the total energy consumption. With the proposed framework, the average HVAC peak power demand fell by 25.8% and 35.1% during cooling and heating operations in the on-site experiment with certain scenarios. On-site experiment results demonstrated the proposed framework can efficiently suppress peak power demand, reduce energy consumption in both cooling and heating operation under certain conditions. The framework\u2019s data-driven approach provides an effective means of optimizing HVAC operations, reducing energy consumption, and improving the thermal comfort of the building\u2019s occupants.",
