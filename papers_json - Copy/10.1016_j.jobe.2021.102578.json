Introduction of a plug and play model predictive control to predict room temperatures Lars Junghans ∗ Deok-Oh Woo University of Michigan, 2000 Bonisteel Blvd, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA University of Michigan 2000 Bonisteel Blvd Ann Arbor MI 48109 USA University of Michigan, 2000 Bonisteel Blvd, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA ∗ Corresponding author. Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework that predicts future room conditions have been examined in the past. However, the technique in its current state has been found to have entry barriers for its use in real building environments because the implementation of physical room models into MPC control framework is time-consuming. Additionally, cost intensive expert knowledge is needed for its implementation. In this study, a \u201cPlug and Play\u201d MPC framework for building automation environments is introduced that predicts the room temperature, energy demand values and load values for the next day. The novelty of the MPC framework is its ability to calibrate to the physical environment in relatively short time periods (10 days) without providing previous information. A calibrated simulation model approach is combined with a rule-controlled filter and is integrated into the MPC framework. Results illustrate that the framework predicts a reliable range of data for the next day.

Various approaches to reducing greenhouse gas emissions have been studied. Because the built environment accounts for 40% of the industrialized society's total energy demand [1] and approximately 44% of the total material use, as well as roughly 20% of the total CO2 emission [2], improvements in the building sector have shown to be most economically beneficial to reduce greenhouse gas emissions [3]. Numerous strategies to reduce the energy demand of buildings have been examined. The integration of storage systems into building automation has been found to be effective in reducing the energy demand for heating and cooling. Thermal storage systems, in the form of building construction with a high heat capacity, have been widely used for night ventilation [4]. Also, thermal storages have been integrated successfully as part of energy-efficient heating and cooling strategies like Thermo-Active Building Systems (TABS) and radiant floor heating [5]. Thermal storage systems in buildings are especially effective when thermal energy is freely available or renewable energy can be used to \u201ccharge\u201d the thermal storage in periods when there is a surplus of energy production. This stored energy can be used at later periods when energy is needed [6]. However, the performance of storage systems in buildings depends on the accuracy of future energy demands prediction. Mistakenly stored thermal energy can cause thermal discomfort or increase heating and cooling energy demand due to a lack of future energy demand information. One example of the storage systems application is the use of cold external temperatures at night-time as a \u201cnight ventilation\u201d strategy by which internal thermal storage is passively cooled down to be used for the purpose of indoor cooling for the following day. However, if the next day's temperature is colder than expected, the night ventilation can cause thermal discomfort for the occupants. Similarly, unwanted results can occur in active systems like TABS or radiant floor heating systems. A building control system that provides predictions of the room temperatures for the following day can help to avoid unwanted control behavior [7]. Storage systems in buildings can be used more efficiently with the help of the model prediction-based control systems. Additionally, the integration of thermal energy storage of buildings into smart grid systems has a huge potential to reduce the overall energy demand [8]. This is because the thermal mass of buildings can work as a \u201cpeak-shaving\u201d that can delay a part of energy demand beyond the peak demand period, which in turn can lead to a contribution to a smart grid network [9]. Conventional rule-based control systems [10] and digital control systems, like the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller, are commonly implemented in modern buildings. However, these control strategies share one major limitation; they are not designed to consider predictions in future behavior [11]. In contrast to the PID controller, Model Predictive Control (MPC) determines the input signal for the system not only on the basis of the current states but also on the impact that the actions will have on the future states. Because MPC considers both current states and future states, it is suitable for anticipatory building automation that must respond to both dynamic indoor condition changes and the time-delay in heat transfer in advance [12]. Also, MPC can be the most effective control strategy for incorporating future disturbances like the impact of weather to anticipate the energy demands of a room or building [13]. Because of its ability to predict future behavior as well as incorporating future disturbances, the MPC strategy is regarded as the most effective control method in future building automation frameworks [10]. The predictive ability of MPC strategy arises from its analysis of historical data, and by which it then uses for predicting future behavior. A typical MPC strategy used in buildings has the following components: 1) a dynamic building model, 2) predictions of the main disturbances, and 3) performance criteria for future control. The basic formula of an MPC is a closed-loop cycle that consists of an objective function and control constraints [14]. At every control time-step, the objective function is formulated and solved in a way that meets the defined constraints. Several control input options are simulated with a dynamic model. The simulation results are evaluated under the objective function and constraints. This process is iterated until an optimal control input vector is found [5]. In classical MPC applications, a relatively short-term control horizon (<1 h) is preferred to deal with dynamic changes in the control of HVAC systems where a fast response is needed [13]. However, the short-term control horizon is not suitable for the applications with a slow response time like thermal storage systems; the process of heat transfer through the heavy construction layers is much slower and gradual. Instead, a longer control horizon is essential to deal with both the time-delay in heat transfer through the thermal storage systems and the indoor condition changes in advance. One of the challenges for the use of a MPC strategy in buildings is to find a suitable dynamic model type that meets all requirements for effective building automation. At first, the dynamic model needs to be robust and relatively accurate. An MPC is robust when the dynamic models\u2019 stability and the performance specifications are maintained for all possible disturbances and the predicted values are within a specified range [15]. Additionally, the model needs to be complex enough to calculate the control data [16]. Furthermore, these models should be fast in the calculation process to minimize computational time [17]. An initial application of the MPC started in the late 1970s in the process industries in chemical oil refineries. Recently, MPC has been studied intensively in the field of building technology because of its significant cost reduction in data processing. Previous research on MPC is mainly focused on HVAC system control [18\u201321] for energy demand savings, and indoor thermal comfort [22]. Also, MPC has proven to be the most suitable for smart grid technologies [23]. However, to the best of the author's knowledge, there are few studies in which MPC was applied for predicting the indoor conditions according to outdoor condition changes regarding the thermal or electric storage systems. The greatest potential of the proposed MPC system to reduce the overall heating and cooling energy demand is the effective management of thermal and electric storages. Advanced control strategies like a MPC framework can be easily integrated into microcontroller technologies that have sufficient computational power. Additionally, modern home automation systems have the capacity to integrate advanced control frameworks. Improvements are needed in the control of night ventilation strategies, free cooling strategies, thermo-active building systems, and radiant floor heating systems. These heating and cooling systems have in common that they require: 1) a prediction of the future demand to improve their efficiency and thermal comfort, and 2) slow response time of 6\u201312 h. The introduced framework addresses these needs. Even given the high potentials of using MPC for predicting the thermal behavior of the room, the technique in its current state has been found to have entry barriers for its use in real building environments [24]. Among several dynamic modeling approaches to MPC development, resistance-capacitance models (RC models) have been widely used frequently for MPC applications in buildings [25]. These models are based on the logic of electrical circuits. The thermal resistance, heat capacity, and heat sources/sinks are combined in a network of nodes. The thermal behaviors of rooms are then can be calculated by solving the RC model. However, the integration of RC models into the control environment is relatively challenging due to requiring in-depth knowledge in the building configuration and of its thermal behavior [24]. Another approach in developing a dynamic model for use in an MPC are machine learning techniques. Several research work have been conducted to develop MPC models for the prediction of the temperature by using an artificial neural network (ANN) logic [26\u201328]. An ANN can predict the physical behavior when the algorithm is trained with data measured in previous periods. Mba et al. [26] used an ANN to predict the room temperature and humidity for a building in a humid climate. Their algorithm was able to provide relatively accurate temperature values for the following day. However, the ANN needed a training period of 24 months. This long period is not feasible for practical use in a building [29]. Implementing the physical building dynamic model into the MPC control framework is typically the most time-consuming part of the initial design process [30] because each model needs to be designed for one specific room or building. The mathematical model has to predict room-specific physical conditions to provide necessary information for the control. Often, building-specific physical properties are not known which makes the definition of crucial parameter settings in the model more complicated. Additionally, the preparation of a proper dynamic model that meets the specific needs is very time-consuming and thus is therefore not economically feasible in a building control project. Significant time is required [30] to train those experts who can develop a dynamic model of MPC control systems [24]. Therefore, a \u201cplug-and-play\u201d MPC controller for generating a building dynamic model that can create a room or building-specific model automatically after a short observation time is currently obviously highly desirable. However, to the best of the author's knowledge, there are no such models exist up until recently. Killian and Kozek [24] maintain that this is probably the main reason why the use of MPC has not yet become broadly adopted. This paper introduces a \u201cplug-and-play\u201d MPC method that overcomes the entry barriers of the MPC technology and can predict room temperatures and energy demand levels in a reasonable observation period. The novel features are: 1) the easy implementation into a room without any need of room modeling or knowledge of physical properties, and 2) its fast calibration process which enables a reliable prediction of the room temperatures and energy demand after a relatively short data observation process. The outline of this paper is as follows: In Section 2, the methods of \u201cplug-and-play\u201d MPC development are explained. Section 3 demonstrates the results of the developed MPC method. Finally, Section 4 discusses and presents the performance of the MPC method. 2 Methodology As mentioned in Section 1, dynamic building models need to be developed to meet the criteria of an ideal \u201cPlug and Play\u201d MPC model. The most important features of this kind of model are the capability to \u201clearn\u201d about the physical properties of the thermal zone independently without extensive expert knowledge; it needs to do the data observation process for the \u201clearning\u201d in a relatively short time and the calculation process should be fast enough to ensure a reasonable computational time of the optimization process [17]. Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 show the workflow of the proposed MPC method. The proposed MPC model has an observation time-period, where the control framework \u201clearns\u201d the initially unknown physically properties of the room. The observation period is used to: 1) calibrate the \u201cPlug and Play\u201d room model by involving a curve fitting process and 2) define discrepancies in the measured and the predicted (weather forecast) or calculated (dynamic simulation) data. The discrepancies are used for the filtering process. The optimal parameter settings for the room model, which are defined in the calibration process, are used as settings to predict the room temperature. The filtering process is used to define divergences in the prediction process. This section presents the technical background of the MPC model and gives an overview of the weather prediction process. Additionally, it introduces a filtering process to reduce errors in the prediction process. 2.1 Dynamic model for MPC Dynamic models in MPC are classified in a white box, black box, or a grey box model regarding the way the model is built. White box models are using simulation tools that are based on detailed described physical principles to calculate the thermal dynamics and energy demand of a room or building. High fidelity response simulation models like Energy Plus, TRNSYS and ESP-r are used for this type of model. Measured data is often used to calibrate these models [31]. The implementation of these tools into a controller system is found to be time intensive and therefore not feasible [32]. Moreover, the use of these simulation models to solve the calibration problem of MPC is limited [33]. Black box models are based on an empirical approach. Statistical methods like linear regression or methods in machine learning are used to generate a prediction model. Black box models have been demonstrated to be fast responding [34]. However, these models need an extensive training process on a very specific environment like a room in. Therefore, black box models have limitations when it comes to the development of generalized models that can be used fast in the varieties of rooms and locations [13]. Grey box models are a good combination of the white-box and black-box models. Usually, Resistance-Capacitance (RC) models are used as MPC models to predict the physical values of a system. The parameters of the model are estimated by using historical measurements. Grey box models have been used in a variety of papers [35\u201337]. Grey Box models are proven to be the appropriate method to model the thermal response of a building [38]. Compared to the white box models, grey box models have the advantage that the calculation process is faster and the integration into the controller is simpler. Because of its advantages, a grey box model is used for the introduced MPC. Instead of using a conventional RC network model, the introduced model is based on a method called the \u201cClimate Surface\u201d. 2.2 Dynamic model climate surface A thermal dynamic calculation model called the \u201cClimate Surface\u201d [39] which is developed by Burmeister and Keller is used to calculate the free running temperature and the energy demand. The climate surface model was originally developed to illustrate the climate and room specific energy demand values in a single diagram. The power balance equation is used to calculate the free-running temperature. The power balance equation is derived to the three crucial parameters: the generalized loss factor K, the time constant (Tau), and the Gain to loss ratio (Gamma). The climate surface model is chosen as the dynamic calculation model because of its advantages in: 1) the description of the physical properties of a room in a small number of parameters, 2) it's fast calculating process, and 3) it's ability to calculate the free running temperature and energy demand in a single calculation process. The free running temperature is calculated by: (Eq.1) T i ( t ) = − C K ⋅ d T i ( t ) d t + T e ( t ) + G K ⋅ I ( t ) + 1 K ⋅ P i n t where T i is the free running room temperature, d T i ( t ) is the temperature difference to the previous time step, T e ( t ) is the external temperature, d t is the time interval, P i n t are the internal heat gains, and I ( t ) is the irradiation to the wall openings. The K value is formulated as: (Eq.2) K = 1 ∑ i A i ⋅ [ ∑ i A i ⋅ U i + n ⋅ V ⋅ ( c ⋅ ρ ) a i r 3600 ] where A i is the envelope area exposed to external, U i is the U-value of the construction, n is the air change rate, V is the volume of the room and c is the heat capacity. The G value is formulated as: (Eq.3) G = ∑ i A w i n d o w ⋅ g i ∑ i A e x t e r n a l where g i is the SHGC of the opening including the shading. The C value is formulated as: (Eq.4) C = c ⋅ ρ ⋅ d ⋅ A i n t e r n a l / A e x t e r n a l where A i n t e r n a l is the internal area of the room and d is the thickness of the construction layer that is considered as the internal thermal mass. The energy demand per time step is calculated by using the same parameters used in the calculation for the free running temperature. The equation: (Eq.5) E h e a t = ∫ t 1 t 2 P h e a t ⋅ d t = K ⋅ ∫ t 1 t 2 [ T m i n − T i ( t ) ] ⋅ d t (Eq.6) E c o o l = ∫ t 1 t 2 P c o o l ⋅ d t = K ⋅ ∫ t 1 t 2 [ T i ( t ) − T m a x ] ⋅ d t where P h e a t and P c o o l are the heating power and cooling power per time step. The Climate Surface model calculates the free running temperature and energy demand for a single thermal zone. A single building zone model has the advantage to keep the MPC model simple, flexible, and modular [40]. Another advantage of the Climate Surface model is its ability to calculate the energy demand according to occupant temperature preferences. Additionally, multi zone models are too complex to be implemented without expert knowledge [24]. Because of these reasons, the proposed MPC system is designed to provide predictions for a single thermal zone. In this way, the individual conditions of each room or zone like shading effects caused by neighboring buildings can be considered in its predictions. Another advantage of the \u201cClimate Surface\u201d model is the ability to identify heat flow effects of neighboring thermal zones [39]. 2.3 Room model A room model meeting the requirements of a \u201cPlug and Play\u201d MPC mode is needed. A range of parameter settings must be defined to describe the dimensions and the physical properties of the room. This range of parameter settings needs to be flexible enough to enable the model to find a \u201cbest fit\u201d to the real room in the \u201cobservation\u201d process of the MPC. The number of parameters of the room model should be as small as possible to reduce the complexity and the computation time of the model calibration process. At the same time, the number of parameters must be sufficient to capture all physical aspects of the room and thus to meet the requirements of the prediction process of the MPC. Table 1 shows the range of parameter settings of the room model. The wide range of the parameters reflects the possible setting for the single zone. The range is limited to rooms from 8 m2 to 40 m2 and a maximum height of 3.5 m. The parameters are defined according to the Climate Surface model in section 2.2: - The setting for the envelope area is given as a sum of all walls that are exposed to the external and includes the windows. - The definition of the U-value is the mean value of all surfaces that are part of the thermal envelope and therefore exposed to the external air. - The air change rate ACH describes the expected infiltration rate of the room. ACH1 is multiplied with a weighting factor that increases with increasing external wind velocities. - A schedule is controlling the infiltration rate of ACH. - The C \u2013value describes the internal thermal storage of the room. It includes the density, the thermal conductivity, the heat capacity and the area of the thermal storage. - The definition for the G values 1\u20134 is according to the Climate Surface model. It considers the solar heat transfer by the SHGC value of the glazing and the window area. A G value is calculated for the main four orientations. The U-value and the factors for the infiltration are incorporated into the K value for use in the Climate Surface model. The three values (K-value, C-value and G-value) are divided by the envelope area of the room (parameter 1) to meet the requirements of the Climate Surface model, as will be discussed in section 2.2 below. 2.4 Weather prediction The National Weather Service of the United States provides forecast values for the sky coverage, the temperature, the wind velocity, and the wind direction. The external temperature, the global solar radiation and the wind velocity are needed as input values to simulate the temperature of a room. These predicted values are given in 6- or 12 h increments. The predicted weather data for the next day is provided for the Airport in Ann Arbor/Michigan because it is the closest weather station to the site. 2.4.1 External temperature The weather forecast provides predicted minimal and maximal external temperatures for a day in the future. The data for the minimal and maximal temperature of the next day, as well the minimal temperature for the following day is used to create an external temperature curve. 2.4.2 Global radiation The weather forecast does not provide information about the predicted global radiation. The information for the predicted type of sky cover is used to generate the global solar radiation. It describes how much of the sky is expected to be covered by clouds. The global solar radiation is calculated by applying a curve fitting process on previously measured global radiation data. The measured data for days with the same type of predicted sky cover is taken into account. The parameters of the curve fitting process are 1. The time of the year, 2. The intensity of solar radiation, and 3. The time of maximum solar radiation during the day. 2.4.3 Wind velocity The wind velocity is needed to calculate the infiltration rate of the room. The expected sustained wind velocity for the predicted time-period is provided by the weather forecast. The weather forecast used in this study did not provide information about a range of predicted values or uncertainty values. However, uncertainties in the weather forecast must be considered to provide a reliable predicted range of the room temperatures and the energy demand. The MPC model uses historical data in a filtering process to calculate uncertainty values (Section 2.5). 2.4.4 Calculation and calibration process The \u201cplug and play\u201d MPC model uses a calibration process to find the geometrical and physical properties of the room to be controlled. The calibration process is done by a curve fitting process, where previously measured room temperatures are used to find the best parameter settings for the room model (Section 2.3). A good fit is a good correlation between the calculated and the previously measured temperature curves. In this study, the means squared error process is chosen as a fitting criterion. Optimal parameter settings of the room model need to be defined in order to reliably predict an accurate range of room temperatures. In an iterative optimization process, the room temperature is calculated with varying parameter settings of the room model until the optimal combination of parameter settings is formed. As is evident, this approach does not involve a numerical optimization approach because the MPC model is based on simulations. Additionally, a numerical solution for the optimization problem is not feasible because of the characteristics of the calculation Climate Surface model which uses interdependant parameter settings. A genetic algorithm (GA) provides reliable, near optimal solutions and has the advantage of keeping the number of iterations relatively small [41]. The genetic algorithm has been used successfully for tuning the parameters of the controllers [42,43]. The genetic algorithm is used for the optimization process in this study because it can reliably optimize problems with interdependent parameters. The optimization process is constructed as a mean squared error MSE minimizer. The MSE process is applied to the average temperature difference between the measured temperature and the simulated temperature. The curve fitting process is applied to all measured data points of the observation time period (10 days). 2.5 Filter The calibration process is able to define parameter settings of the calculation model that provide temperatures close to those in the real room. However, errors and deviations in the form of differences between the measured and predicted room temperatures do occur. These errors are a result of measuring errors or uncertainties in the model definition. These errors need to be accounted for to predict a reliable room temperature range. One way to consider errors and deviations in a prediction model is to use filters. The purpose of a filter is to find a reliable range of predicted data by analyzing measured data. One filter that is often used for MPC applications with uncertain information in a dynamic system is the Kalman Filter. Its purpose is to reduce statistical noise in the measured data and estimate unknown data in a dynamic control process. It uses information of previous measurements and estimates future outcomes by using statistical principles. Kalman filters have been successfully integrated into MPC in buildings for improving the control of HVAC systems [44]. Conventionally, the Kalman filter uses statistical equations to solve the problem. Because of the dynamic calculation model in the introduced MPC framework and the characteristic data of the weather forecast, the Kalman filter cannot be used in this MPC in that conventional way. However, its strategies to improve the outcome of MPC by analyzing deviations between calculated and measured data can be used in this study. A rule-based filtering strategy is developed to handle input values with uncertainties in the MPC model. Maximum likelihood statistics is used to maximise the probability of the output. The filter analyzes the deviations between the measured data, the calculated data and the data provided by the weather forecast. Fig. 3 shows how this rule-based filter is organized. Two deviations and data with uncertainty are considered: 1) discrepancies between measured external weather data and the weather forecast, and 2) discrepancies between calculated and measured internal room conditions. Both discrepancy values are recorded for each day in the observation time-period. The discrepancies between the calculated and measured room temperature is added or subtracted to the calculated temperature to create an \u201cadjusted\u201d calculated room temperature. Three scenarios are established for the prediction of the room temperature range. The calculations for the \u201cnormal\u201d scenario ignore the uncertainties produced by the filter. It is using the data provided by the calibration process and the weather forecast. It is calculated by using the data provided by the weather forecast and room parameter settings delivered by the optimization process (shown in Section 2.4). The \u201cmaximal\u201d scenario is intended to provide information about the maximal expected room temperatures. It involves the maximal deviation in weather data prediction and room temperature calculations above the \u201cnormal\u201d scenario. The \u201cminimal\u201d scenario considers those deviations below the \u201cnormal\u201d scenario. 2.5.1 Discrepancies in real and predicted weather data The data provided from the weather forecast service can differ from the weather at the location of the building or room of interest for a variety of reasons. Surrounding buildings, local heat sources and differing wind conditions can influence the temperature, wind velocity and solar radiation at the location of the building. In the filtering process, the temperature, solar radiation, and average wind velocity are measured locally every 10 min at the building. This data is automatically compared to the predicted data that was provided by the weather forecast service. Differences between these data are recorded in order to predict potential differences in the prediction process. Each day of the observation period is considered for the analysis. A statistical predictive interval with a confidence interval of 95% s considered for the extreme scenario for the prediction process. It is calculated by considering the maximal temperature difference above and below the actual measured temperature. In this study, the observation time is 10 days. 2.5.2 Discrepancies between measured and calculated room temperatures Although the optimization algorithm in the calibration process (section 2.3) is intended to find the best physical and dimensional properties of the room model, discrepancies between the measured and calculated room temperatures cannot be avoided. These discrepancies between the actual and the predicted temperatures need to be considered in the prediction process. Discrepancies between the calculated and the measured room temperatures are recorded for each maximum and each minimum of the measured temperature at each day of the observation period. An expected deviation in room temperature is derived for the prediction process of the MPC. This deviation is added to or subtracted from the calculated room temperature of the prediction process. In this way, errors produced by the dynamic calculation model can be considered. The final product is a range of predicted temperatures for each time step of the calculation process (every 10 min). 2.6 Test environment and measurements A full-scale building is taken as a test environment. The building is located in the campus in Ann Arbor/United States (Fig. 4 ). The building has a single zone (with one bathroom) and a total floor area of 12.4 m2 and an indoor space volume of 32.2 m3. The building envelope has an average U-value of 0.46 W/m2K. A series of experiments were conducted in the building (Fig. 4) to measure the room air temperature, external air temperature, global radiation, and wind velocity locally (in November 2017, April, and May 2018). Fig. 5 shows the experimental equipment setting inside the test building. K-type wire thermocouples (accuracy of ±2 °C) were used for room and external air temperature measurement. The thermocouples were always calibrated with ice water before being placed on the measuring points. SP-110-SS pyranometer (accuracy of ±5%) was used for global radiation measurement and an anemometer (±1 m/s) was used for wind velocity measurement. The measured data were taken at 10-min intervals. Predictions are made every 24 h (7 p.m. each day). This time interval differs from those conventionally used in MPC processes. 2.7 Evaluation criteria for the predicting result An evaluation criterion for the outcome of the proposed MPC prediction needs to be defined so that its outcome is useful for the control of the room. As noted in section 2.2, the MPC logic in this work provides a range of predicted temperatures and energy demand values rather than a fixed predicted temperature or energy value. The outcome does not provide probability values because necessary probability numbers do not exist for the input values. Therefore, the building management system that controls thermal storage needs to rely on the minimum and maximum of the temperature range of the prediction. A challenge for the decision-making process occurs in cases where the predicted temperature range is above and below the comfort field at the same time. Night ventilation, free cooling and radiant cooling slabs are effective strategies in the cooling season when room temperatures are expected to be above the comfort field [45]. The threshold value for the activation of these systems depends on the thermal properties of the room, the climate, and the user behavior. There is no universal definition of a threshold value that can be used for all possible room conditions. Goal of the building control of these systems is to avoid discomfort and increased energy demand because of a \u201cfalse\u201d decision. The proposed MPC control, the above-mentioned cooling strategies are not activated when the MPC predicts a temperature range with a maximum and minimum above and below the comfort field at the same time. A similar strategy is used for the heating systems. The slow responding radiant floor heating should be activated when there is a demand for heating and there is no risk of providing heat without any demand for its operation. The predicted energy demand value is used for the decision process of the building management system. It can be used to define how much the storage will be charged. 3 Results 3.1 Results for the predicted room temperatures Figs. 6\u20138 illustrate the results of the room temperature predictions for April and May 2018, as well as those for November 2017. Each diagram shows the measured, calculated, and adjusted room temperature for the data observation period of 10 days. The adjusted temperature is the simulated temperature after the filtering process. The figure also shows the predicted room temperature range for the next day. The measured room temperature of the predicted next day is shown for comparison. The results for April (Fig. 6) show that the calculated temperatures are relatively close to the measured temperatures. Differences of up to 3.2 K are observed. The discrepancies are most common at the daily minimums. In most, but not all cases, the calculated temperatures are higher than the actual temperatures. This illustrates that the calibration process is able to find parameter settings that represent physical properties very close to those of the real room. It also shows the importance of the filtering process (section 2.5), which reduces the discrepancies between the calculated and measured temperatures. The filtering process reduces these temperature differences to a minimum. The adjustment of the calculated temperature provides a room temperature that is representing the measured temperatures in a satisfying way. The results for the free running temperature predictions in April are demonstrating that the predicted room temperature range covers the measured temperature. The calculated temperature without considering the filtering process is relatively close to the measured temperature at night. At daytime, the calculated temperature is with a temperature difference of maximal 2.8 K below the measured temperature. The upper range of the adjusted temperature after the filtering process do cover measured room temperatures. The temperature range between the minimal and maximal predicted temperature is 6.2 K. Fig. 7 shows the calculation results for May. Similar to the calculations in April, the calculated temperatures are higher than the measured temperatures most of the times. The room temperatures can be well adjusted with the filtering process. The result of the predicted temperature range shows that it covers the measured room temperature. The predicted temperature range is significantly narrower compared to the predictions for April. Fig. 8 shows the calculated temperatures for November. On November 11, 12 and 13 the calculated temperatures are with 6.5 K significantly higher than the measured room temperatures. On Nov. 14, the calculated temperatures are below the measured temperatures. The filtering process is able to adjust the temperature. The predicted temperature range covers the measured room temperature. The range of the temperatures is relatively wide compared to the results in April and May. The relatively wide temperature range is caused by large differences of the predicted external temperature provided by the weather forecast and the measured external temperatures at the location. To illustrate the accuracy at the three predicted time periods in April, May and November (Figs. 6\u20138), the Mean Squared Error (MSE) has been calculated. The MSE is calculated for the difference between the measured room temperature and the predicted temperature range. It is calculated for the temperature difference in all measured time steps. The MSE is equal to zero as long the measured room temperature is inside the predicted room temperature range. The average MSE has been zero for the three time periods in this study. The room temperatures have been predicted for a 14 day period in April through May in 2018. For each day, the adaptive model predictive control principles (section 2) are used. Predictions have been done on the previous day at 7 p.m. The chosen time-period shows very cold days with external temperatures of minimal −0.5 °C, and very hot days of external temperatures of 35.2 °C just two days later. Fig. 9 shows the predicted room temperature range for every day. It also shows the measured external and room temperature. The results show that the model predictive control is providing relatively accurate predictions for the room temperature range. The measured room temperatures are below the predicted temperature range in the evening hours. On April 21st, 23rd, and 27th, the measured room temperatures are slightly below the predicted temperature range. However, the differences between the predicted and measured temperatures are small. The MSE has been calculated for every measured and predicted time step of the 14 day period in April (Fig. 9). The average MSE for this time period is 0.41. Therefore, the predicted temperature ranges can be described as to be accurate. 3.2 Predictions for energy demand and load Predictions for the energy demand and the maximal power for heating and cooling have been calculated for the predicted day. The predicted free running temperature in section 2.2 have been used for the calculation. Table 2 shows the calculation results for the predicted days in April, May, and November. The energy demand is provided in Wh for the predicted time period of one day. The classification of \u201cMaximal\u201d,\u201cNormal\u201d and \u201cMinimal\u201d refers to the predicted temperature range that is provided by the filtering process (section 2.5). Like expected, higher room temperatures are resulting in lower heating energy demand values and lower heating power values. No cooling energy demand have been calculated because the predicted room temperatures are below the maximal set point temperature of 26 °C . 3.3 Results for the parameter settings The results of the calibration process are presented in section 3.1. The length of the observation process can have an influence on the accuracy of the calibration process and on the definition of the discrepancies for the filtering process. Section 3.2 shows how much the length of the observation time influences the prediction process. Table 3 (parameters) shows the results for the parameter settings on the basis of the optimization process for November, April and May. It also shows a comparison between the optimized parameter settings derived from the optimization process and the values of the test room. The table illustrates the good fit between the values. Because the calculation model used in this study is an \u201cabstract\u201d description of the room (section 2.3), the optimal calculated parameter settings can differ from these of the real room. The goal is to find the optimal parameter settings with the smallest differences between the calculated and the measured room temperature. However, it is not possible to find settings that are identical to the geometrical and physical properties of the room. The results for November (75 m2), April (65 m2) and May (80 m2) show that the parameter settings found by the optimization process for the envelope area are smaller to those of the test room (90.16 m2). The room volume calculated by the curve fitting process is higher for November (75 m3) and May (60 m3) than that of the real test building. For April, the calculation result is with 40 m3 very close to that of the test room. The optimization process suggests an U-value of 0.6 W/m2K for the building envelope for November and of 0.5 W/m2K for April and May. These values are very close to those of the test room (0.48 W/m2K). The optimal setting of the fixed air change rate (ACH 1) ranges from 0.05 (May) and 0.2 (in November). The optimal setting for ACH 2 (air change depending on wind velocity) is between 0.4 (in April) and 0.7 (in November and May). The optimization process was able to recognize that the test room has a light construction. Optimal results for the G-values indicate where the test room has smaller or larger windows. G-value 1 (north oriented façade) and G-value 2 (south oriented facade) have relatively high settings for April and May comparable to the values of the test room. G-value 2 is smaller for the run in November than for those in the run in April and May. The reason for the smaller value is that the sun is lower in November. The test room is surrounded by buildings that provide shading on the south oriented façade at lower sun altitude angles in the winter. The \u201cabstract\u201d G value of the Climate Surface model combines the SHGC of the glazing, the window size, and any kind of shading in a single value. The surrounding buildings do not affect the south façade in April and May. The calibration process found an orientation angle of 15° (15° shift to the east from the south orientation) for the test run in November. The shift was −15° in April and 45° in May. 3.4 Effect of the observation time-period The duration of the observation time can have an influence on the accuracy of the prediction process. The optimal duration time is defined by calculating the MSE and the average temperature difference between the predicted and measured. Fig. 10 shows the MSE between the calculated room temperature as the \u201cnormal\u201d value (section 2.5) and the measured data. The MSE is given for a variety of observation time periods. It is calculated for the same prediction day for all durations. The calculation process does not include the filtering process (section 2.5). The calculation is done to evaluate the effect of the duration of the observation time on the accuracy of the predicted room temperatures. The calculation is done for three time periods where test run 1 was performed in November (2nd to 19th), test run 2 was performed in April (11th to 30th), and test run 3 in May (1st to 19th). Fig. 11 shows the MSE between the \u201cminimal\u201d or \u201cmaximal\u201d value (section 2.5) of the predicted room temperature range and the measured data. The MSE is given for an observation time period of 2\u201316 days. The MSE calculation in Fig. 11 includes the filtering process (section 2.5). The results of Figs. 10 and 11 illustrate that the MSE decreases with an increasing number of observation days. For all three periods, the MSE is relatively high when the observation time-period is relatively short (2\u20133 days). The duration of 4\u20137 days shows inconsistent MSE values. Fig. 11 shows that the MSE is significantly smaller when it is calculated on the predicted temperature range instead of the predicted \u201cnormal\u201d temperature. The results indicate that an observation period of at least 8\u20139 days are needed to provide a consistently small MSE. Fig. 12 shows the average temperature differences between the predicted external temperatures provided by the weather forecast and measured local external temperature. As in Fig. 12, the data is illustrated for the minimal and maximal temperature of the day. The average difference between the weather forecast and the measured temperatures does not decrease with a longer observation period. The measured temperatures are significantly higher than the predicted temperatures of the forecast. Also, the average temperature differences are higher for the cases where the measured temperatures are higher than the temperatures of the forecast (>measured). The diagram shows that the locally measured temperatures are above the predicted temperatures of the weather forecast in most cases. The local temperatures at the test building are significantly higher than these predicted by the weather forecast, irrespective of the duration of the observation. This demonstrates that the filtering system (section 2.5) is a necessity to define the predicted temperature range. There is a large temperature difference between the forecasted and the actual temperature for both, the maximal and the minimal temperature of more than 12 °C on day 5. This unusually high temperature difference demonstrates that uncertainties in the weather forecast are critical for the predicting process must be addressed in the filtering system. 4 Discussion conclusion This study proposes a Model Predictive Control framework that predicts the free running room temperature and energy demand for a predicted time horizon of one day. The novelty of the proposed model is its ability to be used as a \u2018plug and play\u2019 device that does not need expert knowledge for its integration into a building automation environment. The observation time-period for the model calibration process was 10 days. The predicted room temperatures have been compared to measured data. The influence of the duration of the observation period on the accuracy of the prediction process have been analyzed. The control framework was tested in a full-scale test room for three 10-day periods in November 2017, April 2018, and May 2018. Both model calculations and measurements indicate that the proposed framework is able to reliably and accurately predict room temperatures for a prediction horizon of one day. The MSE for the test runs at three predicted days in April, May and November have been zero. For a longer predicted time period of 14 days in April, the MSE has been very small (0.41). The results for the test data illustrates that the proposed MPC framework predicts room temperature accurately. The control framework can be used as a Plug and Play tool because it finds the geometrical and physical properties of a room in the relatively short observation time without any user input. Therefore, the proposed framework is able to overcome the entry barriers of the MPC technology for room temperature predictions. The results also indicate that the MPC framework provides reliable temperature predictions with a relatively short data observation period of 10 days. A shorter observation time would increase the risk of defining model parameter settings that do not actually represent the properties of the observed room. The proposed framework involves a calculation process of 20 min. The length of the calculation process results from a dynamic calculation process (with its 1440 time-steps). Additionally, the process requires an optimization process in its data calibration. Because the calibration process is long, the method is best suited to control applications that permit relatively long response times, such as the predicting of thermal storage systems. While Sturzenegger et al. [30] have argued that the calibrated simulation model approach is not effective for implementation into controllers their work is not specifically discussing applications of this sort. Instead, their work involves \u201creal time\u201d control applications where an instant response is needed. Thus, while their research offers many valuable insights, it does not directly bear on the feasibility of MPC applications with long response times. The greatest resource of uncertainty in the prediction process is the data provided by the weather forecast services. The data provided by the weather forecast service is the highest uncertainty factor in the prediction process. The locally measured external temperature has been higher than the forecasted temperatures in most cases. While the resulting uncertainties in the prediction process cannot be avoided, the predicted temperature range is precise enough to be a strong indicator of the expected room temperatures for the next day. This tendency can be used as a predictive tool for integrating into a building automation process. The implementation of the filter process is important and increases the accuracy of the predicted temperature range.
