Multi-user heating buildings based on demand-side adjustment have substantial potential in terms of energy savings and heat efficiency. The former heating system is generally controlled by considering the heating building as a whole. However, the original adjustment method is difficult to apply when there are several independent heat demand users in the building. In this background, this study established a hydrothermal coupled multi-level control model of a multi-user building heating system according to the actual situation of a multi-user heating building. In addition, it investigated the adjustment characteristics between user and building to effectively control the system. The results showed that the adjustment mode has a negligible effect on the room temperature and energy consumption for radiant floor heating systems and radiator heating systems. The control period had a large influence on the adjustment of the multi-user building heating system. The response time of the radiant floor heating system was over 4 h and that of the radiator system was less than 30 min. When the average indoor temperature reduced by 1 ℃, the energy-savings rate of the radiant floor heating system increased by 8.6 %, and that of the radiator heating system increased by 6.7 %. This study provides a basis for formulating and implementing control strategies in multi-user building heating systems.

Compared with other sectors such as transportation and industry, buildings are primary energy consumers and account for approximately 30 % of the national total energy consumption [1]. District heating accounts for approximately 40 % of the building energy consumption [2,3]. Many scholars have conducted in-depth studies on system energy savings and emission reduction methods [4\u20136]. However, these studies are not applicable to all heating problems. The overheating loss caused by the mismatch between central heating supply and demand in China has accounted for 23% of the total heat consumption [7]. The balance of supply and demand has become an important factor affecting the reduction of CO2 emissions and achievement of carbon neutrality in heating systems. Demand side management (DSM) is one of the most effective methods to solve the mismatch between supply and demand. It is widely used in power systems [8]. Unlike the direct transmission of electricity, in district heating systems, heat can only be transferred indirectly to the heat demand side through thermal medium transmission [9]. Demand side users have significantly less control over heating than they have over electricity. Therefore, most of the research on DSM is carried out through demand side regulation. Zheng [10] developed an intermittent adjustment method using a heating pipe network as a heat accumulator to optimize the start and stop times. Cai [11] developed a network-level demand-side regulation suitable for urban district heating, with user comfort, thermal market, and network congestion as the main features. In references [12] and [13], a gray box model of the control of a large district heating system was established based on the characteristic parameters of the heating pipe network. It was used in the simulation of urban sizing control in DSM. Ding [14] proposed an improved multi-objective control method for campus buildings with three optimization targets. Guelpa [15] studied the development of temperature difference control strategy for heat exchangers. In addition, many studies specifically addressed the implementation of demand-side regulation. Lu [16] developed a spatial model of a state-space model of a variable-flow radiant heating system and compared the difference between model prediction control and proportional-integral-derivative control. Buonomano [17] constructed an adaptive temperature control model with certain robustness. It satisfies the indoor temperature and humidity requirements. In [18], a model of a radiator heating system in public buildings was established. Furthermore, the adjustment strategy of TRNSYS was optimized by GenOpt. Brandi [19] conducted a control experiment with a deep reinforcement learning method in a single-user office building. With adequate data collection, the approach achieved system energy savings of 5 %\u201312 %. Fig. 1 illustrates a typical heating system. Multi-user building refers to a heating building with multiple independent heating subjects. Each heating subject is considered a separate control body controlled by the device at the user's place and the building's heating entry. It can be observed that many of the studies on demand side regulation were on first-degree heating network systems [10\u201313], secondary network systems [14,15,18,20], and single-user building heating systems [16,17,19]. Few of these were on MBHSs. The main reason is that the hydrothermal coupling between users in an MBHS results in complexity of the entire system adjustment. The relatively small number of multi-user buildings in Europe and North America [21,22], and the conventional source-side adjustment of heating systems in China [23,24] are also likely causes. At present, the few studies on the demand side regulation of multi-user building heating systems are mainly on the hydraulic decoupling of a user by a differential pressure valve, followed by the adjustment of the independent user [25\u201327] or few users with an equal differential pressure area [28\u201330]. Here, the focus is on the adjustment method to one user. Zhang [25] studied the operation control effect of an MBHS after installing an automatic balancing valve in all the users\u2019 radiators. Liu [28] decoupled the MBHS, developed a multi-user hydrothermal coupling model of a single-story area, and compared the energy-saving effects of different control methods. However, in the general MBHS, it is difficult to achieve hydraulic decoupling for all users. Moreover, the entire adjustment of the system is realized through user and building thermal inlet adjustment. Under the condition of incomplete decoupling, the process of an MBHS includes three coupling relationships: hydraulic coupling caused by heating network, thermal coupling caused by building heat conduction, and regulatory coupling between user-level and building-level. Correspondingly, the control method of a single-user building is difficult to apply to MBHSs. The existence of the three coupling relationships significantly complicates the adjustment of an MBHS in theoretical analysis. Furthermore, the actual system is deficient in relevant test data. Therefore, new control modes and more guidance are required for MBHSs. A hydrothermal coupling MBHS control model incorporating two forms of heating (radiant floor heating and radiator heating) was developed to address the research deficiency mentioned above. Furthermore, the adjustment characteristics of the systems under demand-side regulation were studied. The following are the main originalities of this study compared with previous ones: (1) A multi-stage control model of hydrothermal coupling multi-user building heating systems was established. It fully considered the hydraulic coupling, thermal coupling, and control coupling between the building and users, and could more accurately reflect the actual situation of the building and user in the course of the MBHS. (2) The control modes of the isochronous mode and anisochronous mode were proposed to describe the control relationship between the entire building and users in multi-user building heating systems. In addition, the characteristics of the control mode and the adjustment period of radiant floor heating system and radiator heating system in multi-user buildings were studied. This provided the basis for the formulation of the MBHS adjustment strategy. (3) The temperature distribution and energy consumption of multi-user heating buildings with different heating systems were studied under demand-side adjustment. This provided reference for the selection of control parameters and analysis of control effects for multi-user building heating systems. In Section 2, the basic model method is introduced. This includes the basic information of a multi-user building heating system, process of model development and verification, simplified method, and supplementary model information. In Section 3, the control method of a multi-user building heating system is analyzed, and the system control model is established based on the basic model. In Section 4, the influence of the adjustment period and adjustment mode on the system regulation is analyzed. In addition, the regulation characteristics of different types of multi-user building heating systems are studied. In Section 6, conclusions are presented. 2 Model method 2.1 Information on building heating system 2.1.1 Building system The investigated building is a typical residential building located in Harbin. It was completed in 2014. This building has a total gross floor area of 11,144 m2. It has 16 floors, and each floor includes nine users and three separate stairwells. The heating system for this residential building is radiant floor heating. During the non-heating season of 2019, the heating company installed conditioning units before each user's thermal inlets. This enabled them to adjust their indoor heat input. The entire building on both sides of symmetry, symmetrical rooms had an equal floor area and identical building form. A standard floor of the building is shown in Fig. 2 . Here, the numbers 01\u201309 indicate the residential users, and S1\u2013S3 indicate the stairwells. Various types of concrete and insulation materials were used in the construction. The properties of each layer and composition of the envelopes are disaggregated in Table 1 . The active layer in the envelope was the heating equipment of the radiant floor system, which only in the residential users. Details of the active layer are listed in Table 2 . 2.1.2 Hydraulic system In terms of the hydraulic system, the entire building consists of three units, each divided into a high area (12F\u201316F) and low area (1F\u201311F) element. The hydraulic system was divided into six subsystems: Low_1, Low_2, Low_3, High_1, High_2, and High_3. The subsystem partition of the hydraulic system is shown in Fig. 3 . Each hydraulic subsystem was a double tube system. The supply network was symmetrical with the return network. The structure of the pipe network of the hydraulic system in High_1 is shown in Fig. 4 as an example. 2.2 Basic model development The model satisfied the following assumptions during the simulation: (1) The heat media is a homogeneous one-dimensional incompressible fluid with zero volume expansion coefficient. (2) The heat medium conduction and energy dissipation along the pipeline are relatively weak compared with the heat transported. These terms can be omitted. The entire building heating system model was established by TRNSYS18 software. According to the actual situation of the building, a geometric model was constructed in Sketchup software to distinguish the corresponding thermal zones and generate the corresponding geometric information file. The file was imported into the Type56 module to form the base thermal module of the building system. Other parameters (lighting, electrical equipment, people, ventilation, etc.) of the users were set according to the unified specification standard index [31,32]. Those values were input into the overall system model through the Type56 module. Then, the spatial pipe network hydraulic calculation module was constructed and compiled by Visual Studio 2019 to generate a DLL file that can be called by TRNSYS18. Finally, the functional modules were connected in TRNSYS Studio, and climate parameters, pipe network information parameters, and other parameters present in the system were input to form a complete thermo-hydraulic coupling building heating system model. Fig. 5 shows the overall approach to developing the system model. Further details on the development processes and modeling methods were described in the literature [33]. 2.3 Basic model validation and calibration The normalized mean bias error (NMBE) and the coefficient of variation of the root mean square error (CvRMSE) were used to quantify the deviation between the simulation and measurement. NMBE indicates the overall bias of the model, and CvRMSE indicates the accuracy [34]: (1) N M B E % = ∑ i = 1 n M i - S i ∑ i = 1 n M i × 100 (2) C v R M S E % = ∑ i = 1 n M i - S i 2 n ∑ i = 1 n M i n × 100 M i and S i are the hourly measured value and hourly simulated value, respectively, of a parameter to be verified. The model was validated hourly for standard variation. The maximum values of each standard variation were 10 % (NMBE) and 30 % (CvRMSE) [35,36]. The validation data was building data measured during the period from 10/20/2019 to 04/20/2020. The indoor temperature and heating consumption of 144 users were used as validation parameters. The infiltration rates and thermal resistance increased by the fouling of the buried pipes of users were used as calibration parameters. The calibration and validation of basic models was complex. These are discussed in detail in the literature [33]. The results of the calibrated model validation are shown in Figs. 6 and 7 . Comparisons between the measurements and simulation values for a typical user are shown in Fig. 8 . 2.4 Basic model simplification and supplementary 2.4.1 Model simplification method For an ordinary multi-user heating building, the users can be classified according to the location of different buildings. In the vertical direction, the building users could be divided into roof users, middle users, and ground users. In the horizontal direction, they could be divided into side users and intermediate users. The users located on the roof-side and ground-side of the building (whose external envelope structure is of the largest proportion) are the least favorable users of the building heating system. Other users located at the roof, ground, and side of the building (whose proportion of the external envelope structure area is less than that of the most unfavorable users) are unfavorable users. The users located in the middle are ordinary users. Their proportion of the external envelope structure area is the smallest. A complete multi-user building heating system needs to address all the locations and all types of users. Fig. 9 shows the breakdown of the different user categories in the building heating system. The original model constructed in this study contains an excessive number of users of the same type. Moreover, the complexity of the calculation process necessitates a long time. Therefore, this study simplified the original model to reduce the number of same type of heat users. The heating system of the original building contains six relatively independent hydraulic subsystems. The hydraulic conditions of users between different hydraulic subsystems do not affect each other. The results of the calibrated model validation are shown in Figs. 6 and 7. According to these results, the users in the High_1 area have the highest accuracy. It can also be observed that the High_1 area contains all the user types except for the ground. After the replacement of the bottom user in the High_1 area with the ground user, this study used the High_1 area as the simplified system model. In the original model, the right boundary of the High_1 area is the other normal heating users. When the High_1 area is selected as a simplified model, similar heating users are added to its right boundary. The simplification process and diagram of the system model are shown in Fig. 10 . The simplified model in this study can be regarded as the selection of building areas containing various types of users as a research object on the basis of the original model, which is sufficient to reflect the regulation characteristics in the original model. 2.4.2 Supplementary model The model of a radiator heating building system was incorporated in this study to investigate the demand-side adjustment characteristics of a building system more comprehensively. In the same type of residential building, the largest difference between the radiator heating system and radiant floor heating system lay in the structure of the floor. The radiator building system model and simplified model had identical hydraulic system, regulator, and calibration physical parameters. The envelope information of different thermo-physical parameters is shown in Table 3 . Radiators were selected according to the corresponding specification requirements [37]. These are element radiators made of cast iron. The characteristics of the selected radiator are listed in Table 4 . 3 Control model method Fig. 11 shows a schematic diagram of the MBHS. User control was achieved through the joint operation of a user adjustment device and building heating entry regulation device. Therefore, the entire process could be divided into user-level regulation (user's control device action) and building-level regulation (building heating entry control device role). Unlike the conventional single-user control, the process of the MBHS included three coupling relationships: hydraulic coupling, thermal coupling, and regulatory coupling. When the single-user adjustment method was directly applied to each regulation body of an MBHS, there was a high likelihood of continuous oscillation of the entire system owing to the coupling relationship [38]. In this case, a periodic control method was the most effective means to prevent continuous oscillations. Thus, the overall regulation study of MBHS involved four aspects: the control method at the user-level, adjustment method at the building-level, control cycle selection, and relationship between the user regulation cycle and building control cycle. This study focused on two basic characteristics of regulation: adjustment period and control mode. 3.1 Control method The standard open-close adjustment was selected as the user-level control mode, and the actuator was the pump located at the building's thermal entrance for building-level heating regulation. The entire control method is shown in Fig. 12 . The regulation method of the building heating system was as follows: (1) The adjustment of a user-level valve was based on the indoor temperature of its corresponding dwelling unit at the regulation time. The valve was closed when the room temperature was above the target temperature set by the user, and opened when the room temperature was below or equal to the target temperature. Each user's adjusting behavior was independent of those of the others. (2) The control of the entire building-level heating system was based on the number of opened user-level valves. Suppose there were m users in the system, the system pump frequency increased by 5 Hz when the number of opened user-level valves was m at the adjusting time. The pump frequency decreased by 5 Hz when the number of valves opened in the system was at most 20 %m. The initial frequency of the pump was 50 Hz, and its frequency range was 35\u201350 Hz. 3.2 Regulation cycle The MBHS presented a strong hydraulically coupled effect between users. This indicated that the regulation of a user would affect a range of neighbors [39]. At this point, to satisfy the need for self-regulation, each user's valve was in constant motion. Periodic regulation is a common method to prevent hydraulic oscillation in the MBHS. In this study, time intervals that could divide a day into integer segments were selected as the adjustment period. The minimum adjustment period was 0.5 h, and the others were 1 h, 1.5 h, 2 h, 3 h, 4 h, 4.8 h, 6 h, 8 h, and 12 h. 3.3 Control mode It was important to discuss the temporal relationship between the users and building for this two-leveled, periodic regulating heating system. This relationship can be referred to as the control mode. It can be divided into the isochronous mode and anisochronous mode. Isochronous mode refers to the coincidence of the adjustment behavior of these two levels, whereas anisochronous mode refers to the half-period delay between users and the entire building. A schematic of the isochronous and anisochronous modes considering the adjustment period of 6 h as an example is shown in Fig. 13 . 3.4 Control model development The control parameters were set as flow rates at each user\u2019s thermal inlet and the building's thermal entrance. The radiant floor system's supply and return water temperatures were 45/35 ℃, and those of the radiator system were 75/50 ℃. The simulation period included two weeks wherein the outdoor temperature varied relatively marginally from the outdoor design temperature. The indoor design temperature of any dwelling unit in the building was 21 °C. The simplified basic models are developed in Section 2. The control model is similar to the hydraulic model and was compiled by Visual Studio 2019 as a DLL file and linked to TRNSYS18. Figs. 14 and 15 illustrate the radiator heating system control model and radiant floor heating system control model, respectively, developed by TRNSYS18. 4 Result and discussion 4.1 Indoor temperature The user's indoor temperature is one of the critical factors that affect the control system's performance. It is necessary to pay attention to the indoor temperature of all the users in the process of building adjustment. 4.1.1 Variations in user indoor temperature during adjustment Figs. 16 and 17 show the indoor temperature of the radiant floor heating system and radiator heating system, respectively, of randomly selected users under different control states. In those figures, R represents the radiator heating system; F represents the radiant floor heating system; BASE represents the baseline working condition without adjustment; A represents the anisochronous mode; and 0.5 h, 4 h, and 12 h represent the selected regulation cycles. According to Fig. 16, the indoor temperature of the radiant floor heating system presented a more significant fluctuation (3.1 ℃\u20133.9 ℃) under different control modes, compared with the baseline case with the minimum fluctuation. However, the overall trend of the indoor temperature under each control mode still had a distribution similar to that of the baseline. This result shows that the degree of indoor temperature regulation was limited at the user-level for the radiant floor heating system. It also indicates that it is difficult for the radiant floor heating system to achieve a desired constant temperature only by adjusting the user's valve without other auxiliary heating methods. Fig. 17 shows the user indoor temperature of the radiator heating system. The temperature fluctuated significantly around the target temperature under different control strategies. The range of indoor temperature fluctuation for the baseline condition was 3.2 ℃. The range of the fluctuation increased from 2.8 ℃ to 5.3 ℃ with the extension of the adjustment period. It is evident from this result that the regulation of the radiator heating system has a higher impact on the room temperature. Thereby, within a short control period, building users have the opportunity to maintain their indoor temperature fluctuation in a relatively small range. The above differences between these two systems were mainly caused by their heat transfer mechanism. The indoor air is mainly heated through radiation in the radiant floor heating system, and convection occupies only a small part. This type of heat transfer results in a system with large thermal inertia and relatively minimal response to the regulation. In the radiator heating system, the heat transfer between the radiator and the indoor air is also through radiation and convection. However, the ratio of the two does not differ significantly. Therefore, the radiator system has better adjustable characteristics than the radiant floor system. 4.1.2 Effect of the period of regulation Figs. 18 and 19 show the average indoor temperature of each user with different regulating periods and heating systems. The following is the temperature calculation method: (3) T mean\\_period _ n i = T m e a n _ A _ n i + T m e a n _ I _ n i 2 T mean\\_period _ n i denotes the average indoor temperature of user i that is being adjusted every n h, (℃); T m e a n \\_ A _ n i represents the average indoor temperature of user i with an anisochronous mode and n h as the control period, (℃); and T m e a n \\_ I _ n i represents the average indoor temperature of user i with an isochronous mode and n h as the control period (℃). As shown in Fig. 18, the average indoor temperature decreased marginally after the radiant floor heating system was adjusted. Compared with the baseline condition, the maximum temperature difference of adjusting conditions was 0.9 ℃. The average indoor temperature of users in different locations varied approximately identically with the adjustment period. When the system adjustment period was 0.5\u20134 h, the average indoor temperature of users remained close to 20.4 °C and did not vary with the adjustment period. The average indoor temperature of users fluctuated in a certain range when the system adjustment period was over 4 h. The users' average indoor temperature increased when the number of daily regulation cycles was odd, and decreased when the number of cycles was even. This result shows that the building with the floor radiation system has a high thermal inertia. The thermal response time of building users was over 4 h. Thereby, the average indoor temperature of the user in the building did not vary when the adjustment period was less than 4 h. Strategies with an odd number of daily cycles required more heat than those with an even number of daily cycles when the adjustment period exceeded 4 h. The highest and lowest average room temperatures had adjustment periods at 8 h and 12 h, with temperatures at 20.6 ℃ and 20.2 ℃, respectively. During the entire control process, the temperature of users in the top layer was lower than that of the other layers, whereas the temperature differences between the middle and bottom layers were not significant. All the users presented a similar temperature distribution with the regulation cycle. As shown in Fig. 19, when the radiator heating system was adjusted, the average indoor temperature of the user reduced more than that for the radiant floor heating system. Compared with the baseline condition, the adjusted maximum temperature difference was 1.5 ℃. When the adjustment period was 0.5\u20132 h, with the increase in the period, all the indoor temperature decreased gradually, and the temperature variations of users in different locations remained almost the same. The results show that the thermal inertia of the radiator heating system is low, and the thermal response time of its users is less than 0.5 h. Similar to radiant floor heating systems, the average indoor temperature for users increased to 20.1 ℃ when the adjustment period was 8 h, and was the lowest (19.53 ℃) when the adjustment period was 12 h. 4.1.3 Effect of control mode Figs. 20 and 21 show variations in the average indoor temperature of each user under different control modes and heating systems. The following is the temperature calculation method: (4) T mean _ mode _ x i = ∑ T m e a n _ n _ x i 10 T mean . mode _ x i denotes the average indoor temperature of user i with the regulation mode being x, (℃). T m e a n _ n _ x i represents the average indoor temperature of user i with the regulation mode being x and the regulation period being n h, (℃). According to Fig. 20, for each user with a floor radiation system, the impact of the anisochronous and isochronous modes on the indoor temperature was similar. The maximum temperature difference between these two modes was 0.007 ℃. However, users at different locations responded to the regulation mode differently. The average indoor temperature of U201 and U301 was higher under the anisochronous mode. For the remaining users, the indoor temperature was higher under the isochronous mode. The average indoor temperature of the occupants on the top floor was lower than that for the other floors under both the control modes. Similar to radiant floor heating systems, for each radiator user, the difference in average indoor temperature under different control modes was marginal, with a maximum temperature difference of 0.009 ℃ (see Fig. 21,). Unlike radiant floor systems, radiator users in different locations did not show significant temperature differences in either of the regulation modes. In this system, the average indoor temperature of users under the isochronous mode was higher than that under the anisochronous mode. Combining these with the results of period, it can be observed that the user on the top-side of the building with a radiant floor heating system has the lowest temperature among all the users. This situation does not vary with the period or mode of regulation. Therefore, its temperature can be used as a criterion to evaluate the working condition of the radiant floor heating system. When this user's indoor temperature attains the standard, the entire system can be considered to have attained the standard. In contrast, there are no similar rules for radiator systems. The user with the lowest average temperature may be located in different places under different regulation periods and control modes. Moreover, a user's indoor temperature is not related to his/her location in the building. 4.2 System energy consumption Energy consumption is another important evaluation index of building heating systems. In a heating system connected to the district heating with a large heating area and long heating time, marginal differences in building energy consumption can become large when magnified over a large area and long period [40]. 4.2.1 Building energy consumption Building energy consumption accounts for most of the energy consumption in building heating systems. With an identical external envelope structure, the energy consumption of the radiant floor heating system and radiator heating system differed marginally under the baseline conditions. The energy consumption of the radiant floor heating system was marginally higher. In the baseline condition, the average energy consumption of the radiant floor heating system was 32.8 W/m2, and that of the radiator heating system was 32.5 W/m2. Unlike indoor temperature, there is no standard requirement for the energy consumption of individual users in the building. Therefore, energy consumption should be considered from a system perspective. The energy-savings rate of the system under different adjustment cycles and control modes is calculated based on the system heat consumption under the baseline working condition. The energy-savings rate is calculated as follows: (5) η F loor _ n _ x = H C F loor _ n _ x - H C F loor _ b a s e H C F loor _ b a s e × 100 % (6) η R adiator _ n _ x = H C R adiator _ n _ x - H C R adiator _ b a s e H C R adiator _ b a s e × 100 % η F loor _ n _ x and η R adiator _ n _ x represent the energy-savings rates of the radiant floor system and radiator system, respectively, when the adjustment period is n h and the control mode is x, (%). H C F loor _ n _ x and H C R adiator _ n _ x represent the energy consumption of the radiant floor system and radiator system, respectively, when the adjustment period is n h and the regulation mode is x, (W/m2). H C F loor _ b a s e and H C R adiator _ base represent the energy consumption of the radiant floor system and radiator system, respectively, in the baseline condition. Figs. 22 and 23 show the energy efficiency of radiant floor heating systems and radiator heating systems under different regulation cycles and different control modes. According to Fig. 22, the average energy efficiency of the regulated radiant floor heating system was 4.2 %. The lowest energy efficiency was 2.8 % (with 8 h as the adjustment period), and the highest was 6.5 % (with 12 h as the adjustment period). Similar to the indoor temperature distribution in the adjustment process, the shift between isochronous adjustment and anisochronous adjustment did not result in significant variations in energy efficiency. The average and maximum differences in the energy-savings rate caused by the two control modes was 0.01 % and 0.16 %, respectively. When the period of regulation was less than 4 h, the system's energy consumption was stable, and the energy-savings rate was approximately 4.0 %. Fig. 23 shows that the energy efficiency of the adjusted radiator system is higher than that of the radiant floor heating system, with an average energy-savings rate of 6.6 %. The system had the lowest energy efficiency (4.9 %) when the adjustment period was 0.5 h and the highest energy efficiency (9.2 %) when the adjustment period was 12 h. The energy consumption of the radiator system is marginally more sensitive to the control mode than the radiant floor system. The average difference was 0.03 %. Meanwhile, the maximum difference was 0.11 %, which was smaller than that for the radiant floor system. The variation in the overall energy efficiency of the radiator heating system is inversely proportional to the variation in system temperature. These results show that in a building heating system, the average indoor temperature of a user is negatively correlated with the system's energy-savings rate. The indoor temperature variations of an individual user in the building do not represent the temperature variation of the entire building. Therefore, the study considered the average building temperature as the critical factor that affects the building energy-savings rate and then, analyzed the relationship between these. The average temperature of the building is calculated as follows: (7) T Building = ∑ i = 1 10 T i · A i ∑ i = 1 10 A i T Building represents the average temperature of the entire building, (℃); T i represents the average indoor temperature of user i, (℃); and A i represents the indoor space of user i, (m2). Based on the baseline condition, the relationship between the average building temperature and energy efficiency rate of the two studied heating systems is shown in Fig. 24 . It is evident from Fig. 24 that the overall average temperature of the building is negatively correlated with the energy efficiency of the system. The energy efficiency of the building decreases uniformly as the overall average temperature of the building increases. In addition, the trend lines of systems with identical heating patterns are almost identical under different control modes. The fitting trend lines between the overall average building temperature of the two studied heating system and the energy efficiency rates are as follows: (8) Es r R = - 6.745 T Building + 141.79 (9) Es r F = - 8.598 T Building + 179.81 Es r R represents the energy-savings rate of the radiator heating system, (%), and Es r F represents the energy-savings rate of the radiant floor heating system, (%). This result shows that the negative correlation between the overall average temperature of the building and the energy efficiency of the system is constant and does not vary with the regulation method. The energy-savings rate of the radiator system and radiant floor system increased by 6.7 % and 8.6 %, respectively, when the average building temperature decreased by 1 °C. Under an equal temperature reduction, the energy-savings rate of the radiant floor heating system was 1.9 % higher than that of the radiator heating system with an identical external envelope structure. This may have occurred owing to the difference in the amount of heat stored in the two types of heating system building. It is evident from the variation in user's indoor temperature in Figs. 16 and 17 that the building heat storage of the radiant floor heating system is significantly larger than that of the radiator heating system. At an equal temperature reduction, a building with a radiant floor heating system would release a larger amount of building heat storage. This increases the energy savings of the system. 4.2.2 Transmission energy consumption In heating systems, an important parameter apart from building energy consumption is the energy consumption of transmission. The transmission energy consumption is marginal compared with the building energy consumption. However, as a direct conversion of high-grade energy, it is still an essential part of a building heating system. In a building heating system, the transmission energy consumption of the radiant floor heating system is significantly higher than that of the radiator system because its supply water temperature is significantly lower. Under the baseline condition, the transmission energy consumption of the radiant floor heating system was 129.7 MJ, whereas that of the radiator heating system was 10.5 MJ. Fig. 25 shows the transmission energy consumption of radiant floor heating systems and radiator heating systems under different regulation cycles and modes. As shown in Fig. 25, the transmission energy consumption of the radiant floor heating system decreased more significantly after adjustment. Based on the baseline condition, the average energy-savings rate of transmission in the adjusted radiant floor heating system was 23.0 %. The variation in this system\u2019s transmission energy consumption with adjustment periods was in line with the variation in indoor temperature. When the adjustment period was 4.8 h and 8 h, the transmission energy consumption was higher, whereas the others were lower. The variation in transmission energy consumption was marginal when the adjustment period was less than 4 h. The system displayed its lowest transmission energy consumption (90.3 MJ) when the period was 12 h. The decrease in transmission energy consumption was relatively marginal after the radiator heating system was adjusted. Based on the baseline condition, the average energy-savings rate of transmission in this system was 9.8 %. Excluding the adjustment period of 8 h, the transmission energy consumption of the radiator system decreased as the adjustment period increased. The energy consumption of the radiator system attained a minimum of 9.1 MJ when the adjustment period attained 12 h. In the radiant floor heating system and radiator heating system, the transmission energy consumption of the isochronous mode was higher than that of the anisochronous mode. For the radiant floor system and radiator system, the transmission efficiency of the anisochronous mode was 1.42 % and 0.81 %, respectively, higher than that of the isochronous mode. 5 Conclusion In this study, a hydrothermal coupling multi-user building heating system regulation model incorporating two forms of heating (radiant floor heating and radiator heating) was developed. The concept of control mode containing the isochronous mode and anisochronous mode was proposed for the multidimensional regulation process in which the building-level and user-level functioned in conjunction. The effects of the regulation cycle and control mode on the system regulation were studied, and the relevant regulation characteristics of the multi-user building heating system were analyzed. The main conclusions of this study are summarized below: (1) For demand-side regulation, the effect of the adjustment period was significant. The adjustable characteristic of the radiant floor heating system was lower than that of the radiator heating system. In the radiant floor heating system, the user's response time was over 4 h, and the regulation period had a minimal effect on the user's indoor temperature. In the radiator system, the response time of the user did not exceed 0.5 h. Furthermore, the shorter the adjustment period, the smaller was the fluctuation of the indoor temperature. (2) For the radiant floor heating system and radiator heating system, the isochronous control mode and anisochronous mode negligibly affected the indoor temperature and energy consumption of users. The maximum temperature difference between the two modes was 0.007 °C in the radiant floor heating system and 0.009 °C in the radiator heating systems. The maximum energy-savings rate was 0.16 % and 0.11 %, respectively. (3) The temperature distribution of users within a building varies according to the heating system. When all the users have an equal target temperature, the indoor temperature of a radiator heating system user is independent of its location, and it may vary with the adjustment period or mode. In the radiant floor heating systems, the indoor temperature of the top-side floor user was always the lowest among all the users. It did not vary with the adjustment period or control mode. (4) The energy-savings rate of a radiant floor heating system was higher than that of a radiator heating system under an identical external envelope structure. The energy-savings rate of the radiant floor heating system and radiator heating system increased by 8.6 % and 6.7 %, respectively, when the average building temperature reduced by 1 ℃. The energy-savings rate of the radiant floor heating system was 1.9 % higher than that of the radiator heating system when the temperature reductions were at the same level. (5) Compared with the radiator heating system, the transmission energy consumption of the radiant floor heating system decreased more after adjustment. The consumption of the anisochronous mode was lower than that of isochronous mode in both the types of heating systems. After the regulation, the average transmission energy-savings rate of the radiant floor heating system was 23.0 %, and that of the anisochronous mode was 1.42 % higher than that of the isochronous mode. The average transmission energy-savings rate for the radiator heating system was 9.8 %, and that of the anisochronous mode was 0.81 % higher than that of the isochronous mode. The results of this study could provide necessary guidance for demand-side regulation of multi-user heating buildings and provide reference for the selection of control parameters and analysis of control effect. In future work, we would consider the influence of the surrounding environment of the building and the differences in personnel and equipment within the user, and optimize the regulation of multi-user building systems to identify the optimum system control strategy.

        "dc:description": "Multi-user heating buildings based on demand-side adjustment have substantial potential in terms of energy savings and heat efficiency. The former heating system is generally controlled by considering the heating building as a whole. However, the original adjustment method is difficult to apply when there are several independent heat demand users in the building. In this background, this study established a hydrothermal coupled multi-level control model of a multi-user building heating system according to the actual situation of a multi-user heating building. In addition, it investigated the adjustment characteristics between user and building to effectively control the system. The results showed that the adjustment mode has a negligible effect on the room temperature and energy consumption for radiant floor heating systems and radiator heating systems. The control period had a large influence on the adjustment of the multi-user building heating system. The response time of the radiant floor heating system was over 4 h and that of the radiator system was less than 30 min. When the average indoor temperature reduced by 1 ℃, the energy-savings rate of the radiant floor heating system increased by 8.6 %, and that of the radiator heating system increased by 6.7 %. This study provides a basis for formulating and implementing control strategies in multi-user building heating systems.",
