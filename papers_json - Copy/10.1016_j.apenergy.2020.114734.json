This paper proposes an energy-saving oriented air balancing method based on a branch and black-box (B2) model for multi-zone demand controlled ventilation (DCV) systems. The proposed method can achieve accurate air flow control in each zone, which avoids unnecessary energy consumption caused by over-ventilation. The operating procedures of the proposed method are as follows: Building the B2 model for the DCV system\u202f→\u202fPredicting the terminal static pressures under the given zone design flow values\u202f→\u202fDetermining the damper angles of each zone based on the static pressure predictions. In the proposed air balancing method, the basic modelling unit is the duct branch, instead of the internal fittings in the previous model-based air balancing method. Therefore, the proposed method does not need to know the complicated fitting information (e.g., elbows, transitions, dampers, etc.,) in its modelling process and therefore becomes much simpler. In addition, the complexity of the proposed B2 model is also greatly reduced since it is independent with the fitting numbers and does not need to calculate the fitting loss coefficients. Furthermore, the radial basis function (RBF) kernel is also utilized in the proposed method to guarantee the air balancing accuracy. Compared with the existing air balancing methods, the proposed method is more efficient and effective in practice. In the lab, the proposed air balancing method was validated on a real DCV system of 5 zones under various design flow conditions. The experimental results verified the effectiveness of the proposed method on both the air balancing control accuracy and the energy saving ability.

An effective way to improve the building energy performance is to operate the HVAC systems more efficiently and sustainably [7,8]. Studies have shown that a significant increase in the energy efficiency of the HVAC system can be achieved with proper control and optimization strategies [9\u201312]. Demand controlled ventilation (DCV) is a possible strategy to enhance the energy efficiency of the HVAC system by automatically adapting the air flow rate according to the actual ventilation demand [13]. Ahmed et al. [14] investigated the energy saving potential of the DCV system with active chilled beams in a head office building in Finland. The results showed that the DCV system saved 7\u20138% primary energy compared to a constant air volume (CAV) system. Laverge et al. [15] assessed the performance of four DCV strategies for mechanical exhaust ventilation systems in residential buildings. An energy saving potential of 25\u201360% was reported under the applied conditions. Wang et al. [16] evaluated 66 retrofitted packaged rooftop units (RTUs) in various building types and climate conditions, and the filed study demonstrated that the retrofitted RTUs reduced the annual energy use by 57% on average using advanced controls like DCV and fan speed control. To effectively improve the system energy efficiency and indoor thermal comfort, several control strategies have been introduced into the DCV systems considering the occupancy prediction [17\u201319], the overall system performance [20,21] and etc. Sun et al. [19] proposed a CO2-based adaptive DCV strategy for multi-zone ventilation systems, where the occupancy in each individual zone was calculated by a dynamic occupancy detection scheme. The on-site test showed 55.8% reduction in the annual energy consumption compared with the fixed outdoor air flow rate control strategy. Kim et al. [20] developed an integrated meta-model for a daylighting and HVAC system to predict the building energy performance based on the genetic algorithm and artificial neural network. The results showed that an average of 13.7% energy saving was achieved compared with the conventional model. Ge et al. [21] proposed a model-based optimal control strategy, where a cost function was constructed to minimize the overall energy consumption. The proposed control strategy showed about 4.7% and 10.5% energy saving in the tested summer and spring days, respectively. Though the above control strategies can calculate the minimum outside air intake for the DCV system, how to precisely supply the calculated air flow is still a concern in practice. For instance, in a DCV system where the required air flow for each individual zone is known, incorrect damper control may still cause over-ventilation and result in unnecessary energy waste or degradation of thermal comfort [22\u201324]. To solve this problem, Jing et al. [25] first built a physical model for the DCV system to reveal the flow-static pressure relationship in ducts and utilized Bayesian linear regression to train model parameters. Based on the derived physical model, an optimal damper position control method was proposed to realize more accurate air flow control, which solves the over-ventilation problem in multi-zone DCV systems. Experimental results showed that up to 14.3% energy saving could be achieved compared with the conventional DCV control strategy. Sharing the same physical duct system model, many follow-up research on air balancing in multi-zone DCV systems were carried out. In [26], an optimal static pressure set-point selection method was developed. The method calculates the minimum static pressure set-point to alleviate over-ventilation, which reduces the fan power consumption. In [27], a robust air balancing strategy was proposed based on the L1-norm minimization algorithm to further improve the robustness against sensor noise. However, the above air balancing methods [25\u201327] are essentially physical-model-based (physically-based, in short) air balancing methods. These methods require knowing detailed information of the duct system to build/train its physical model. However, due to possible retrofitting and inevitable adjustments during installation, acquiring a precise and thorough duct information either from the building owner or through site investigation is not readily available. In addition, the parameter training for the physical model often involves high computational effort, and the complexity of the physical model increases as the size of the system expands. As a result, the training time may be unacceptably long in practical large-scale duct systems. Therefore, these physically-based air balancing methods still have many limitations in practice. To overcome the limitations of the existing physically-based air balancing methods, this paper proposes a branch and black-box (B2) model-based air balancing method for the DCV system which dispenses with the physical model. Compared with the physically-based methods, the proposed method enjoys the following features: (a) The proposed method requires no knowledge of the detailed duct parameters, which makes possible an accurate air balancing when duct parameters are not accessible in practical use; (b) The proposed method develops a branch-based energy model, whose complexity is irrelevant with the number of duct fittings, which greatly reduces the computational costs of air balancing in large-scale duct systems. (c) The proposed method does not need to calculate the fitting loss coefficients, which offers great convenience and makes it an industry-favorable method to balance the duct system. The reminder of this paper is arranged as follows: Section 2 reviews the energy-saving mechanism for DCV systems. Section 3 introduces the proposed energy-saving oriented B2-model based air balancing method and discusses its advantages. Section 4 presents the experimental platform and demonstrates the experimental validation of the energy-saving performance. Section 5 closes the paper with a summary. 2 Review: Energy-Saving mechanism and challenges for DCV systems 2.1 Energy-saving mechanism for DCV systems (a) Expression for the fan power in DCV systems As shown in Fig. 1 , the power source of the DCV system comes from the fan, which provides the driving force to move the air to each conditioned zone throughout the DCV system. For a given operating point, the fan power consumption can be described by Eq. (1) [28]: (1) P = p fan · q η where P is the fan power, p fan is the fan pressure, q is the air volume flow delivered by the fan and η is the fan efficiency. (b) The relationship between pfan and q in the DCV system Since the fan power is mainly determined by p fan and q, the corresponding expressions and relationship are discussed here. The fan pressure p fan equals the pressure at the system outlet plus the total pressure loss throughout the duct system [29]: (2) p fan = Δ p system + p system outlet where Δp system is the overall pressure loss in the system; p system outlet is the pressure at the system outlet. For DCV systems, the pressure at the system outlet is negligible (i.e., p system outlet\u202f≈\u202f0). Hence, the fan pressure can be simplified as: (3) p fan ≈ Δ p system According to [30], Δp system can be calculated by Eq. (4): (4) Δ p system = fL D h + ∑ C ρ V 2 2 where f is the Darcy friction factor, L is the total length of the duct, Dh is the hydraulic diameter, ∑C is the summation of local loss coefficients, ρ is the density of air and V is the mean flow velocity calculated by the volumetric flow rate q divided by the cross-sectional area A: (5) V = q A Since f, ∑C and V are all related to the air flow q, Eq. (4) can be further expressed as [30]: (6) Δ p system = k q 2 where k is a constant coefficient decided by the characteristics of the actual DCV system. Eq. (6) is also known as the system resistance curve. Based on Eq. (6), an intuitive illustration of the relationship between the fan pressure and air flow in the DCV system is presented in Fig. 2 . As seen, the red line represents the system resistance curve and the blue lines represent the fan curves at different fan speeds, where the intersection points of the two curves are the operation points of the fan at different speeds. As illustrated by Fig. 2, lower air flow (q 1\u202f→\u202fq 2) brings lower fan pressure (pfan 1\u202f→\u202fpfan 2). (c) Reducing the error between the actual flow and demand flow: an effective way to achieve energy-saving By combing Eqs. (1), (3) and (6) and assuming the fan efficiency to be unchanged, the fan power is found to be proportional to the cube of the total air flow: (7) P ∝ q 3 Eq. (7) indicates that low air flow can bring low fan power and good energy saving ability. To illustrate the energy-saving mechanism for the DCV system, Eq. (7) is further modified as: (8) P = γ · q 3 where γ describes the proportionality between P and q 3. If a DCV system suffers over-ventilation problem, the additionally introduced fan power consumption, δP, can be expressed as: (9) δ P = P actual - P demand = P actual P demand - 1 · P demand where Pactual refers to the actually consumed fan power and Pdemand refers to the demanded fan power. Pactual and Pdemand can be expressed as: (10) P actual = γ · q actual 3 (11) P demand = γ · q demand 3 By substituting (10) and (11) to (9), δP can be rewritten as: (12) δ P = q actual q demand 3 - 1 · P demand Here, for convenience of explanation, the relative error ε is introduced, which is defined as the relative difference between the actual flow qactual and the demand flow qdemand : (13) ε = q actual - q demand / q demand where ε\u202f>\u202f0 for over-ventilation DCV systems (qactual \u202f>\u202fqdemand ). Then, Eq. (12) can be derived as: (14) δ P = 1 + ε 3 - 1 · P demand = 3 ε + 3 ε 2 + ε 3 · P demand Eq. (14) demonstrates that δP is positively correlated with ε. Hence, for DCV system that suffers over-ventilation, an effective way to reduce unnecessary energy consumption is to reduce the flow error ε, which is also the motivation of the proposed air balancing method in this paper. 2.2 Challenges for energy-saving in DCV systems According to Section 2.1, an effective way for DCV systems to realize energy saving is to reduce the error between the actual air flow and the demand air flow. In other words, the air balancing techniques, which ensures the DCV system delivers precisely the required air flow to each zone, is a good solution to fix the energy consumption issues caused by over-ventilation. However, as discussed in the Introduction, most of the existing air balancing methods for DCV systems are physically-based air balancing methods which need accurate physical DCV system model and suffer the following challenges in practice: Challenge 1: For a DCV system in Fig. 3 , the physically-based air balancing methods require knowing detailed duct fitting parameters (e.g. the diameter of the pipe D, the radius of the elbow θ, the area ratio of junctions Ab /Ac , and etc.) to build its physical model (see Fig. 4 ). In practice, these parameters need either to be extracted from the manufacture supplied data or to be estimated using proper parameter estimation techniques, which can be inconvenient and inaccurate. Challenge 2: During the physical modelling process of the DCV system, the values of the fitting loss coefficient Cf (see Fig. 4) for each fitting needs to be estimated based on the ASHRAE Duct Fitting Database (DFDB) [30]. However, the DFDB only covers some common fittings and can be different from the actual fittings, which results in inaccurate DCV system model. Challenge 3: To obtain the damper positions satisfying the design air flow requirement, the established physical model needs to be solved either analytically or numerically, which requires high computational effort. Since the complexity of the physical model directly associates with the number of fittings in the DCV system, the computational effort will greatly increase as the size of the system expands, and the training time may be unacceptably long for real DCV systems. The above challenges restrict the practical application of the existing air balancing techniques and make the over-ventilation problem still an intractable problem in practice. Therefore, how to develop an efficient and easy-to-use air balancing method becomes a concern for real DCV systems, which is also the motivation of this paper. In the Section 3, an energy-saving oriented air balancing method which is independent of physical models and requires less computation effort will be presented for the DCV system. 3 Energy-saving oriented air balancing method for DCV systems with branch and black-box (B2) model 3.1 The proposed energy-saving model for the DCV system with branch and black-box (B2) model (a) The definition of \u2018node\u2019, \u2018branch\u2019 and \u2018path\u2019 in the proposed B2 model Unlike the existing physically-based air balancing methods which need to build detailed physical model for every single fitting in the DCV system (See Fig. 4), the proposed air balancing method applies a branch and black-box (B2) model which treats the branch as the basic unit and hence greatly reduces the modelling complexity. As shown in Fig. 5 , by treating the branch as the basic unit, the physical ductwork of the DCV system can be simplified to a simple network with only \u2018node\u2019, \u2018branch\u2019 and \u2018path\u2019 information. The corresponding definitions are given as follows: \u2022 Node: the connection point between two or more branches (See node {1,2,3,4} in Fig. 5); \u2022 Branch: the segment from a node to a terminal (See branch {2,4,6,8,9} in Fig. 5) or between two nodes (See branch {1,3,5,7} in Fig. 5); \u2022 Path: the open trail from the fan to a terminal unit (See path {1,2,3,4,5} in Fig. 5). (b) Procedures of the proposed air balancing method for the DCV system In Fig. 6 , the flowchart of the proposed energy-saving oriented air balancing method is presented, which will be explained step by step in the following parts. 3.1.1 Step 1: Establish the proposed B2 model for the DCV system As shown in Fig. 5, the static pressure (marked by red dot) in the i th path, pi , can be expressed as the summation of the pressure loss of certain branches: (15) p i = β i 1 Δ p branch 1 + β i 2 Δ p branch 2 + ⋯ + β ij Δ p branch j where i denotes the path index and j denotes the branch index; βij takes values 0 or 1, indicating whether branch j exists in (βij \u202f=\u202f1) or not in (βij \u202f=\u202f0) path i; Δp branch is the branch pressure loss. For a certain branch in Eq. (15), its pressure loss Δp branch is the sum of individual losses of all fittings in this branch. Take branch 1 as an example: (16) Δ p branch 1 = Δ p fan 1 + Δ p fitting 1 + Δ p fitting2 + ⋯ + Δ p fitting9 By expanding all Δp branch with the internal fittings, Eq. (15) will become very prolix and complicated, which requires large computational effort. In addition, the calculation relies on the accuracy of the acquired duct fitting parameters and can be inaccurate. Hence, this paper improves the traditional physical model and proposes the B2 model using the feature map and kernel tricks [31]. By analysing the form of the basis function, it can be found that Δp branch is actually decided by the duct flow and fitting parameters. This inspired us to treat the whole branch as a basic unit, where a feature map-based model can be given in a general form: (17) p i = ∑ j = 1 l β ij φ j ( q ) , ∀ i ∈ 0 , . . . , n where n is the number of terminals, which is also the number of paths; l is the number of branches; q is the column vector of terminal flow; βij is the element of the parameter matrix β and pi is the static pressure at the i th terminal, p0 is the fan static pressure. Here, φ(q) is a general feature map function that describes the relationship among the branch pressure loss, duct flow and fitting parameters (i.e., Δp\u202f−\u202fq). It maps the flow vector q to a higher-dimensional feature space H. Based on Eq. (17), for all the n paths in the whole duct system, the corresponding matrix form is given as: (18) p = β φ where φ\u202f=\u202f[φ 1, φ 2, \u2026, φl ]T and p\u202f=\u202f[p0 , p 1, p 2, \u2026, pn ]T. Eq. (18) is the proposed B2 model, which is simple and neat. Obviously, it avoids modelling the individual fittings in the branch. It even does not need to know the detailed fitting parameters due to the later introduced kernel trick. 3.1.2 Step 2: Training the proposed B2 model of the DCV system with kernel trick In practice, m sets of measurements are conducted at each terminal to collect the flow quantities q and static pressure values P. Based on Eq. (18), its objective function can be formulated as follows: (19) J ( φ ) = 1 2 β X - P F 2 where P\u202f=\u202f[p 1, p 2, \u2026, p m ] and X\u202f=\u202f[φ(q 1), φ(q 2), \u2026,φ(q m )]. The objective function is to find a parameter β to make J(φ)\u202f=\u202f0, such that the predictions can coincide with the actual data. In this paper, the kernel trick is applied in model training to avoid explicit mapping into the feature space H. According to the Representer Theorem [31], β can be represented by X: (20) β T = X α which leads to: (21) β X = α T X T X Then the model training target can be naturally switched from finding the optimal \u2018β\u2019 to finding the optimal \u2018α\u2019. Let kernel K denotes the inner product of the mapping function in the feature space H: (22) K q i , q j = φ q i , φ q j where i,j\u202f∈\u202f1,\u2026,m is the index of measurements. Then Eq. (21) can be rewritten with the kernel matrix: (23) β X = α T K where K is the kernel matrix and expressed as: (24) K = K 11 K 12 ⋯ K 1 m K 21 K 22 ⋯ K 2 m ⋮ ⋮ ⋱ ⋮ K m 1 K m 2 ⋯ K mm Here, the element Kij \u202f=\u202fK(q i , q j ) adopts the RBF kernel [32]: (25) K ij = exp - q i - q j 2 2 σ 2 where σ is the bandwidth parameter. To obtain the optimal α, a loss function L(α) is defined here: (26) min α L ( α ) = 1 2 α T K - P F 2 + λ α F 2 where the first term is the error term and the second term is the regularization term, λ is the regularization parameter. By taking the derivative of Eq. (26): (27) ∂ L ( α ) ∂ α = K K T + λ I α - K P T The optimal α can be obtained: (28) α = K K T + λ I - 1 K P T Up to this moment, the training process of the proposed B2 model is finished. 3.1.3 Step 3: Static pressure prediction of the DCV system via the trained B2 model By Eq. (19), the training target is to make J(φ)\u202f=\u202f0, Thus, the static pressure can be derived as: (29) J ( φ ) = 1 2 β X - P F 2 = 0 ⇒ P = β X By substituting Eqs. (23) and (24) to Eq. (29), the static pressure can be further expressed as: (30) P = α T K = α T K 11 K 12 ⋯ K 1 m K 21 K 22 ⋯ K 2 m ⋮ ⋮ ⋱ ⋮ K m 1 K m 2 ⋯ K mm = α T K q 1 , q 1 K q 1 , q 2 ⋯ K q 1 , q m K q 2 , q 1 K q 2 , q 2 ⋯ K q 2 , q m ⋮ ⋮ ⋱ ⋮ K q m , q 1 K q m , q 2 ⋯ K q m , q m Suppose m sets of reference air flow are given as: (31) q ref = q ref 1 q ref 2 ⋯ q ref m Based on Eq. (30), the corresponding m sets of static pressure predictions can be expressed as: (32) P ̂ = P ̂ 1 P ̂ 2 ⋯ P ̂ m = α T K q 1 , q ref 1 K q 1 , q ref 2 ⋯ K q 1 , q ref m K q 2 , q ref 1 K q 2 , q ref 2 ⋯ K q 2 , q ref m ⋮ ⋮ ⋱ ⋮ K q m , q ref 1 K q m , q ref 2 ⋯ K q m , q ref m where P ^ i is the predicted static pressure for the i th reference air flow q ^ ref i : (33) P ̂ i = α T K q 1 , q ref i K q 2 , q ref i ⋯ K q m , q ref i T 3.1.4 Step 4: Damper angle calculation of the DCV system by the predicted static pressure According to the predicted static pressure P ^ and ASHRAE DFDB [30], the fan static pressure can be regulated by fan\u2019s controller [25], the fitting loss coefficient for the corresponding k th terminal damper, Cf ( k ), can be calculated by the following equation: (34) C f ( k ) = 2 P ̂ ( k ) i ρ q ref ( k ) i A ( k ) 2 where P ^ ( k ) i is the predicted static pressure of the k th terminal damper; q ref ( k ) i is the air flow reference for the k th terminal; A ( k ) is the k th damper\u2019s pipe area; ρ is the air density, which is 1.204\u202fkg/m3 at 20\u202f°C and a standard atmospheric pressure. Table 1 is the fitting loss coefficient for the terminal damper. According to Eq. (34) and Table 1, the damper angle can be finally determined. 3.2 Advantages of the proposed energy-saving oriented air balancing method for the DCV system Based on the above description, the proposed energy-saving oriented air balancing method offers the following advantages compared to the existing physically-based air balancing methods: \u2022 The proposed air balancing method requires no knowledge of the detailed duct parameters of the DCV system, which makes possible an accurate air balancing when duct parameters are not accessible in practical use. \u2022 The proposed air balancing method adopts a branch-based energy model, whose complexity is irrelevant with the number of duct fittings, which greatly reduces the computational costs of air balancing in large-scale DCV systems. \u2022 The proposed air balancing method does not need to calculate the fitting loss coefficients, which offers great convenience and makes it an industry-favorable method to balance the DCV system. 4 Experimental validation 4.1 Experimental platform for the test DCV system As shown in Fig. 7 , to validate the proposed air balancing method, a test DCV system of 5 terminals was fabricated in the laboratory. The main duct is DN200 and DN150, and the branch is DN100. The detailed fitting parameters have been listed in Fig. 3. The key device in this platform is the air flow control station (AFCS), which is presented in Fig. 8 . The AFCS is designed for precise control and measurement of terminal flow. It mainly includes an averaging Pitot tube (APT), a differential pressure sensor, a motorized damper (CD9-1 butterfly) and a controller. The damper regulates between 0° (fully open position) and 90° (fully closed position). The differential pressure sensor provides\u202f±3% reading accuracy with the measuring range of\u202f±50\u202fPa. The APT is a dual-plate APT specially designed for the low-flow measurement, and the accuracy of estimation of flow can achieve 0.6% using a revised estimation formula [33]. The imbedded communication module allows a bidirectional data transfer among the individual terminal unit and the host computer. 4.2 Practical considerations to implement the proposed air balancing method in the experiment There are several practical considerations when implementing the proposed air balancing method on the test DCV system: (a) data collection; (b) dataset splitting and (c) tuning of the hyperparameters, which will be introduced in this section. (a) Data collection Prior to collecting the data, the sample dataset was specified first. Given the damper characteristic curve in Fig. 9 , four damper angles (θ\u202f=\u202f[5°, 20°, 40°, 60°]) were selected to capture the characteristics of the damper. This was to cover the linear zone ([20°, 60°]) and the dead zone ([0°, 20°]) of the characteristic curve. In practical applications, the dampers are usually not completely closed to maintain a minimum ventilation rate [34]. Hence, samples beyond 60° were not involved in this experiment. The procedure of data collection is given in Algorithm 1. First, the terminal dampers were regulated to the prescribed damper positions in sequence, and the flow rate and the static pressure were recorded for each terminal. Then the damper angle changed to the next position. In total, the four selected damper angles created 1024 (1024\u202f=\u202f45) sets of combinations for the 5 terminals. Algorithm 1 Full-factorial data collection 1 for angle1\u202f=\u202f[θ1 , θ2 , θ3 , θ4 ] 2 Adjust the 1st damper to angle1; 3 for angle2\u202f=\u202f[θ1 , θ2 , θ3 , θ4 ] 4 Adjust the 2nd damper to angle2; 5 for angle3\u202f=\u202f[θ1 , θ2 , θ3 , θ4 ] 6 Adjust the 3rd damper to angle3; 7 for angle4\u202f=\u202f[θ1 , θ2 , θ3 , θ4 ] 8 Adjust the 4th damper to angle4; 9 for angle5\u202f=\u202f[θ1 , θ2 , θ3 , θ4 ] 10 Adjust the 5th damper to angle5; 11 Record all terminal flow rates and the static pressures; 12 Pause 2\u202fmin 13 end for 14 end for 15 end for 16 end for 17 end for For duct systems with large number of terminals, an alternative algorithm can be considered to reduce the data size. A random data collection algorithm is given in Algorithm 2, which generates an m-by-n matrix of pseudorandom angles drawn from the discrete uniform distribution on the interval [θmin , θmax ]. Due to random sampling between the minimal and maximal damper angles [0°, 60°], the m (m\u202f<\u202f4 n ) sets of data can fully provide enough information for data training. Besides, the number of measurements m is independent with the number of duct system terminals n, which avoids m to become extremely large in large duct systems applications. Algorithm 2 Random data collection 1 Θ\u202f=\u202frandi ([θmin , θmax ], m, n) 2 for i\u202f=\u202f1: m 3 for j\u202f=\u202f1: n 4 anglemj\u202f=\u202fΘmj 5 Adjust the jth damper to anglemj; 6 end for 7 Record all terminal flow rates and the static pressures; 8 Pause 2\u202fmin 9 end for (b) Data splitting For the dataset splitting, the 90\u201310% split (90% training set and 10% test set) was adopted. For the obtained 1024 sets of data, 924 sets were taken for training and parameter selection, and the left 100 sets were used for test. (c) Hyperparameters selection In this paper, the hyperparameter σ and λ were selected by the \u2018so called\u2019 5-fold cross-validation [35,36] from the value set [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 2] and [1\u202f×\u202f10−5, 1\u202f×\u202f10−4, 1\u202f×\u202f10−3, 1\u202f×\u202f10−2, 1\u202f×\u202f10−1, 1] respectively. The procedures of the 5-fold cross-validation is shown in Fig. 10 . To test each set of σ and λ, the dataset was separated into 5 folds. First, Fold 1 was taken as the validation set and the remaining 4 folds were taken as the training set to fit on the model. The prediction error on the validation set was recorded. Then, the validation set was changed to Fold 2. The process repeated 5 times so that each fold was used as the validation set one time and used as the training set four times. The goodness of fit of the model by each set of σ and λ was evaluated by the average prediction error of the 5 runs. The prediction errors under the different σ and λ are plotted in Fig. 11 . According to Fig. 11, the hyperparameter σ was finally set to 0.4 and the hyperparameter λ was set to 1\u202f×\u202f10−4 to get the smallest prediction error. 4.3 Evaluation of the running time of the proposed method In this section, we select a computer whose configuration is \u201cIntel Core i5-8250U @ 1.60\u202fGHz\u201d as the normal computer and utilize \u201cMATLAB R2019b\u201d as the software tool to run the training program of the proposed method. The running time of the proposed method is also compared with the physically-based methods [25,26] (see Table 2 ). 4.4 Verification of the proposed energy-saving model (B2 model) for the test DCV system This section shows the predictive accuracy of the proposed B2 model on the validation dataset. The proposed B2 model was first trained on the training dataset. Then the trained B2 model was used to predict the responses (terminal static pressure) from the observations (terminal flow rate) on the validation dataset. The predictions were then compared with the actual experimental data to evaluate the model accuracy. The proposed B2 model was validated under two data collection algorithms proposed in Section 4.2, i.e., the full-factorial data collection algorithm and random data collection algorithm. In the full-factorial data collection algorithm, m\u202f=\u202f1024. In the random data collection algorithm, m\u202f=\u202f500 since less data are required. The results are presented in Fig. 12 . In Fig. 12, the x-axis denotes the index of the sample, and the y-axis denotes the static pressure values under the corresponding terminal flow rates. The red line represents the actual experimental data. The blue line represents the predictions by the proposed B2 model with the 1024 dataset. The green line represents the predictions by the proposed B2 model with the random dataset. As can be seen, the three lines are basically coincided with each other. The result demonstrates that the proposed B2 model can well predict the static pressure-flow relationship of the DCV system. It also proves that the random data collection algorithm is equally effective with the full-factorial data algorithm method in this case, which indicates that the random data collection algorithm can be used in large duct system applications to reduce the data size. 4.5 Verification of the air balancing ability on the test DCV system The previous section evaluated the accuracy of the proposed B2 model in the predicted static pressure. To assess the actual performance of the proposed air balancing method, 25 sets of different design flow values were tested. In the 25 test cases, the reference flow values were first prespecified. Then, the dampers were regulated based on the predicted static pressure by the fitted model. Finally, the flow of each zone was measured and compared to the design values. The experimental results are presented in Fig. 13 . It has two y-axes: (a) the left y-axis plots the air flow rate, where the cross marker denotes the reference flow and the circle marker denotes the actual obtained flow using the proposed air balancing method; (b) the right y-axis plots the absolute relative error between the measured flow and the reference value. Besides, the industry standards (absolute relative error\u202f<\u202f10% [37,38]) is marked by a grey bar in Fig. 13 for reference. According to Fig. 13, the proposed method showed good air balancing ability under various design flow conditions. For all test cases, the relative error was successfully controlled below the industry standards (10%), which demonstrates that proposed air balancing method is effective to balance the duct flow in DCV systems. Based on the analysis in Section 2.1, it is known that good air balancing performance is the guarantee for energy saving. 4.6 Verification of the energy-saving performance on the test DCV system This section conducted experiments to evaluate the energy-saving performance of the proposed air balancing method. The test scenario is given as follows: the DCV system was originally balanced, where the zone dampers were fixed at θ int \u202f=\u202f[20, 20, 20, 20, 0] (°) and the corresponding zone flow q int exactly satisfied the reference flow values q ref \u202f=\u202f[70, 70, 65, 42, 42] (m3/h). Then, the ventilation demand of Zone 1 increased from 70\u202fm3/h to 150\u202fm3/h. Under this test scenario, both the traditional control method and the proposed method for the DCV system were tested and compared here: (a) Traditional method: In this test experiment, the traditional method is taken from the industrial TAB standards (ASHRAE standard [37] and NEBB standard [38]). It only regulates the dampers at the commissioning phase of the TAB service. During the commissioning phase, all the dampers\u2019 angles are manually determined by engineers via \u2018trial and error\u2019 method to meet the estimated ventilation and indoor air quality (IAQ) requirement. After the commissioning phase, the dampers\u2019 angles remain unchanged in the subsequent system operation stage. During system operation, since all the dampers\u2019 angles are fixed, the building owner can only change the fan\u2019s speed to roughly regulate the ventilation of the duct system to response the ventilation load change. (b) Proposed method: Compared to the traditional method, the proposed air balancing method applies data-driven method to control the dampers\u2019 angles via computer in real time. With the proposed method, all the dampers\u2019 angles can be automatically regulated at any time (including the commissioning phase and system operation phase) to accommodate the changing demand. The experiment was operated by the following steps: Step 1: This stage mimics the commissioning stage of TAB, where the initial air flow reference for the five zones are q ref \u202f=\u202f[70, 70, 65, 42, 42] (m3/h). Both the traditional method and the proposed method can regulate the dampers\u2019 angles at this step to meet the air flow reference. As a result, the initial dampers\u2019 angles for the five zones are set as θ int \u202f=\u202f[20, 20, 20, 20, 0] (°). Step 2: This stage mimics the system operation stage in the real building. In this mimic scenario, the ventilation load in Zone 1 is gradually increased from 70\u202fm3/h to [90, 95, 100, 105, 110, 115, 120, 125, 130, 135, 140, 145, 150] (m3/h), while all the other zones are kept at constant ventilation loads. Step 3: In this stage, the traditional method and the proposed method are applied respectively to increase Zone 1\u2019s actual flow from 70\u202fm3/h to 150\u202fm3/h to meet the increasing ventilation demand. At the same time, the ventilation in the other zones and the total fan power are recorded for later energy performance evaluation. Fig. 14 compares the measured ventilation in the remaining 4 zones when regulating Zone 1 with traditional method and the proposed method. As is clearly shown, the traditional method is apparently higher than the reference flow, whereas the proposed method is almost the same as the reference. In the traditional method, when the fan speed increases to accommodate the ventilation change, the other zones will suffer over-ventilation. According to the analysis in Section 2.1, the over-ventilation will bring unnecessary energy consumption. In comparison, the proposed method regulates all zone dampers in real time. The proposed air balancing method reallocates the flow of the whole DCV system to ensure that all zones can satisfy the demand under the new working point, which effectively avoids the over-ventilation. To better illustrate the energy-saving performance of the proposed air balancing method, the reduction in ventilation is plotted in Fig. 15 . As seen, the reduction in zone ventilation increases as the load increases. Therefore, the proposed air balancing method enjoys good energy-saving performance compared to the traditional method. Fig. 16 shows the total power of the ventilation system with the traditional method and the proposed air balancing method, respectively. As can be seen, the total power consumption by the proposed method is significantly lower than the traditional method. By using the proposed method, the energy consumption can be greatly reduced. In Fig. 17 , the energy saving ability of the proposed air balancing method is further presented. According to Fig. 17, the energy saving demonstrates an upward trend as the ventilation load increases, and it reaches around 60% when the ventilation load is 150\u202fm3/h. Table 3 shows all the recorded experiment data for Figs. 16 and 17. Based on the above experiment results, it can be concluded that the proposed air balancing method is indeed an energy-efficient way to achieve the design flow requirement with minimal energy consumption for the DCV system. 5 Conclusions and future work In this paper, an energy-saving oriented air balancing method based on a branch and black-box (B2) model is proposed to precisely deliver the required air flow to each zone in the demand controlled ventilation (DCV) system. As a result, the energy waste problem caused by over-ventilation is effectively solved by the proposed method. In addition, the RBF kernel is utilized in the proposed method to reduce the dependence of the air balancing model on the physical duct information, which greatly simplifies the modelling complexity and improves the air balancing accuracy. Compared with the existing air balancing methods, the proposed B2 model-based air balancing method enjoys the following advantages: (a) It does not need to know the detailed fitting parameters of the physical duct system; (b) The complexity of the proposed B2 model does not increase with the number of duct fittings; (c) The calculation of the fitting loss coefficients is no longer required. A real DCV system is fabricated in the lab to test the performance of the proposed air balancing method. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method can effectively avoid over-ventilation and improves the system energy performance. The proposed method provides an effective way to achieve accurate air supply, which is also applicable for VAV systems. In practice, one limitation of the proposed method is that each terminal requires both flow sensor and static pressure sensor, which may increase the operating cost. The future works will focus on further reducing such cost of the proposed method.

        "dc:description": "This paper proposes an energy-saving oriented air balancing method based on a branch and black-box (B2) model for multi-zone demand controlled ventilation (DCV) systems. The proposed method can achieve accurate air flow control in each zone, which avoids unnecessary energy consumption caused by over-ventilation. The operating procedures of the proposed method are as follows: Building the B2 model for the DCV system\u202f→\u202fPredicting the terminal static pressures under the given zone design flow values\u202f→\u202fDetermining the damper angles of each zone based on the static pressure predictions. In the proposed air balancing method, the basic modelling unit is the duct branch, instead of the internal fittings in the previous model-based air balancing method. Therefore, the proposed method does not need to know the complicated fitting information (e.g., elbows, transitions, dampers, etc.,) in its modelling process and therefore becomes much simpler. In addition, the complexity of the proposed B2 model is also greatly reduced since it is independent with the fitting numbers and does not need to calculate the fitting loss coefficients. Furthermore, the radial basis function (RBF) kernel is also utilized in the proposed method to guarantee the air balancing accuracy. Compared with the existing air balancing methods, the proposed method is more efficient and effective in practice. In the lab, the proposed air balancing method was validated on a real DCV system of 5 zones under various design flow conditions. The experimental results verified the effectiveness of the proposed method on both the air balancing control accuracy and the energy saving ability.",
