Recent research has looked into the potential for energy savings from adopting setpoint temperatures based on adaptive comfort. The recently suggested Adaptive-Comfort-Control-Implementation Script (ACCIS), a computational method that expands the use of air conditioning to adaptive comfort, can be used to accomplish this. The user's setup and an Input Data File (IDF) are used by ACCIS to convert PMV-based EnergyPlus models into adaptive setpoint models. The Adaptive Comfort Control Implemented Model (\u201caccim\u201d) Python module has been used to nest ACCIS, which was originally an Energy Management System (EMS) script. This research focuses on the creation of ACCIS and offers a more in-depth understanding of how the computational method functions based on the connections between the objects that compose it. Since all weather file quantity constraints have been overcome and studies can now be generated based on millions of simulations, ACCIS opens up new opportunities for performing energy simulations on a worldwide scale rather than only on a national or continental level. This potential is increased considering that, until recently only international models ASHRAE Standard 55 and European standard EN16798-1 were considered in ACCIS, but now a recent update allows to select local comfort models developed for specific areas. As a result, this potential is firstly demonstrated by means of the study of the 3 arguments that have the most important impact on the setpoint temperatures: the thermal comfort model, the acceptability levels and the behaviour of setpoint temperatures when adaptive comfort models are not applicable; and secondly by means of an actual example of use of accim.

As a result of human behaviour that disregards the environment, climate change\u2019s severity increases every year [1]. Using the preindustrial mean surface temperature as a baseline, temperature rises might range from 2.5 °C in 2050 to 4.5 °C in 2100, 7.5 °C in 2200, and 8 °C in 2300 [2]. To prevent resource depletion and pollutant gas emissions, the building sector in Europe is required to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 90% by 2050 [3]. In light of climate change, it is essential to remember that the primary function of buildings is to provide protection from the outdoor environment. Air conditioning systems are occasionally used to maintain a comfortable interior temperature. But utilising these systems, which frequently have extremely constrained setpoint temperatures that are fairly comfortable for the human body, may lessen people's physiological, psychological, and behavioural ability to adapt to changes in ambient temperature [4], in addition to requiring high energy rates. Recent studies have concentrated on finding ways to mitigate this issue by utilising adaptive comfort settings for air conditioning, or, in other words, adopting adaptive setpoint temperatures (AST). According to the standards ASHRAE 55 and EN16798-1, adaptive comfort models are only appropriate for naturally ventilated spaces. Recent studies, however, have shown that regardless of the technology used to create the interior environment, humans seem to be able to adapt to a considerably wider range of indoor temperatures [5]. It is also conceivable to create statistically significant adaptive comfort models for cooling operations in air-conditioned office buildings, according to scientific data [6]. The values of these AST, which were determined using adaptive thermal comfort techniques, correspond to upper and lower comfort thresholds. It is therefore expected that energy consumption will be reduced due to the use of less-restricted setpoint temperatures while maintaining adequate thermal human sensation because the use of AST shows that the operating temperature fluctuates within the adaptive thermal comfort zone: (i) R.P. Kramer et al. [7] investigated energy conservation at an Amsterdam museum by using a variety of setpoint temperatures and adaptive thermal comfort levels. A 74% energy savings was achieved by allocating the lower comfort limit to the heating setpoint temperature and only using the Heating, Ventilation and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) systems when the museum was open; (ii) Sánchez-Guevara Sánchez et al. used monthly setpoint temperatures in three Spanish residential buildings based on the comfort limitations of the adaptive model from ASHRAE Standard 55-2013 [8]. Energy consumption was reduced by 20% and 80%, respectively, in heating and cooling [9]. Adaptive comfort models have been used up till now to suggest the integration of consumers' climatic adaptability into the low energy consumption. Standards like EN 16798-1:2019 [10] and ASHRAE 55-2020 [11], which take into account that users can interact with the environment, incorporate such models. The Smart Control and Thermal Comfort SCATs (conducted in Europe) and RP-884 international initiatives served as the foundation for both standards (carried out in various world locations). The outcomes of these experiments demonstrated the connection between the operative temperature and the outdoor temperature in terms of user comfort. Field studies revealed that occupants' temperature reactions vary from those of occupants in buildings with centralised HVAC systems primarily because of variances in the thermal experience, the availability of controls, and changes in occupant expectations [12]. In recent years, distinct adaptive thermal comfort models have been created to (i) escape the restrictions of the global models, (ii) comprehend the uniqueness of each country, and (iii) to address individual living or building usage conditions: The comfort standard is based on a limited amount of data collecting for outdoor temperatures more than 25 °C, according to the EN 16798-1:2019 standard. This is due to the fact that, among all the case studies of the countries participating in the development of the standard, just two buildings in Greece have data under such circumstances, and the majority of the sample is composed of colder-climate countries (e.g., United Kingdom and France). In other words, applying this model for warm climates limits the results and reduces the model's applicability, especially when taking into account the studies on the effects of climate change [13,14]. Even though the cases studies database takes into account examples from all across the world, many of the ASHRAE 55-2020 cases include mixed-mode and centralised HVAC facilities. Because of this, particular instances may differ for the various criteria taken into consideration. Recently, a number of national standards have been created, such as GB/T50785 [15] from China and ISSO 74 [16,17] from the Netherlands. For the Chinese standard, two distinct models are established based on the cold, warm, and moderate climatic zones. Additionally, each model creates two distinct groups, and the limitations deviate from international norms. Additionally, China built particular models for particular locations [18]. In case of the Dutch standard, the second revision from 2014 [19] focuses on creating interior settings that fall into one of four categories of acceptability utilising both international databases and local research with various upper and lower bounds. Carrying out detailed research for various building uses or to comprehend actual living conditions is not new, however it has become a global trend since many adaptive comfort field studies have arised in the last years. For instance, these studies have been carried out for countries such as Pakistan [20], Iran [21], China [22\u201325], Tunisia [26], Japan [27\u201329], India [30\u201332], Australia [33,34], Qatar [35], Brazil [36], Colombia [37], Mexico [38,39], Chile [40] and Romania [41], building uses such as hospitals [42], shelters [43], dormitories [44], prefab construction site offices [45] or workshops [46], or social categories as age and gender, e.g. children in primary school [47], females [48] and older residents [49]. DesignBuilder [50], which makes use of the simulation engine EnergyPlus [51], was largely used to create exploratory investigations using building energy simulations (BES). Previously, adaptive setpoint temperatures were applied to BES using 2 methods: first, very simplistic ones like changing setpoint temperatures monthly and then adding the outcomes of the 12 simulations; second, more sophisticated ones like using Schedule:Compact objects, EnergyPlus objects that can precisely define setpoint temperatures and operation schedules. However, it included a laborious, challenging, and time-consuming manual approach that was prone to mistakes which took the following steps: (i) setpoint temperatures were previously calculated using an Excel spreadsheet and then (ii) pasted into Schedule:Compact objects which should be created in advance, then (iii) the appropriate EPW file was selected, and lastly (iv) the simulation of the setpoint temperature and climate zone took place. Additional file management tasks were also required. However, this process needed to be repeated for each combination of AST and EPW, which could be numbered over hundreds or thousands. To address this flaw, a computational method called Adaptive-Comfort-Control-Implemented Model (ACCIS) was developed [52]. It was created as part of the conceptual framework called Adaptive-Comfort-Control-Implemented Model (ACCIM), which aimed to change the paradigm, from using fixed PMV-based to adaptive setpoint temperatures. Additionally, earlier versions of ACCIS were used, enabling studies based on numerous simulations in different locations and AST, such as 780 [53] or 48,786 [54] unique location-AST combinations. The only accessible software or procedure at this time is the one described in this article. Other methods provide comparable results, but they require physical labour, which is time-consuming, exhausting, and prone to mistake. Some of the key research articles for this computational approach are compiled in Table 1 . The advantages of accim compared to previous methods for applying adaptive setpoint temperatures are: \u2013 The high customization potential: the multiple arguments allow the user to transform static setpoints into adaptive based on 11 parameters; \u2013 The implementation of setpoints \u201con the go\u201d: with previous methods, the daily setpoints needed to be calculated in advance; however, accim allows to implement the adaptive setpoints as the simulation runs, since the EnergyManagementSystem objects computes them in each simulation timestep. Until recently, only international models (namely ASHRAE 55 and EN16798-1) and the Spanish Building Code could be selected in ACCIS. However, ACCIS has recently been updated, and in accim 0.6.2, multiple local comfort models developed for specific areas can be used, which has been collected in Table 2 . In this table, the ComfStand Name has been coded following the pattern \u201cCS_Country Code Model name or author other specifications\u201d, where CS stands for ComfStand, the argument used to select the comfort standard. This pattern has been kept for consistency with the naming code for the output IDF files generated by accim. The EnergyManagementSystem (EMS) script ACCIS and the Python module accim have already been investigated in another study [52]. However, that research only offered a broad description for each, not an explanation of the specifics. This research offers a thorough understanding of ACCIS by considering the usage of various items in the EnergyPlus and EnergyManagementSystem environments, as well as the functioning and interactions of various variables. The novelty also resides in the local comfort models that now can be used to generate building energy models with setpoint temperatures. The aforementioned points are covered in Section 2, along with a brief overview of the software that ACCIS depends on, a brief description of the many objects used in the EnergyManagementSystem environment, an explanation of ACCIS's limits, and a clarification of how ACCIS functions, split down into 4 stages. The results are presented in Section 3, in which the main three arguments are studied, and a demonstration of capabilities is provided. The debate is presented in Section 4, and the conclusions in Section 5. 2 Methodology 2.1 Methods: EnergyPlus and EnergyManagementSystem The US Department of Energy created EnergyPlus, the ACCIS simulation engine, as an open-source BES application. It is used by engineers, architects, and researchers to model how buildings consume energy and water. This software runs on a console and processes input data from the user before writing it to text files. It was first developed in FORTRAN, but as of version 8.2.0, it has been converted to C++. Due of the complexity of this software and its programming language, graphical user interfaces like DesignBuilder or OpenStudio [33] have been developed to assist non-programmers. EnergyPlus is a powerful programme, but with limited modification possibilities. However, there is a built-in element called EnergyManagementSystem (EMS) that makes up for this shortcoming. This is a powerful tool for developing custom modelling and control procedures as well as for giving supervisory control over particular EnergyPlus modelling domains. However, because it requires the development of computer programmes in the EnergyPlus Runtime Language (ERL), which is required to describe the control algorithms, it is challenging to use. 2.2 EnergyManagementSystem objects It is necessary to explain some EnergyManagementSystem items in order to properly comprehend how ACCIS functions: EnergyManagementSystem:Sensor (hereinafter, sensors) objects are used to gather information from model components that could vary over the course of a single run period for use in control calculations. EnergyManagementSystem:Actuator (hereinafter, actuators) objects are used to actuate some EnergyPlus functionalities. They typically replace existing functionalities rather than introducing a new set of EMS-aware controls and component models. EnergyManagementSystem:Program objects hold the overridden behavior that is applied to the simulation run using a variety of statements, including set-statements to assign variables, if-blocks to alter behavior based on conditions, or while-blocks to iterate as long as a condition is satisfied. The time for when the ERL programs are executed, at some particular EMS Calling Points, is described using EnergyManagementSystem:ProgramCallingManager (hence, program calling manager) objects. These objects are used to describe the timing for when the ERL programs are run. In order to declare variables with a user-defined name and a global scope, EnergyManagementSystem:GlobalVariable (hereafter, global variable) objects must be used. EnergyManagementSystem:OutputVariable (hereafter, output variable) objects are used to create a custom output variable that is mapped to an EMS variable. The normal EnergyPlus output mechanisms, like the Output:Variable object, can then be used to report the custom output variable to the output file. 2.3 Limitations This section presents the limitations for accim 0.6.2. The building for which the script has been written only contains one zone (designated Block1:Zone1) and one window (designated Block1_Zone1_Wall_Win) in order to simplify the script. The EMS sensors, actuators, program calling managers, programs, output variables, and global variables connected to each particular zone or window must therefore be added for all buildings with numerous zones and/or windows. The name of the room or window appears in the names of each of these things. Additionally, the HVAC system interior units need to be watched over in order to use mixed mode. To do this, a VRF system must be individually designed for each zone, with the Outdoor units bearing names in the format \u201cVRF Outdoor Unit_BlockX_ZoneY\u201d. In addition to the aforementioned, ACCIS needs the following elements to function properly: \u2013 For EnergyPlus to calculate the prevailing mean outdoor temperature (PMOT) and running mean outdoor temperature (RMOT), People objects must have the values \u201cAdaptiveASH55\u2033 and \u201dAdaptiveCEN15251\u2033 in the \u201cThermal Comfort Model 1 Type and 2 Type\u201d fields. \u2013 \u201cThermostatSetpoint:DualSetpoint\u201d objects must be used to assign Schedule:Compact objects with the name pattern \u201cFORSCRIPT_AHST_BLOCKX_ZONEY\u201d to the associated \u201cBLOCKX_ZONEY\u201d in the IDF file. \u2013 All zones must have access to natural ventilation, windows must constantly be open, and the ventilation technique must be \u201cCalculated\u201d for mixed-mode to function. If the weather is not favourable, ACCIS will close the windows. \u2013 It is recommended to name the zones as short as possible, because the lines of any EMS program cannot exceed 100 characters. \u2013 The language of the Graphical User Interface (GUI) must be English. These prerequisites must be satisfied in order to apply setpoint temperatures using either copying and pasting ACCIS in the IDF or in the DesignBuilder Scripting module. Therefore, using the Python package accim is advised since the limitations above except the language of the GUI are not applicable in that case. It automatically verifies that the IDF file complies with the limits indicated earlier and, if not, automatically modifies the IDF to ensure that the operation is correct. The open-source code of accim is available at the web repository [59], and a user manual is available in the documentation [60]. 2.4 ACCIS operation The ACCIS EMS code, added to the IDF file when accim 0.6.2 is used, is included in Appendix A.1 of this document. There are four main stages in ACCIS: (i) Stage 1, where some user-defined data is stored at some global variables, and sensors, actuators, and global variables are added; (ii) Stage 2, where some programs are run to apply the user-defined input data to set up the customized outputs; (iii) Stage 3, where data to be reported is computed and actuators override the values of the components; and (iv) Stage 4, where the output variables are added to show which variables need to be reported. The operation is described in detail below, and it is advised to read the script in Appendix A.1, in which line numbers referred to the code are indicated, and flowcharts (Figs. 1 and 2 ) as this section is read. The highlighted syntax has been maintained, while comments and clarifications in the code are shown by a \u201c!\u201d symbol in grey. 2.4.1 Stage 1 (i) First, the SetInputData Program object and the ProgramCallingManager are added (lines 5 to 33). As implied by the name, its purpose is to store the input data using set-statements so that the simulation run can be customized later. ComfStand, CAT, ComfMod, HVACmode, VentCtrl, VSToffset, MinOToffset, MaxWindSpeed, ACSTtol, and AHSTtol are the global variables where the input data is saved. The documentation page [19] provides a detailed explanation of these many characteristics. Some input data variables, which are used later in conditional statements, regard the input values as categorical data. These variables are: - ComfStand is used to control the comfort standard. It can range from 0 to 21, based on Table 2; - CAT is used to control the occupant expectations. It depends on the ComfStand chosen, but 1, 2, or 3 can be stored for those developed similarly to EN16798-1, otherwise 80 or 90 can be stored for those developed similarly to ASHRAE 55; - ComfMod is used to control if limits are PMV-based (in that case, 0 is stored), or adaptive (in which 1, 2 or 3 can be stored, which controls the static behaviour of the setpoints when the adaptive model is not applicable). - HVACmode is used to control the operating mode of the building. Natural ventilation is not allowed and the full air-conditioning setting is activated if 0 is stored; free-running mode is applied, and natural ventilation is allowed if 1 is stored; mixed-mode is applied if 2 is stored, therefore natural ventilation is prioritised, otherwise windows are closed and HVAC system starts to work. - VentCtrl is used to control the ventilation mode. The ventilation setpoint temperature is set to the comfort temperature if 0 is stored. If 1, the top comfort limit is assigned. Ventilation behaviours for values 2 and 3 are are similar respectively to 0 and 1, however in this case doors and windows are opened based on the customised venting opening factor. The remaining variables in the supplied data are all regarded as numbers. Since adding this script to the IDF file was the only way to utilize it prior to the creation of accim, the user had to modify these settings to customize the simulation. Similar to SetInputData, the SetVOFinputData Program and ProgramCallingManager objects are added (lines 35 to 49), although in this case, the global variables where input data is saved are MaxTempDiffVOF, MinTempDiffVOF, and MultiplierVOF. These arguments are used to modulate the gradual opening of the windows and doors depending on the outdoor temperature. When MaxTempDiffVOF (the maximum temperature difference for ventilation), windows and doors remain open the fractional value entered in MultiplierVOF. On the other hand, when the temperature difference is smaller than MinTempDiffVOF (the minimum temperature difference for ventilation) but not a negative value, windows and doors are fully opened. Therefore, these programs were initially placed at the beginning of the script to distinguish them from the non-editable code. (ii) To declare all of the many variables utilized by ACCIS, a global variable object is created (line 54 to 124). While some of these connect to a certain zone, others do not. The Appendix A.1 contains further information for each global variable. (iii) Then, a number of sensors are attached (lines 129 to 199), which will be utilized to gather data from certain components (Table 3 ). In light of this, these will make it possible to determine the values for the RMOT, PMOT, and for each thermal zone and window, the zone operational temperature, the cooling rate, the heating rate, the outdoor air wind speed, and the outdoor air dry-bulb temperature at each timestep. In the case of the zones, these last five components are related to the zones themselves or the VRF indoor units situated in those zones, and in the case of the windows, these final five components refer to the zones where the windows are placed or the VRF indoor units of those zones. According to the EnergyPlus Input Output Reference, the RMOT is the weighted mean outdoor temperature of the previous 7 days, while in case of the PMOT, the number of days prior to the day in question is 30. (vi) Afterwards, some actuators are also introduced (lines 203 to 226, Table 4 ). With these, it will be possible to change the open or closed state of the current window (with Block1_Zone1_Win_VentOpenFact) as well as the values of the schedules allocated to the heating and cooling setpoint temperatures for the existing zone (ACST_Act_Block1_Zone1 and AHST_Act_Block1_Zone1, respectively). 2.4.2 Stage 2 The following objects are the programs, which will ascertain the link between the previously added sensors and actuators and define the various global variables stated, once the global variables, sensors, and actuators have been added. The program calling managers, who will choose when to call the programs, are also included. The programs that are used to set the adaptive setpoint temperatures are incorporated first. Based on the input data supplied at the SetInputData program, these will calculate and save the relevant values to various global variables. The SetComfTemp program (lines 230 to 295) is used to store at the global variable ComfTemp the comfort temperature at each timestep. Depending on the value given to ComfStand in the SetInputData program, the comfort temperature for the selected comfort model or standard will be stored. All the comfort models or standards are gathered in Table 2, as well as their associated ComfStand value. Mostly, the PMOT sensor is utilized to determine the comfort temperature, however there are some cases in which the RMOT sensor is used (i.e., when EN16798-1 is used, or when the regression equation has been developed for 30-days-long weighted mean outdoor temperatures). The SetAppLimits program (lines 297 to 435) is used to store the values of the applicability limitations in the global variables created for that purpose (AHSTaul, AHSTall, ACSTaul and ACSTall). The applicability thresholds will be established for the associated comfort model based on the value supplied to ComfStand as well. The applicability limitations are set to 50 if the recorded value does not fall under any of the categories mentioned above (which means the model will not be applicable). The ApplyCAT program (lines 437 to 598) is used to record the values of the offset for the heating and cooling setpoint temperatures from comfort temperature in the global variables created specifically for this purpose (AHSToffset and ACSToffset). These also rely on the settings that were previously saved in CAT and ComfStand. The setpoint temperatures for the global variables AHST and ACST are calculated and stored using the SetAST program (lines 600 to 2743). ComfStand and ComfMod values that were previously stored, together with those of other sensors and global variables, are used to select the desired setpoint temperature. This program is the longest and one of the most significant since it has 101 if-blocks to pass through all ComfStand, CAT and ComfMod values, and uses the set-statement patterns to compute and save the values for the setpoints (Equations (1) and (2)). (1) s e t A C S T = R M O T ∗ m + n + A C S T o f f s e t + A C S T t o l (2) s e t A H S T = R M O T ∗ m + n + A H S T o f f s e t + A H S T t o l In both equations, the directive \u201cset\u201d instructs ERL to save the value; the global variables for the adaptive cooling and heating setpoint temperatures are ACST and AHST, respectively; \u201cRMOT\u201d is the sensor for the running mean outdoor temperature, which can also alternatively be \u201cPMOT\u201d; \u201cm\u201d and \u201cn\u201d are coefficients of the comfort model regression equation (for example, 0.33 + 18.8 in case of EN 16798\u20131 adaptive model); \u201cACSToffset\u201d and \u201cAHSToffset\u201d are global variables for the offset from comfort temperature previously stored in ApplyCAT; and \u201cACSTtol\u201d and \u201cAHSTtol\u201d are global variables added to allow for certain tolerances, stored in SetInputData. These tolerances, whose typical values might be ±0.1 °C, are intended to be utilized to guarantee that temperature in all timesteps is within the comfort zone because the simulated operating temperature can occasionally be a few decimals of degrees higher than the setpoint temperatures. The setpoint temperatures without tolerances (AHSTnoTol and ACSTnoTol), which are the same value as the adaptive comfort limits, are computed and stored using the SetASTnoTol program (lines 2745 to 2753). AHSTnoTol must store a positive value, whereas ACSTnoTol must store a negative value. To apply the mixed-mode and the ventilation setpoint temperature at global variables MinOutTemp and VST, the SetVST program (lines 2755 to 2795) is used to compute and save the minimum outside temperature. When the adaptive model is applicable, the value for MinOutTemp is determined by subtracting the global variable MinOToffset (stored at SetInputData program) from the AHST, while the value for VST is determined by adding the global variable VSToffset (also stored at SetInputData program); otherwise, it is stored as the average of the two setpoint temperatures. Finally, the program SetMyVOF is added. Since it is used to gradually modulate the fractional opening of windows and doors as a function of the difference between outdoor and indoor temperatures, firstly computes the slope of the function based on the global variables MultiplierVOF, MinTempDiffVOF and MaxTempDiffVOF. After calculating the actual temperature difference, it is input in an if-block to decide to what extent windows and doors should be opened, and this fractional value is stored in the global variable Block1_Zone1_Win_MyVOF. 2.4.3 Stage 3 At this point, the setpoint temperatures have already been determined using all programs. Therefore, to execute computations or modify the setpoint temperatures schedule object and the window\u2019s open or closed state, all of the following programs are utilized. When the related zone\u2019s operative temperature (i) is within thermal comfort limits, when it is not due to (ii) heat or (iii) cold but is still applicable, and when it is not applicable due to (vi) heat or (v) cold, the CountHours_Block1_Zone1 program (lines 2826 to 2905) computes these times and stores them in the global variables (i) ComfHours_Block1_Zone1, (ii) DiscomfAppHotHours_Block1_Zone1, (iii) DiscomfAppColdHours_Block1_Zone1, (vi) DiscomfNonAppHotHours_Block1_Zone1, and (v) DiscomfNonAppColdHours_Block1_Zone1, added for that reason. All other variables at this time are either sensors or previously saved global variables. Similar to the previous programme, CountHoursNoApp_Block1_Zone1 (lines 2907 to 2922) only checks to see if the operating temperature is within comfort limits (stored at the global variables ACSTnoTol and AHSTnoTol), and if it is, it stores the time at the global variable ComfHoursNoApp_Block1_Zone1. Otherwise, it ignores the applicability limits. Five if-blocks with many nested if-blocks make up ApplyAST_Block1_Zone1 (lines 2924 to 3033). The first and second if-blocks are used to gather conditions into a single variable, respectively related to the non-usage of heating and cooling systems and some environmental conditions, since nested if-blocks are allowed only up to 5 levels in EMS. The third determines if the environment is suitable for mixed-mode ventilation, and if it is, 1 is saved as a boolean at the local variable Ventilates_HVACmode2_Block1_Zone1 for usage at the fifth if-block. The fourth if-block, which is dependent on the global variable VentCtrl saved at SetInputData, is also used to determine if the surrounding circumstances are suitable for ventilation, but in this case in free-running mode. If the circumstances are suitable, 1 is saved as a boolean in a new local variable called Ventilates_HVACmode1_Block1_Zone1. The fifth if-block modifies the values of the Schedule:Compact objects ACST_Sch_Block1_Zone1 and AHST_Sch_Block1_Zone1 based on the value of the global variable HVACmode, stored at SetInputData. The actuators ACST_Act_Block1_Zone1 and AHST_Act_Block1_Zone1 are given the values of ACST and AHST, respectively, if HVACmode is 0; 100 and −100, respectively, are assigned to the cooling and heating setpoint actuators if HVACmode is 1; and if HVACmode is 2, and the previously evaluated environmental conditions are not acceptable, ACST and AHST are also given to the cooling and heating actuators. Additionally, the global variable VentHours_Block1_Zone1 stores the period of time during which ventilation is permitted. Since the scope of the local variable VentHours_Block1_Zone1 is exclusive to this application, it has not been defined. All sensors are connected to thermal zones since this software operates at the zone level (all sensors include the zone name as a prefix or suffix). The structure and goals of SetWindowOperation_Block1_Zone1_Win (lines 3035 to 3145) are very similar to those of the preceding programme ApplyAST_Block1_Zone1, with the exception that the overridden component is the state of the windows, which is determined by the actuator Block1_Zone1_Win_VentOpenFact (1 is open, 0 is closed). Since the software in this instance operates at the window level, all sensors are connected to the window and use the window name as a prefix or suffix. 2.4.4 Stage 4 The output variables for the stated global variables are then included (lines 3149 to 3330). These objects are used to give EnergyPlus data on the global variables linked to EMS that must be given at the simulation results. The complete list of output variable objects is shown in Table 5 with the global variable\u2019s name in the field labelled \u201cEMS Variable Name\u201d and the name and reporting units in the fields labelled \u201cName\u201d and \u201cUnits\u201d. The distinction between \u201cOutput:Variable\u201d and \u201cEnergyManagementSystem:OutputVariables\u201d objects must be made. The usage of \u201cOutput:Variable\u201d objects extends beyond EMS, and they specify the variables that must be reported. 3 Results 3.1 Customization potential of the main arguments ACCIS has a great potential for the development of parametric studies based on adaptive thermal comfort: firstly, it allows the simulation at any location, since adaptive setpoint temperatures are calculated \u2018on the go\u2019; secondly, the wide range of arguments it admits provide an extensive scope of different settings, customised by the user. The latter is demonstrated in this section, considering the version of accim is 0.6.2, by means of the study of the main 3 parameters that have an influence on the adaptive setpoint temperatures: ComfStand, CAT and ComfMod. 3.1.1 ComfStand: Thermal comfort models involved Firstly, the argument ComfStand allows to define the thermal comfort model or standard to work with. Available models are those shown in Table 2. In order to show the fitting of the operative temperature to the heating and cooling setpoint temperatures, a number of building performance simulations has been carried out, which are shown in Figs. 3 and 4 . These figures show all models and standards from Table 2. Specifically, Fig. 3 shows the models with PMOT, while Fig. 4 depicts the models with RMOT. These simulations have been performed using suitable EPW files for each model: for Australia, Sydney; for Brazil, Florianópolis; for China, Turpan and Hong Kong; for Chile, Concepcion; for Spain, Madrid; for India, Ahmedabad; for international models (EN16798-1 and ASHRAE 55), London; for Japan, Tokyo; for Mexico, Chihuahua, Acapulco, Veracruz and Mexico City respectively for climates arid, dry tropical, humid tropical and temperate; and for Romania, Bucharest. The building energy model used for these has been the ASHRAE 90.1\u20132016 DOE Commercial Reference Building Prototype Small Office, since a typical building would be different for all countries and comfort models. Therefore, the purpose is the demonstration of the potential for parametric studies rather than the presentation of the simulation results. In all of these, different slopes of the heating and cooling setpoint temperatures can be observed, which shed light on the different capabilities of adaptation to the indoor environment of the people from these different areas. The only models which are not adaptive are CS_BRA Rupp AC, a model developed by Rupp et al [36] for air-condition spaces, and CS_ESP CTE, which is the Spanish Building Code. Except for the latter, all simulations have been performed using the 80% acceptability level (in case of the CS_INT EN16798, the equivalent category is II), and the ComfMod argument has taken the value 3, therefore horizontally extending the heating and cooling setpoint temperature when the PMOT or RMOT exceeded the applicability limits. The main advantage of this parameter is that it allows to select the comfort standard or model among a wide range of possibilities, considering not only international models, but also local models, and therefore the new possibilities it opens, since it allows to bring a totally novel field of research. 3.1.2 CAT: Occupant expectations or acceptability levels Secondly, the argument CAT allows the user to define the acceptability levels. Fig. 5 shows the different acceptability levels available, which depends on the ComfStand selected, since CAT has been developed by taking the thresholds and range values considered in each original model, referenced in Table 2. This figure shows on the left the CS_IND IMAC C NV model (which stands for India Model for Adaptive Comfort, specifically spaces with commercial use and natural ventilation), with 3 acceptability levels defined in the model: 80%, 85% and 90%, which are translated respectively into an offset of ±4.1 °C, ±3.3 °C and ±2.4 °C from neutral or comfort temperature; and, on the right, the CS_INT EN16798, also with 3 acceptability levels (although defined as categories or occupant expectation in the standard): 3, 2 and 1 (or III, II and I), which are projected respectively as an offset of −5°C and 4 °C, −4°C and 3 °C, and −3°C and 2 °C from neutral temperatures, for the heating and cooling setpoint temperatures. The available acceptability levels for each ComfStand can be consulted in Appendix A.2. The main advantage of this parameter is that it allows to easily select the acceptability levels to be applied to the setpoint temperatures. 3.1.3 ComfMod: Control of the setpoint temperature behavior Lastly, the argument ComfMod allows to control the behavior of the setpoint temperature. For almost all models, including the CS_IND IMAC C NV (Fig. 6 , left), the control of the behavior is as follows: - if ComfMod is 0, setpoint temperatures take the values of the PMV-based regulation or model relevant for each specific area; - if ComfMod is 1, 2 or 3, the adaptive model selected in ComfStand is used when PMOT or RMOT falls within applicability limits; otherwise, when it falls outside: o if ComfMod is 1, the previously explained PMV-based regulation or model relevant for that specific area is used; o if ComfMod is 2, PMV-based setpoint temperatures based on worldwide EN-ISO 7730 [61]; o If ComfMod is 3, the heating and cooling setpoint temperatures are horizontally extended. These exceptions are CS_ESP CTE, CS_INT EN16798 and CS_INT ASHRAE55, and the reason of these different controls is that this tool was initially designed to be used mainly in the Spanish energy framework. However, these are likely to change in the future for coherence with the other models. In case of CS_ESP CTE, there are no different controls based on ComfMod. In case of the international standards, the differences with the previously explained behavior occur when the PMOT or RMOT falls outside applicability limits. For clarity purposes, all behaviors for all models are shown in Appendix A.2. The main advantage of this parameter is that it allows to select the desired behavior of the setpoint temperatures: whether these should be static and take relevant values for that country based on national building energy regulations, or whether these should be adaptive, and in that case, the static setpoint temperatures that to be considered if the adaptive model falls out of the applicability range. 3.2 Demonstration of capabilities In this section, an example of the use of accim is shown with the purpose of demonstrating the capabilities of ACCIS and the Python library accim, as well as allowing the reader to replicate this section with its own IDF and EPW files. This example shows the recommended method for applying adaptive setpoint temperatures, which is the use of the Python library accim rather than the manual addition of the EMS script ACCIS to the IDF file. Considering Python 3.9 and EnergyPlus (any version from 9.0 to 22.2) must be previously installed, the first step is installing accim, if it is not already installed. To do this, the user needs to open a CMD terminal, and enter \u201cpip install accim\u201d. Afterwards, the second step is running Python or an integrated development environment (IDE), importing the library and calling the function. There are multiple procedures to do this, but one of the simplest is opening a CMD terminal pointing at the path where the IDF or IDFs to be transformed are located and then running Python by entering \u201cpython\u201d. In this case, the Small Office model as well as two copies of it with some modifications has been used, which have been renamed to Model_A, Model_B and Model_C. Then, the library should be imported and the function should be called, which can be done mainly by means of two different methods: - The shorter and easier method, designed mainly to be used by users without programming experience: with this method, the user will be asked to enter all the required information on the CMD terminal. The code to be entered is: - The longer method, which consists of the definition of all the required arguments when calling the function. The code to be entered, for the version of accim 0.6.2 is: In this case, the longer method has been used. The user have asked accim to generate output IDF files for the IDFs Model_A, Model_B and Model_C considering: - With regard to the comfort standard (ComfStand), the EN 16798-1, ASHRAE 55, the IMAC-C, and the local adaptive model developed by Ricardo Forgiarini Rupp et al. for Florianopolis (Brazil) [36] (respectively values 1, 2, 9 and 15); - With regard to the acceptability levels (CAT), all main expectations, which are categories I, II and III (values 1, 2 and 3) for EN16798-1, and 80 and 90% acceptability levels for ASHRAE 55 and IMAC-C and Brazilian model (values 80 and 90); - With regard to the behaviour of setpoints (ComfMod), all available types (values 0 to 3); - With regard to the building operation mode (HVACmode), full air conditioning and naturally ventilated (respectively values 0 and 1). The output IDFs are named based on the data the user have entered for the arguments joined with the characted \u201c[\u201c, so that it can be separated in categories in the data analytics stage, therefore following the pattern: Name[ComfStand[CAT[ComfMod[HVACmode[VentCtrl[VSToffset[MinOToffset[MaxWindSpeed[ASTtol[NameSuffix.idf Thus, an example is: Model_A[CS_BRA Rupp NV[CA_80[CM_0[HM_0[VC_X[VO_X[MT_X[MW_X[AT_0.1[NS_X.idf Where Model_A is the name; CS refers to ComfStand; CA refers to CAT; CM refers to ComfMod; HM refers to HVACmode; VC refers to VentCtrl; VO refers to VSToffset; MT refers to MinOToffset; MW refers to MaxWindSpeed; AT refers to ASTtol; and NS refers to the name suffix. Some of the arguments, which have not been mentioned in this study, are beyond the scope of ACCIS, since these are related to Python algorithms and EnergyPlus objects rather than merely EnergyManagementSystem objects. Nevertheless, all arguments are carefully explained in the documentation [60], open source and available for the user. As a result, the number of input IDFs was 3, and the size of each one 217 KBs, while the number of output IDFs has been 108 (full list in Appendix A.3) and the size of each one 546 KBs. The process has taken 18.32 s, although it depends on the number and size of the input IDFs and the performance of the computer. 4 Discussion The fact that adaptive setpoint temperatures are not first computed for a particular environment and then placed in the relevant Schedule:Compact object is one of the most significant benefits of ACCIS. Since EnergyPlus calculates and stores the running and prevailing mean outdoor temperatures values at the RMOT and PMOT sensors as the simulation runs, then use these values to calculate ACST and AHST, and finally override the Schedule:Compact values associated with the ThermostatSetpoint:DualSetpoint objects with the stored values for ACST and AHST, this code is applicable to simulations with any climate file. As a result, the availability of these sensors is necessary for ACCIS to function properly. As a consequence, based on the user-defined parameters ComfStand, CAT, and ComfMod, all potential setpoint temperatures are provided in Appendix A.2. It is important to remark the high customisation possibilities that ACCIS provides, since there are 165 available ComfStand-CAT-ComfMod combinations, and the remaining 7 arguments have not been studied in this research. All of these setpoint temperatures combine to create what can be referred to as \u201chybrid\u201d comfort models, which employ adaptive setpoint temperatures when the adaptive model is applicable and static setpoint temperatures when it is not (except when ComfMod is 0, which is entirely static). Because of ACCIS's potential for energy savings and the lengthy simulation runs it permits, it is now possible to conduct energy simulations on a global scale as opposed to only on a national or continental size. This instrument therefore creates new possibilities for enlarging the scope of numerous adaptive comfort research inquiries, such studies of energy poverty or mitigation strategies for climate change. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the proposed computational strategy is the first to do this, and it also enables faster completion of additional typical adaptive-setpoint simulations than any other technique. Additionally, this approach has been automated and designed to be simple to use. In contrast, other systems entail executing file management tasks for dozens or hundreds of EPW files and accurately simulating IDF files with adaptive setpoints with the appropriate EPW file. 5 Conclusions Adaptive setpoint temperatures might be a potential mean of enhancing a building's energy efficiency. Its potential for large energy savings has been widely shown. Nevertheless, the method used to carry out most of the studies related to adaptive setpoint temperatures was time-consuming and error-prone, given that most of the processes were carried out manually. This problem has recently been addressed using a computational technique known as ACCIS. There is currently no alternative method that can automate the process of applying adaptive setpoint temperatures. However, ACCIS had certain restrictions since a number of conditions had to be met in order for the procedure to be successful. In order to automate all of these activities, ACCIS has been nested in a Python module named accim. As a consequence, ACCIS converts PMV-based building energy models into adaptive setpoint building energy models in accordance with an IDF and the setup provided by the user. The main advantages of accim are: - The strong customizability potential: The user may change static setpoints into adaptive ones depending on 11 factors by using multiple arguments; - The ability to implement setpoints \u201con the fly\u201d: Previously, the daily setpoints had to be computed in preparation. With accim, however, this is no longer necessary because the EnergyManagementSystem objects compute the adaptive setpoints at the start of each simulation timestep. Following some earlier considerations, this research offers a thorough understanding of ACCIS by deconstructing the code into 4 stages: - Stage 1: the user adds the required EMS items and defines the input data for customising the adaptive setpoint simulation parameters. - Stage 2: the user-defined input data is applied by EMS programmes, and the global variables are computed and stored to build the framework of the customised adaptive setpoint simulation. - Stage 3, the global variables already computed in Stage 2 are used to override the setpoint schedule and the open or closed state of the windows. - Stage 4: the variables that will be reported are specified. Finally, the arguments ComfStand, CAT and ComfMod are studied, and the high customisation potential is presented, and the capabilities of accim are demonstrated, providing 108 IDFs with adaptive setpoints in less than 20 s. The extensive simulation runs it is possible to carry out with ACCIS and the potential energy savings open up new opportunities for doing global energy simulations as opposed to just national or regional ones. As a result, this tool broadens the scope of several studies on adaptive comfort, such as those looking at energy poverty or climate change mitigation.

        "dc:description": "Recent research has looked into the potential for energy savings from adopting setpoint temperatures based on adaptive comfort. The recently suggested Adaptive-Comfort-Control-Implementation Script (ACCIS), a computational method that expands the use of air conditioning to adaptive comfort, can be used to accomplish this. The user's setup and an Input Data File (IDF) are used by ACCIS to convert PMV-based EnergyPlus models into adaptive setpoint models. The Adaptive Comfort Control Implemented Model (\u201caccim\u201d) Python module has been used to nest ACCIS, which was originally an Energy Management System (EMS) script. This research focuses on the creation of ACCIS and offers a more in-depth understanding of how the computational method functions based on the connections between the objects that compose it. Since all weather file quantity constraints have been overcome and studies can now be generated based on millions of simulations, ACCIS opens up new opportunities for performing energy simulations on a worldwide scale rather than only on a national or continental level. This potential is increased considering that, until recently only international models ASHRAE Standard 55 and European standard EN16798-1 were considered in ACCIS, but now a recent update allows to select local comfort models developed for specific areas. As a result, this potential is firstly demonstrated by means of the study of the 3 arguments that have the most important impact on the setpoint temperatures: the thermal comfort model, the acceptability levels and the behaviour of setpoint temperatures when adaptive comfort models are not applicable; and secondly by means of an actual example of use of accim.",
