Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems are the largest consumers of energy in commercial and residential sectors. Minimizing their energy consumption without compromising indoor air quality and thermal comfort would result in environmental and financial benefits. However, most buildings still utilize constant air volume systems with on/off control to meet the thermal loads. Previous studies show that CO2-based demand-controlled ventilation is the most widely used strategy to determine the optimal level of supply air volume. Conventional CO2 mass balanced models, however, do not take the thermal comfort level into account. This paper aims to develop and implement a practical and efficient optimization framework to help office building designers and operators enhance thermal comfort and indoor air quality while minimizing energy costs for ventilation using demand-controlled ventilation. The objective function was constructed to consider thermal comfort indices, indoor air quality, and ventilation power demand. Long Short-Term Memory networks in conjunction with a generic algorithm optimization were utilized to generate the search spaces and solve the objective function. The proposed optimization strategy achieved near-optimal results within approximately 1 h of computation time. The findings indicate a reduction of the average ventilation power by 5.6% compared to the current on/off control approach and a slight increase of 0.25% in ventilation power when compared against the minimum ventilation rate recommended by ASHRAE. Additionally, the optimized approach leads to a saving of 26.9 kg per day of greenhouse gas emissions in terms of carbon dioxide equivalent.

Studies show that people in the US and Europe spend on average 85%\u201390% of their time indoors [1]. The buildings in which people stay account for 33% of the final energy consumption. The largest energy consumer in the building sector are the HVAC systems, utilizing about 50% of the total energy demand [2]. These systems are responsible for providing occupants with a comfortable and productive indoor environment. Given the substantial impacts of HVAC systems on energy use and human comfort, past research efforts have mainly focused on (1) the minimization of HVAC energy use without sacrificing the indoor air quality (IAQ) or (2) the optimization of thermal comfort [3]. Prior research has highlighted several inadequacies in current HVAC operations. These include conditioning of unoccupied spaces [4], assumptions of maximum zone occupancy [5], and over-conditioning of buildings despite the occupants\u2019 perspectives [6]. These shortcomings can be attributed to the fact that conventional HVAC operating modes do not consider the occupants' dynamics. Such modes include fixed operating schedules assuming full occupancy [7] and single-point air property measurements of zones [8]. These sub-optimal circumstances are primarily due to ineffective operating modes of HVAC systems. As an alternative to replacing existing HVAC units with more efficient ones, authors in Ref. [9] have proposed that enhancing control strategies is a more practical and cost-effective solution. Consequently, improving HVAC systems through demand-controlled ventilation (DCV) represents an effective approach to reduce energy consumption. DCV systems regulate the ventilation rate based on occupancy patterns, which can generate substantial energy savings relative to conventional ventilation systems that deliver a constant amount of air regardless of occupancy [10\u201312]. The most prevalent DCV control strategy involves the utilization of CO2 concentration. The CO2-based DCV has garnered significant attention from the HVAC industry ever since its initial development. Over time, this approach has evolved and expanded from simple single-zone systems to more intricate system configurations found in commercial buildings [13]. According to the study conducted by Laverge et al., the DCV strategy involved modifying the opening size of trickle ventilators based on the room's CO2 concentration, resulting in significant reductions in ventilation heat loss from 25% to 60% [14]. In situations where real-time occupancy information is unavailable, utilizing CO2 as the trace gas can be a valuable approach to estimate the ventilation requirements for the breathing zone. Chan et al. [15] utilized the steady-state method to estimate the per-person ventilation rate by relying on daily maximum CO2 concentrations in a multi-zone system comprising 94 classrooms located in California, USA. Similarly, Oliveira et al. [16] employed the CO2 concentration decay method to estimate the ventilation rate of a single test room. Numerous studies have shown a significant correlation between indoor CO2 concentration and occupancy level. Some of these studies have also noted the presence of a time delay in the change of CO2 concentration relative to occupancy changes [13]. To enhance the efficacy of DCV, several researchers have explored occupancy detection methods involving the utilization of CO2 measurements. Calì et al. [17] proposed an algorithm based on the mass balance equation of indoor CO2 concentrations for detecting occupancy. The algorithm achieved an accuracy of 80.6% in correctly identifying the number of occupants. Jiang et al. [18] developed a dynamic model to estimate the real-time number of indoor occupants using CO2 measurements. The model achieved an accuracy of up to 94% with a tolerance of four occupants in the room. Pedersen et al. [19] proposed a novel plug-and-play occupancy detection method that utilized data from multiple sensors, including CO2 sensors. They achieved an accuracy of 98% and 78% when testing the method in a single room and a three-bedroom apartment, respectively. Yang and Becerik-Gerber [20] demonstrated that occupancy-based HVAC schedules could lead to energy savings of up to 9%. Agarwal et al. [21] proposed a low-cost system to detect the presence and absence of occupants in office areas accurately. They further showed that energy savings between 10% and 15% are achievable with the detected occupancy information. The model's accuracy ranged from 85% to 93.2% depending on different observation states. However, the implementation of DCV may negatively impact the thermal comfort of the zone. This is due to the adjustment of the ventilation rate based on occupancy patterns, which affects the temperature and humidity of the air supplied to the zone [22]. Therefore, careful consideration and optimization of DCV control algorithms is necessary to ensure the overall performance of the HVAC system while maintaining the desired level of thermal comfort and indoor air quality. There are various methods available to optimize HVAC systems. One effective approach is to utilize model-based optimization methods, such as model predictive control (MPC), which can optimize HVAC system performance. Taheri et al. [23] reviewed the benefit of using MPC model of the HVAC system to forecast future behavior and adjust control inputs based on future predictions. Another method is to use machine learning tools to optimize HVAC system design and operation. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are machine learning tools that process data similar to what a human brain does. Researchers can use ANNs to build linear and nonlinear models for time series. ANN models are widely accepted as an effective tools for fitting functions in different applications [24\u201327]. For example, Ryu and Moon [28] developed a machine-learning-based occupancy prediction model using indoor and outdoor CO2 concentration data. The model's accuracy ranged from 85% to 93.2% depending on different observation states. Taheri and Razban [29] compared various prediction algorithms and found that machine learning with multilayer perceptron outperformed other methods. Mtibaa et al. [30] presents a long short-term memory model for accurate indoor air temperature predictions in multi-zone buildings, outperforming multilayer perceptron models by reducing the prediction error by 50% in real smart buildings with variable air volume system. Li et al. [31] proposed a deep neural network-based prediction model to optimize the ventilation control in advance. Afroz et al. [32] employed a combination of neural network and particle swarm optimization techniques to optimize the HVAC systems, resulting in a 7.8% reduction in energy consumption without compromising the indoor conditions. Other optimization techniques include the utilization of Genetic Algorithms (GAs). Based on evolutionary principles and natural selection, the technique entails setting up a populace of possible solutions that are subsequently refined through iterative evaluations until the most efficient solution is determined. In related works, Elsheikh et al. [33] developed a multi-objective genetic algorithm model for Egypt's major climates, optimizing design variables including building materials, envelope features, window to wall ratio, orientation, and HVAC parameters. The study achieved balanced reductions in energy consumption and life cycle costs for all climates. Nasruddin et al. [34] employed a combination of artificial neural network and genetic algorithm to optimize the operation of a two-chiller HVAC system in a building. The study revealed that ANN showed a strong correlation between decision variables and the objective function, while GA efficiently offered several alternative design variables to achieve an optimal system in terms of thermal comfort and annual energy consumption. In summary, machine learning tools are very popular in predicting and optimizing HVAC systems. The given results are promising and therefore it is applicable to use them to optimize DCV without compromising the thermal comfort of the occupants and IAQ in the space. The implementation of DCV systems has been studied extensively in the above literature. However, most of these approaches have focused primarily on utilizing IAQ indicators as constraints, with less emphasis on the impact of ventilation rates on thermal comfort within the occupied zone. In real-world scenarios, the rate of ventilation can significantly affect the temperature and overall comfort levels experienced by occupants. Therefore, the objective of this research is to develop an approach that takes into account both IAQ and occupant thermal comfort while minimizing the energy consumed by the ventilation system. The remainder of this manuscript is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the test environment and outlines the data collection protocol. Section 3 describes the methodology, explaining all the equations and formulas utilized in this study. Section 4 presents the results from the optimization and provides a discussion of the findings. Lastly, Section 5 offers the conclusion. 2 Data collection protocol In this section, we describe the test environment used in this study, as well as the data collection method that was conducted to analyze occupancy levels and HVAC energy performance. 2.1 Defining the test environment The research was conducted in an auditorium located on a university campus. The five-story building comprises auditoriums, office spaces, and medical laboratories. The specific auditorium of interest is positioned at the center of the building. Fig. 1 depicts the three-dimensional layouts of the zone from various viewing angles, providing visual representations of the spatial arrangement. Fig. 2 displays the schematic diagram of the HVAC system, illustrating the arrangement of its components and the location of sensors. The auditorium is designed to accommodate a maximum seating capacity of 182 occupants and is primarily used for lectures and seminars. It has a volume of 1,400 m3 and a floor area of 306 m3. The zone has three entrances but no windows. The conditioned air is supplied through six diffusers mounted on the suspended ceiling, while the air is returned through sidewall and fore ceiling-mounted square grilles. The HVAC system consists of a primary air handling unit (AHU) and a recirculation system. The primary AHU, which is a variable air volume (VAV) system, is equipped with two identical supply fans. On the other hand, the recirculation system operates as a constant air volume (CAV) system. The primary AHU receives 100% outdoor air (OA) and distributes it to multiple zones, including the auditorium. Despite being a variable VAV system, the primary AHU operates exclusively in two fixed control positions: fully on and 70% on, according to a predetermined schedule. In occupied mode, which spans from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m., the primary fan operates at its maximum capacity. Conversely, during unoccupied mode, it runs at 70% of its full capacity. In occupied mode, the ventilation air damper remains fully open, enabling approximately 1,000 L/s of outdoor air to enter the zone. This outdoor air is subsequently mixed with the recirculated air of 500 L/s, resulting in a total discharge air flow rate of approximately 1,500 L/s. The zone temperature, when occupied, is allowed to vary between 21 °C and 24 °C, with a setpoint of 23 °C. In unoccupied mode, the ventilation air damper remains closed, preventing outdoor air from entering the zone. The relief air damper functions in proportion to the ventilation air damper to maintain minimal pressure variation within the zone. It is important to note that there are no boiler or chiller loops connected to the AHUs, as both utilities are sourced externally from the campus. The study included college students aged 18 to 23, along with 1\u20132 lecturers or speakers of different age groups. The participants attended face-to-face lectures in the auditorium, where the activities were limited to sedentary behavior. No physical activities, except walking, were observed. It was assumed that the students were in good health and had a stable metabolism, resulting in the exhalation of a standard amount of CO2. 2.2 Data collection To analyze occupancy levels and HVAC energy performance, data were collected using a combination of IoT sensors and the Building Management System (BMS). The sensors were placed throughout the building to measure room CO2 concentrations, temperature, ventilation power demand, ventilation airflow rate, and occupancy levels. They were integrated with the BMS to collect and analyze data in real-time. The integrated IoT monitoring sensors consisted of a power meter, three CO2 sensors, an IoT gateway, cloud storage, and a dashboard. All sensors were capable of wireless communication using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology. The power meter was connected to the primary fan to measure its power factor, active power (kW), and energy consumption (kWh), covering a voltage range of 90\u2013600 VAC with an accuracy of 0.5%. The CO2 sensors were self-calibrating non-dispersive infrared types, capable of measuring a range of 0\u20135000 ppm with an accuracy of ±5%. The gateway facilitated the transfer of readings to the cloud storage at intervals as short as 1 min, and the readings were displayed and could be downloaded through the online dashboard. The BMS was utilized to gather data on temperature and volumetric airflow. The BMS used in the study was Metasys, developed by Johnson Controls. This system allowed users to coordinate control over various systems in the commercial building, including HVAC, lighting, security, and protection systems. Furthermore, the BMS collected and stored data that could be utilized for decision-making purposes. The data collection was conducted from September 27th to January 7th of the following year. The CO2 and energy data were downloaded from the IoT cloud storage, along with the temperature and volumetric airflow from the BMS. The number of occupants in the auditorium was manually counted, and the occupancy data was further validated against the class enrollment information provided by the university. We were given permission to adjust the damper position, which allowed us to collect data that falls outside the normal operating conditions. The granularity of the data was chosen to be 15 min. Fig. 2 illustrates the location of sensors, including both pre-embedded sensors and the sensors integrated into the system for the purpose of this research. In Fig. 3 the majority of the CO2 data falls within the range of 425 ppm\u2013725 ppm. Some outliers were observed as a result of manipulating the ventilation system to gather alternative data points beyond the normal operating conditions. which prevents it from adequately responding to larger classes that occur a few times per week. The zone temperature is recorded between the range of 21.8\u201325.6° Celsius. The power demand for the ventilation fans ranges from 38 kW to 46 kW, with a median value of 41 kW. 3 Methodology The methodology for optimizing ventilation energy with respect to thermal comfort and CO2 concentration involves a multi-step approach. First, data on occupancy levels, temperature, and CO2 concentrations are collected using a combination of IoT sensors and the BMS. These data are then analyzed to detect patterns and trends in occupancy, temperature, and CO2 concentrations using the ANN. Subsequently, optimizations are performed to determine the optimal settings for the ventilation system. The aim is to provide the necessary fresh air while minimizing energy consumption and ensuring both thermal comfort and IAQ are maintained. The research considered four models: 1) mass balance equation, 2) indoor thermal condition model, 3) artificial neural network, and 4) genetic algorithm. The mass balance equation and the thermal condition model were used to determine the baseline conditions for IAQ and thermal comfort. The artificial neural network was utilized to predict the CO2 concentrations and zone temperature, which are important factors for determining ventilation requirements. The genetic algorithm was employed to optimize the ventilation system's settings, which can help minimize energy consumption while maintaining IAQ and thermal comfort. Thus, each model played a crucial role in the research's overall methodology and helped to achieve its objective. 3.1 Mass balance equation The indoor CO2 concentration level can be represented by a differential equation that takes into account the difference in CO2 concentration between the discharge airflow and the return airflow, as well as the CO2 generation per occupant. This CO2 mass balance equation can be expressed as Eq. (1) [35], (1) v d C z d t = P z G + V o z C o − V r C r where v is the space volume (L), C r is the CO2 concentrations in the return airflow (ppm/106), P z is the number of occupants in the zone, G is the average CO2 generation rate per person (L/s-person), V o z is the outdoor airflow (L/s), C o is the outdoor CO2 concentrations (ppm/106), and V r is the recirculation airflow (L/s). Although Eq. (1) is solvable via simple integration, it is more convenient to discretize the equation when it comes to application. The method assumes that the CO2 derivative represents the rate of change of concentrations between the current and the previous sampling instants, as expressed in Eq. (2), (2) v C z i − C z i − 1 Δ t = P z G + V d z C d z − V r C r where Δ t is the timestep difference and i is the current timestep. 3.2 Thermal comfort consideration The Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) model is widely adapted to determine a zone's thermal condition for mechanically ventilated buildings [36\u201340]. According to ASHRAE, the PMV is a dimensionless index which predicts the mean value of the thermal sensation votes of a large group of people [41]. The PMV model recommended by the ASHRAE, however, has several limitations as it risks to inaccurately predict thermal comfort levels in a stratum-ventilated room with elevated zone air velocity [40]. The auditorium in this study has supply air diffusers installed on the ceiling and a return grille at the head level of the occupants, creating higher air movement at the occupant's head level. Furthermore, the original formula of the PMV requires 6 parameters [40], including clothing insulation and metabolism rate of occupants, which are difficult to quantify. Additionally, the original formula uses room air velocity, which is challenging to analyze without employing additional software. As a result, this research adopts a modified PMV model proposed by Zhang et al. to estimate the thermal comfort level in the auditorium. The modified PMV requires only 3 parameters and replacing the room air velocity with the supply air velocity, and the study shows the correlation between the original model and the modified one is 0.998 [40]. Eq. (2) and Eq. (3) show this regression-based model with fixed dimensionless coefficients, (3) P M V m = − 7 91300 N T z 2 + 19 50 T z − 689 74 (4) N = 3600 × V d z v where P M V m is the modified PMV, N is the air change per hour (ACH), T Z is the zone air temperature (°C), V z is the zone discharge airflow (m3/s), and v is the volume of the zone (m3). Whereas PMV assumes an occupant's thermal sensation in air-conditioned environments, Fanger introduced another index called the Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied (PPD), which allows for the quantitative prediction of the percentage of thermally dissatisfied people [38]. One advantage of using the PPD is that it does not focus on the mean thermal perception of the conditioned space but rather accounts for the difference in expectation over a sample of occupants. Additionally, the PPD can be a more useful metric in situations where the goal is to minimize the number of people who feel dissatisfied with the thermal environment. In such situations, it may be more important to focus on reducing the number of dissatisfied individuals rather than achieving a specific average level of thermal comfort [42]. The relationship between the PMV and the PPD is described by Eq. (4). (5) P P D = 100 − 95 × e ( − 0.03353 ( P M V m ) 4 − 0.2179 ( P M V m ) 2 ) 3.3 Machine learning algorithms This research employed Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural networks (RNN) architecture, to approximate the nonlinear relationship between inputs and outputs in time-series prediction tasks. Traditional ANNs only employ feed-forward multilayer perceptron; however, many research have recommended the use of RNNs because they can retain temporal variation throughout an entire time series [43]. LSTMs are known for their ability to capture long-term dependencies and retain information over extended periods, facilitated by their unique memory cell structure. These cells consist of three main components: the input gate, the forget gate, and the output gate. The input gate determines which information from the current input should be stored in the memory cell, while the forget gate decides which information from the previous time step should be discarded. Finally, the output gate regulates which information from the memory cell should be passed to the next layer or used as the output [44]. They can learn to predict future values in a time series based on past values and can handle variable-length input sequences, making them widely used in energy consumption predictions [45\u201347]. A GA was used to optimize the control parameters of a DCV system by iteratively testing different combinations of parameters to identify the optimal set that minimizes energy consumption while maintaining a desired indoor air quality level. Using a GA to optimize the control parameters of a DCV system can result in significant energy savings while maintaining indoor air quality [33,34]. The approach can also adapt to changing occupancy patterns and environmental conditions, allowing the DCV system to continuously optimize its performance over time. MATLAB was deployed as the software platform to develop LSTM and GA optimization. MATLAB's compatibility with GPU allows us to take advantage of parallel processing, significantly speeding up the computation time to reach near-optimal results. Additionally, MATLAB provides convenient visualization capabilities, enabling us to analyze and interpret the results effectively [48]. Table 1 shows the computer hardware for developing the machine learning algorithms. 3.4 Constraints Optimization can be only realized by considering the relevant variables and the appropriate constraints. For DCV the main objective is to minimize the energy use of the fan with the constraints of indoor CO2 concentration and thermal comfort level. The first constraint is IAQ, which is affected by the CO2 concentration. Previously, the ASHRAE Standard 62\u20131989 [49] recommended an indoor CO2 level of 1,000 ppm to satisfy comfort criteria. This recommendation was later dropped in the ASHRAE Standard 62\u20131999 by eliminating the absolute level of 1,000 ppm CO2 concentration. Instead, a 700 indoor-outdoor CO2 concentration differential was established [50]. Previous studies have shown that outdoor CO2 concentrations typically range from 300 to 500 ppm [51,52]. Therefore, according to the latest ANSI/ASHRAE standard indoor CO2 concentrations no greater than 1200 ppm will satisfy about 80% of occupants. The second constraint is the minimum ventilation required by a thermal space according to its function and occupancy. Under the principles of ASHRAE Standard 62.1 2019 the required outdoor airflow formula is given as Eq. (5) [53]. Additionally, because the auditorium has a dual-duct dual-fan system the outdoor airflow is combined with a constant recirculation airflow of 1,000 L/s to generate the discharge airflow directed into the zone, as shown in Eq. (7), (6) V b z = R p P z + R a A z (7) V d z = V r + V o z where V b z is the required outdoor fresh airflow (L/s), R p is the outdoor airflow required per person (L/s/person), P z is the number of occupants in the ventilation zone during use, R a is the outdoor airflow per unit area (L/s/m2), and A z is the occupiable floor area of the thermal zone (m2). V d z is the discharge airflow (L/s), V r is the recirculation airflow (L/s), and V o z is the outdoor airflow (L/s). The Standard also dictates that the minimum outdoor airflow per person in a lecture hall is 3.8 L/s-person and the minimum outdoor airflow per area is 0.3 L/s/m2. Lastly, because the discharge airflow also affects the thermal condition of the zone, this research also considered the PPD values as the third constraint. ASHRAE Standard 55 determines that the acceptable thermal environment when more than 80% of the human occupants are thermally comfortable. In other words, the PPD should be maintained at or less than 10% [41]. 3.5 Optimization framework Genetic algorithm optimization with one objective function was employed in the research. The average power demand of the fan was selected to be the objective function. The zone discharge airflow was chosen to be sole decision variable that could vary freely. Because changing the zone discharge flowrate also had effect on the IAQ and thermal comfort assessment indices, and indices have requirement to comply with, these requirements acted as constraints during the process. Hence, the procedure of the optimization conducted in this research is presented in Fig. 4 . The process begins with the estimation of the constraint functions, namely the CO2 concentration and room temperature. The datasets were used to train, validate, and test the LSTM in order to find the correlation between the constraint functions and the ventilation power demand. The indoor CO2 concentration was allowed below 1,200 ppm; the minimum airflow was determined using Eq. (5); and the PPD should always be smaller than 10%. 4 Results and discussion 4.1 ANN prediction model ANN-based prediction models were developed using LSTM to establish relationships between occupancy level and discharge airflow and two constraint parameters: CO2 concentration and temperature of the zone. Additionally, a model was created to estimate the power demand of the primary fans that were affected based on the change of zone discharge airflow. The training of all models utilized 70% of the dataset, while 15% of the dataset was used for validation, and the remaining 15% was used for testing. The models were presented in this section shown in Fig. 5 to Fig. 7 . The evaluation of these models was conducted using two metrics: R-squared and root-mean-squared-error (RMSE). The metrics are calculated using Eq. (6) and Eq. (7), respectively, where N represents the number of datasets; t i is a target value; t \u203e is the average value of t in the dataset; p j is a predicted value. (8) R 2 = 1 − ∑ i N ∑ ( t i − p i ) 2 ∑ i N ∑ ( t i − t \u203e ) 2 (9) R M S E = 1 N ∑ i N ( t i − p i ) 2 Fig. 5 displays a plot depicting the predicted CO2 concentrations of the zone compared to the measured CO2 concentrations. The predicted CO2 concentrations were estimated using the occupancy and the outdoor airflow. The model yielded an R-squared value of 0.95 and an RMSE of 16 ppm. Fig. 6 shows the comparison between the predicted zone temperature and the measured zone temperature in degrees Celsius. The predicted zone temperature was estimated using the zone CO2 concentrations and the discharge airflow as input variables. The model has an R-squared value of 0.98 and an RMSE of 0.23° Celsius. Fig. 7 shows the comparison between the predicted fan power and the measured fan power in kilowatts. The predicted fan power was estimated using the outdoor airflow. The model has an R-squared value of 0.90 and an RMSE of 0.22 kW. Table 2 summarizes model results. 4.2 Optimization result The GA was utilized to optimize the impact of implementing DCV on zone CO2 concentration and thermal comfort. This optimization process involved the utilization of one decision variable and three constraint functions. The GA parameters were set as follows: a population size of 50, a crossover fraction of 0.8, and a maximum number of iterations of 5,000 [34]. The figures presented below depict the results obtained from the GA ventilation optimization conducted on September 30th, from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m., during which the system was set to the occupied mode. Fig. 8 illustrates the outdoor airflow directed into the zone during the occupied mode of the system. The baseline outdoor airflow scenario maintained a constant airflow rate of approximately 1,000 L/s. The minimum outdoor airflow strategy was determined based on the zone's area and the occupant counts at 15-min intervals, as per Eq. (6). This strategy resulted in an outdoor airflow rate of approximately 166 L/s during the specified period. In contrast, the optimized strategy required 192 L/s of outdoor airflow on average, representing a 15% increase compared to the minimum outdoor airflow strategy. However, even with this increase, the optimized strategy still achieved an 80% reduction in outdoor airflow compared to the baseline scenario. Fig. 9 shows the CO2 concentrations simulated for the optimization period. In the baseline scenario, where over-ventilation occurred, the CO2 concentrations consistently remained below the recommended limit of 1,200 ppm. However, the minimum outdoor airflow strategy did not effectively manage CO2 concentrations when the zone was fully occupied, resulting in CO2 concentrations exceeding 1,200 ppm on 5 occasions. In contrast, the implementation of the optimized strategy demonstrated the ability to maintain CO2 concentrations below the specified limit. Fig. 10 presents the simulated PPD for each scenario. In the baseline scenario, the PPD tends to decrease when the zone is occupied and increase when the space is unoccupied. Due to over-ventilation, the PPD is relatively low when the zone is occupied, despite the zone temperature dropping too low when the space is unoccupied, leading to energy waste. In the minimum OA scenario, the system struggles to maintain a comfortable temperature, resulting in the PPD exceeding 10% when the zone is fully occupied. However, the optimized strategy adjusts the ventilation airflow during this period to keep the PPD below 10%, as illustrated in the figure. Fig. 11 presents the power demand of the primary fans used to introducing outdoor air to the zones during the occupied mode. The power usage simulated at a 15-min interval based on the discharge airflow rates. The baseline OA scenario exhibited an average power consumption of 43.1 kW, while the minimum OA scenario and the optimized OA scenario had average power consumptions of 40.6 kW and 40.7 kW, respectively. The optimized scenario achieved a 5.6% reduction in power consumption compared to the baseline, with a marginal increase in power of only 0.25% from the minimum OA scenario. The total energy usage of the fans in the baseline scenario was 668 kWh, whereas the minimum OA scenario and the optimized OA scenario resulted in energy usages of 629 kWh and 630 kWh, respectively. Based on the calculations provided by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the equivalent carbon emissions saved from the minimum OA scenario and the optimized OA scenario are 27.6 kg and 26.9 kg, respectively [54]. One thing to note is that the reduction in energy was not as significant as the reduction in ventilation flow rate. This is because the fans were also used to bring fresh air to other breathing zones during the same period. The relationship between the change in outdoor airflow to the auditorium and the power demand of the fans is not linear. Table 3 summarizes the results, demonstrating that the optimized OA scenario not only meets the IAQ and thermal comfort recommendations but also achieves high energy efficiency. 5 Conclusion The developed approach provides an optimization assessment framework for ventilation energy management in real-time demand response program. In the framework, a GA-based approach was developed to investigate demand-controlled implementation for an auditorium located on a university campus. Results indicate that there is significant potential for energy and cost savings by controlling indoor air conditions within acceptable levels of thermal comfort and air quality as evaluated according to the predicted percentage of dissatisfied and the CO2 concentration, respectively. The optimized scenario was compared to both the baseline scenario and the minimum ventilation scenario prescribed by the ASHRAE minimum ventilation standards. The comparison revealed a potential for demand reductions, with a decrease of 5.6% in average kW compared to the baseline scenario. Additionally, the optimized scenario exhibited a reduction of 26.9 kg of greenhouse gas emissions in terms of carbon dioxide equivalent, in comparison to the baseline scenario. Conversely, when compared to the ASHRAE minimum ventilation scenario, the optimized scenario showed a slight increase of 0.25% in average kW. While the minimum ventilation standard designed by the ASHARE can reduce the ventilation energy more it does not consider the thermal criteria inside a breathing zone. Despite the insights gained from this study, several limitations should be acknowledged. Firstly, the study focused on a specific building, and the results may not be directly applicable to all types of buildings or HVAC systems. Different building layouts, occupancy patterns, and ventilation requirements may lead to different optimization outcomes. Furthermore, the study solely considered CO2 concentrations and thermal comfort, and other IAQ parameters such as volatile organic compounds were not taken into account. Finally, the optimization process was based on historical data, and the real-time implementation and control strategies may introduce uncertainties and practical challenges. Future research should address these limitations and extend the investigation to diverse building types and scenarios to provide more comprehensive and robust optimization guidelines for DCV systems. The study presented a solution that can be applied to establish optimal control of thermal zones in buildings without the heavy use of sensors. It was demonstrated that there is an unexplored potential for DCV strategies which could be intelligently integrated in the operation of such systems and smart grids in the future. However, there is great potential for reducing the time for GA convergence, since satisfactory near-optimal results were, in most cases, obtained in about an hour. Nevertheless, a careful adjustment of optimization parameters and constraints combined with variable predictions, along with the evolution of computer resources and microprocessor capabilities, may make the proposed approach deployable in real time in the near future. In conclusion, this study presents a state-of-the-art approach that combines ANN-based sequence-to-sequence regression algorithms and genetic algorithm optimization to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of DCV systems. By establishing relationships between CO2 concentration and occupancy, as well as CO2 concentration and zone temperature, the research expands the search spaces, leading to more accurate and robust DCV system optimization. The integration of genetic algorithm optimization proves highly effective in improving HVAC system performance through optimal ventilation rates and minimized energy consumption, resulting in energy savings and better indoor conditions. Moreover, this approach enables retrofitting of existing buildings, reducing costs, greenhouse gas emissions, and improving access to energy-efficient HVAC solutions. These findings highlight the potential of the proposed approach for sustainable and efficient HVAC operations, addressing environmental concerns, and ensuring occupant comfort and well-being.

        "dc:description": "Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems are the largest consumers of energy in commercial and residential sectors. Minimizing their energy consumption without compromising indoor air quality and thermal comfort would result in environmental and financial benefits. However, most buildings still utilize constant air volume systems with on/off control to meet the thermal loads. Previous studies show that CO2-based demand-controlled ventilation is the most widely used strategy to determine the optimal level of supply air volume. Conventional CO2 mass balanced models, however, do not take the thermal comfort level into account. This paper aims to develop and implement a practical and efficient optimization framework to help office building designers and operators enhance thermal comfort and indoor air quality while minimizing energy costs for ventilation using demand-controlled ventilation. The objective function was constructed to consider thermal comfort indices, indoor air quality, and ventilation power demand. Long Short-Term Memory networks in conjunction with a generic algorithm optimization were utilized to generate the search spaces and solve the objective function. The proposed optimization strategy achieved near-optimal results within approximately 1 h of computation time. The findings indicate a reduction of the average ventilation power by 5.6% compared to the current on/off control approach and a slight increase of 0.25% in ventilation power when compared against the minimum ventilation rate recommended by ASHRAE. Additionally, the optimized approach leads to a saving of 26.9 kg per day of greenhouse gas emissions in terms of carbon dioxide equivalent.",
