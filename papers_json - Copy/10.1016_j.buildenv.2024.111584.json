The abrupt surge in electricity consumption for air-conditioning (AC) in rural areas has exacerbated the rural power supply and demand imbalance, presenting a significant challenge to the reliability and stability of power provision in rural low-voltage grids. Implementing power demand response (DR) in buildings is recognized as an effective solution to address the grid's power imbalance and reliability issues. Among various building DR strategies, direct load control (DLC) stands out as a proficient approach to rapidly curtail building AC loads. However, applying this method solely to individual rural buildings proves less effective in peak regulation (PR). To fully exploit the DR potential of AC systems in rural building complex, it is essential to scale up the application of DLC. Consequently, a DLC-based DR optimal scheduling strategy is proposed for rural building complex AC systems. This strategy aims to meet PR demand and maximize the benefits for load aggregator. It establishes four DLC methods and differential compensation mechanisms, taking into account the varying thermal comfort requirements of AC users. The DR optimization model is solved using a genetic algorithm (GA), with PR demand derived from long and short-term memory neural network predictions. To validate the proposed strategy, a simulation study is conducted on a 200-unit farmhouse AC system, utilizing a typical rural soil source heat pump system in Xi'an, Shaanxi Province. The results demonstrate that the strategy surpasses the PR target by approximately 6.65 % during the DR period, while ensuring a minimum level of thermal comfort for all user categories. Additionally, it yields a PR benefit of 88.73 yuan per day for all users, thereby promoting the adoption of clean energy in rural areas.

This upsurge comes with its challenges, as the output from renewable sources is inherently dependent on weather conditions, introducing difficulties in ensuring a consistent and reliable power supply. The burgeoning demand for electricity further complicates the delicate balance between grid supply and demand, with any imbalance risking the reliability and quality of electricity service [2]. In the realm of building energy consumption, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems emerge as significant contributors, accounting for approximately 48 % of the energy usage in public buildings, thereby exacerbating peak load pressures on the grid [3]. In response, demand response (DR) programs have been developed to address the imbalance between power supply and demand, fostering both grid stability and consumer benefits while facilitating the integration of renewable sources [4,5]. Furthermore, DR initiatives play a pivotal role in driving smart grid innovations [6]. The average number of air-conditioning (AC) units in rural areas, paralleling the rise in incomes and access to electricity, has markedly increased from 34.2 units per 100 households in 2014 to 73.8 units in 2020 [7]. This uptrend imposes significant strain on rural electrical infrastructures, markedly elevating electrical loads and spotlighting a pivotal challenge for the stability of rural low-voltage grids. Furthermore, residential AC systems, which substantially influence electricity costs and the equilibrium of power supply and demand, are integral to DR for buildings [8\u201310]. Consequently, it is essential to explore the DR potential of rural AC loads and develop DR strategies specifically designed for rural residential buildings. Such strategies aim not only to alleviate the mismatch between electricity supply and demand but also to facilitate the assimilation of renewable energy into rural power grids, thus contributing to the achievement of rural carbon neutrality objectives. A rational and effective DR control strategy is essential to fully harness and utilize the potential of AC systems in the residential sector. Direct load control (DLC) emerges as a viable DR strategy for swiftly reducing building AC loads [11,12], attracting increased attention from DR users. DLC empowers utilities to directly manage designated customer equipment, offering predetermined incentives [13,14]. Xue et al. [15] developed a rapid chiller power DR control strategy, significantly reducing HVAC system demand by approximately 32.04%\u201366.45 %. Wang et al. introduced a supply-based feedback control strategy to address the issue of disordered cooling distribution during DR events caused by direct chiller power control strategy [16], as well as the rebound problem after DR events [17]. Xiong et al. [18] integrated transactive control with active thermal energy storage, crafting a holistic DR strategy that allows for real-time temperature modifications in response to power market bids. Li et al. [19] innovated a DLC technique for the dynamic alteration of room temperatures, employing the heat balance equation and thermal comfort models as benchmarks, demonstrating electricity consumption savings of 2.8 % and operating cost reductions of 3.73 % over fixed temperature settings. Tang et al. [20] devised a DLC scheme for optimizing and resetting building power using a commercial building AC system, managing to achieve approximately 23 % power reduction during DR occurrences whilst maintaining zone temperatures at acceptable levels. The aforementioned preceding studies on DLC primarily focus on the formulation of different DLC strategies and their associated impact on DR peak regulation. However, they tend to overlook the collective DR effect generated by the amalgamation of these DLC strategies. In reality, the load of single residential building AC users is minimal, resulting in a negligible overall grid load reduction through DLC. Consequently, in practical DR projects, it becomes imperative to aggregate multiple buildings into clusters, forming a substantial user base that can receive coordinated scheduling from DR decision makers. Extensive research has been conducted on the optimal DR scheduling strategy among buildings. Chen et al. [21] proposed a DR approach for residential buildings that employs optimal scheduling through a non-dominated ranking genetic algorithm (GA) II, managing a 25 % reduction in peak nighttime loads while maintaining comfort levels for inhabitants. Zhang et al. [22] developed an optimal load scheduling strategy based on multi-agent system coordination for managing DR in building complex. This strategy takes into account dynamic electricity prices and marginal emission factors. José Adrián et al. [23] developed a DLC strategy that uniformly adjusts AC temperatures to lower peak grid loads in markets without price incentives, though it did not account for differences in thermal comfort. Li et al. [24] advanced DR scheduling for commercial settings with a time-series 0\u20131 planning approach, markedly improving DR efficiency of the building complex. Farbod et al. [25] proposed a day-ahead optimization model for building complexes, emphasizing AC electricity consumption predictions to achieve cost reductions up to nearly 8 % without sacrificing indoor comfort. Pavlak et al. [26] utilized Model Predictive Control for synchronized DR optimal scheduling in building complexes, while Kurucz et al. [27] applied Linear Programming (LP) for user scheduling in DLC to determine the optimal number of users to participate in the DLC scheme. However, the majority of the current optimal scheduling strategies for building complex in the field of DR primarily revolve around urban public building complex. Furthermore, the few studies that do consider residential buildings are limited to those within city limits, resulting in a lack of research on rural building complex. Additionally, the focus of most studies is predominantly on summer cooling, leaving a gap in research on winter heating. These deficiencies will be rectified in the present study. Furthermore, load forecasting plays a crucial role in ensuring the efficient and stable operation of the power system's DR strategy. By accurately predicting power load, the operating conditions of the power system can be anticipated in advance, thus providing valuable insights for the scheduling and regulation of the power system's DR. Numerous studies have proposed machine learning methods for building energy consumption prediction, which exhibit reliable and highly accurate results [28]. Among these methods, neural networks, known for their self-learning capabilities and ability to fit nonlinear patterns, have become one of the most widely used techniques for load forecasting [29\u201331]. Recently, deep neural networks, distinguished by their extensive layers beyond conventional neural frameworks, effectively handle complex nonlinear patterns [32,33]. In the realm of deep learning, recurrent neural networks (RNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks are frequently employed for electric load forecasting, owing to their superior ability to capture non-smooth load data patterns. Notably, load forecasting using recurrent neural network algorithms demonstrated better performance in terms of root mean square error [34,35], despite encountering gradient explosion that can negatively impact prediction accuracy. In contrast, LSTM effectively addresses these issues [36,37], a fact Booktief et al. [38] underscored through the demonstration of LSTM's remarkable load forecasting accuracy. Kong et al. [39] introduced an LSTM-based framework for residential load prediction that exhibited superior prediction performance within their dataset, while Mohmood H et al. [40] developed a multi-step LSTM algorithm for building electrical load forecasts, surpassing both generalized regression neural network and extreme learning machine models in test performance. Given the demonstrated efficacy of LSTM neural networks in electric forecasting, this research will employ the LSTM model to predict building electricity demand. In conclusion, given the limited DR peaking effect observed when implementing DLC solely in individual farm buildings, it becomes imperative to extend its application to rural building complex. This expansion aims to maximize the exploitation and utilization of the DR potential inherent in rural building complex AC systems. Meanwhile, because of the large differences in load characteristics, building forms, and system configurations between urban and rural building complex, the optimal energy scheduling methods for urban buildings cannot be directly applied to rural buildings. For rural building complex, it is necessary to take into account local energy supply, AC system forms and energy usage habits to develop a optimal energy scheduling strategy to achieve the best energy efficiency and economy. In light of this objective, this study presents a novel DR optimal scheduling control strategy for rural building complex AC systems, based on DLC and considering the individual characteristics of rural building energy. Compared with previous studies, the key practical contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows: ● A DLC-based optimal scheduling strategy is proposed for DR of AC systems in rural building complex. The optimization problem is solved using GA to achieve the peak regulation (PR) objective and maximize the load aggregator revenue. ● DLC strategies are categorized into four types, based on the degree of load shedding. At the same time, by differentiating the compensation prices of the four DLC strategies, AC users are motivated to participate in DR. ● A periodic rotation control mechanism is utilized to ensure that a larger number of AC users experience short-term and balanced sacrifice in terms of thermal comfort. ● LSTM neural network is used to accurately predict the rural power load profile and determine the PR demand in advance. The non-fixed PR demand improves the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed strategy for various rural power grids. The remaining sections of this paper are structured as follows: Section 2 presents an overview of constructing a DR optimization model based on DLC for an AC system in a rural building complex. Section 3 describes a typical soil source heat pump system found in rural residences, including its simulation model, and outlines the flow of the joint EnergyPlus and Python simulation. In Section 4, the test results of the proposed DR strategy are analyzed in terms of indoor temperature, peak load reduction, and revenue, in comparison to the baseline strategy. Finally, Section 5 summarizes the key findings of this study and discusses potential avenues for future research. 2 Methodology The proposed methodology for optimizing the scheduling of AC systems in rural building complex is based on DLC and consists of four key components: i) DR market model; ii) DR optimal scheduling model; iii) power load forecasting model; and iv) process design of the DLC-based optimal scheduling strategy. The DR market model establishes the fundamental framework for the overall control strategy. The DR optimal scheduling model delineates the objectives, conditions, and algorithms utilized for the optimal control strategy. The power load forecasting model is employed to anticipate the PR demand in advance, serving as a prerequisite for the optimal strategy. Lastly, building upon this foundation, a comprehensive process for implementing the DLC-based optimal scheduling strategy is proposed. 2.1 DR market model In practical scenarios, the DR effect of individual rural AC user loads is often minimal. A viable solution is to aggregate the loads of all AC users within a rural building complex to participate in DR. Hence, a DR market model is proposed for rural building complex to centralize the control of AC equipment in such clusters. Fig. 1 depicts the DR trilateral market model, encompassing the power company, load aggregator (LA), and decentralized AC loads within rural building complex. As depicted in Fig. 1, a LA, acting as a DR provider, can engage in the primary energy market or ancillary services market by effectively integrating AC loads through specialized technical methodologies. By means of the LA, the power company can effectively consolidate the scattered AC loads within rural areas. From a macro perspective, the power company can utilize historical energy usage data analysis to predict PR periods and PR volumes for the subsequent day, thus forming the PR demand. Subsequently, the power company can engage in trade with the LA, entering into contracts that specify PR demand and compensation. At a micro level, the LA establishes a contract with the customer, gaining partial control over the power consumption decisions of the customer's AC. By providing financial compensation, the LA incentivizes the customer to participate in PR initiatives. Moreover, the LA can develop a well-founded DLC strategy based on the PR period and PR volume communicated by the power company. This strategy allows for centralized equipment control for contracted customers, ensuring maximum profitability while fulfilling the PR demand. Given the substantial number of AC users residing in rural building complex, their electricity consumption and comfort preferences exhibit variations. Consequently, a classification system is employed to categorize these users based on their individual electricity usage behavior and demand. Distinct DR control strategies are then implemented for each category of AC users. Simultaneously, a differentiated compensation mechanism is utilized to incentivize rural customers to actively engage in the DR program orchestrated by the LA. The compensation price for DR participation is contingent upon the extent of reduction achieved in AC electricity consumption, thereby ensuring a proportional correlation between the two. 2.2 DR optimal scheduling model 2.2.1 Objective function Suppose the LA has categorized AC users into k distinct groups based on their power consumption behavior and demand. For each category, the LA has implemented DLC as a means of regulation. It is assumed that the number of controlled users aligns with the number of ACs under the LA's agreement. Specifically, this implies that each household possesses a single AC mainframe, and all ACs share identical specifications and models. Let M represent the total number of ACs, and m k denote the number of ACs in category k . Additionally, let P k n ( i ) denote the power consumption of the n th AC in category k during time period i , and s k n ( i ) indicate its corresponding state. Here, s k n ( i ) = 0 represents the AC being off, while s k n ( i ) = 1 indicates that it is turned on. Consequently, Eq. (1) displays the total power consumption for each type of AC during time period i when DLC is not implemented. (1) ∅ k ( i ) = ∑ n k = 1 m k P k n ( i ) × s k n ( i ) where: P k n ( i ) represents the power consumption of the n th AC in category k during time period i in the absence of DLC, and ∅ k ( i ) denotes the aggregate power consumption of each group of ACs during time period i without the implementation of DLC. Eq. (2) illustrates the total power consumption for each type of AC during time period i when DLC is implemented. (2) ∅ k \u2032 ( i ) = ∑ n k = 1 m k P k n \u2032 ( i ) × s k n ( i ) where: P k n \u2032 ( i ) represents the power consumption of the n th AC in category k during time period i while implementing DLC, and ∅ k \u2032 ( i ) denotes the aggregate power consumption of each group of ACs during time period i while implementing DLC. Therefore, based on Eq. (1) and Eq. (2), the power reduction Δ P k ( i ) for each category of AC equipment within each AC group following the implementation of control during time period i can be calculated. It is illustrated in Eq. (3), where the power reduction for similar individual ACs remains consistent. (3) Δ P k ( i ) = ∅ k ( i ) − ∅ k \u2032 ( i ) x k ( i ) where: x k ( i ) represents the quantity of ACs engaged in DLC within each specific type of AC group during time period i . The model employs a distinct compensation mechanism, which considers the extent of load reduction in order to provide compensation to all categories of AC users. Specifically, the compensation amount increases as the reduction in load increases. Assuming the lowest compensation price for the user with the smallest AC load reduction, the lowest compensation price is set to 0.1 yuan/kWh with reference to the Shaanxi Province time-of-use tariff. To incentivize active participation in peak regulation, the compensation price for other categories is determined based on the magnitude of the reduction. The price is directly proportional to the corresponding reduction and varies over time. Hence, the compensation price c k ( i ) for each category of AC users during time period i can be mathematically expressed as Eq. (4). (4) c k ( i ) = { 0.1 ， k = 1 Δ P k = 2 ( i ) Δ P k = 1 ( i ) × 0.1 ， k = 2 Δ P k = 3 ( i ) Δ P k = 1 ( i ) × 0.1 ， k = 3 ⋯ Δ P k = n ( i ) Δ P k = 1 ( i ) × 0.1 ， k = n The primary objective of optimal scheduling in this paper is to maximize the benefits of the LA while meeting PR demand. Ignoring the transactions between LA and power company, this objective is equivalent to minimize the compensation costs paid by the LA. It is assumed that the total compensation cost incurred by the LA during time period i is denoted as B ( i ) , and the number of ACs engaged in DLC for each type of AC group during time period i is represented as x k ( i ) . Therefore, the objective function can be expressed as Eq. (5). (5) min B ( i ) = ∑ k = 1 k c k ( i ) × x k ( i ) 2.2.2 Constraint conditions (1) PR demand constraint The assumption is made that the scheduling center obtains the PR period, denoted as ( D i ∼ D i + 1 ) , through power load forecasting. Here, i represents different PR periods with a unit interval of 1 h. The PR target volume, denoted as L i , is assumed to be half of the forecasted peak value L h minus the forecasted trough value L l during this PR period i . Consequently, the PR demand can be mathematically expressed as Eq. (6). (6) { d i ∈ ( D i ∼ D i + 1 ) l i ≥ L i = ( L h − L l ) / 2 where: d i represents the effective control period of DLC, which must align with the PR period requirement. Similarly, l i denotes the actual load reduction achieved through DLC during period i, and it must meet or exceed the PR target volume. To guarantee the achievement of the PR target volume during the designated PR period, while maximizing the LA's profit, it is imperative that the actual load reduction, denoted as l i , in time period i complies with the specific constraint of Δ P k ( i ) for each individual AC load reduction type. This requirement is outlined in Eq. (7). (7) l i = ∑ k = 1 k Δ P k ( i ) × x k ( i ) ≥ L i (2) Number of users constraint There is an additional constraint on the quantity of users, denoted as x k ( i ) , who engage in DLC within each category of AC clusters during the designated PR period i. This constraint can be mathematically represented as Eq. (8). (8) { 0 ≤ x k ( i ) ≤ m k ∑ k = 1 k x k ( i ) ≤ M where: m k represents the user count for each category of AC units, and M denotes the total number of AC users. (3) Indoor thermal comfort constraint To ensure a minimum level of thermal comfort for rural residents, an inclusion of a temperature constraint is incorporated into this model. When the indoor temperature does not satisfy the constraint, the DLC will be stopped until the constraint is satisfied. The temperature constraint can be represented as Eq. (9). (9) T min ( i ) ≤ T k n ( i ) ≤ T max ( i ) where: T k n ( i ) represents the indoor temperature of the n th individual utilizing an AC unit within class k during time period i . T min ( i ) and T max ( i ) denote the lower and upper threshold temperature. 2.2.3 Optimization algorithms Optimization algorithms are typically categorized into two primary groups based on whether they rely on gradient computation [41]. Gradient-based optimization methods encompass classical approaches such as LP, multi-objective LP, fuzzy LP, dynamic programming, and fuzzy dynamic programming [42,43]. These methods employ derivatives of objective and constraint functions to facilitate the search for optimal solutions. Conversely, gradient-free direct methods fall under the umbrella of intelligent optimization algorithms and include techniques like GA, ant colony algorithms, and particle swarm algorithms [44,45]. Generally, gradient-free direct algorithms excel at tackling complex, high-dimensional nonlinear problems, making them more versatile in their applications [41]. In this study, both LP and GA, two typical algorithms, are employed to solve the optimal scheduling problem for PR of rural AC systems. By comparing the solution performance of both algorithms, the more applicable algorithm will be selected. (1) LP Derived from the field of Operations Research, LP is a mathematical technique employed to facilitate scientific management. The fundamental process of LP for resolving optimization problems is depicted in Fig. 2 . The objective function and constraints are expounded upon in Sections 2.2.1 and 2.2.2, respectively. The decision variables pertain to the number of users engaging in DR programs within each category of AC clusters during the PR period, and these variables are constrained to integer values. Consequently, Integer Linear Programming (ILP) is employed to address the model, treating the decision variables as integers. Furthermore, the LP model is dynamically linked to both the power load forecaster and the compensation price calculator. The power load forecaster and the compensation price calculator generate outputs encompassing the PR periods, PR volumes, and compensation prices for each customer category, which are subsequently transmitted to the LP model. Drawing upon these variables, the algorithmic model optimizes and computes the optimal decision variables along with the minimized objective function values. (2) GA The GA is a computational model that operates based on the principles of natural selection and genetics. By simulating fundamental genetic operations like crossover, mutation, and selection in an evolutionary process, the algorithm achieves solutions to optimization problems. Fig. 3 illustrates the basic process of a GA. The search process commences with a population of randomly generated initial solutions, referred to as individuals. Each individual represents a solution to the problem and is known as a chromosome. These chromosomes undergo evolution in subsequent iterations, known as generations. The GA primarily achieve solutions through selection, crossover, and mutation operations. Crossover and mutation operations produce the next generation of chromosomes, known as progeny. The quality of a chromosome is determined by its fitness, and a certain number of individuals are selected from the previous generation and the offspring based on their fitness to form the subsequent generation. This process continues iteratively. After several generations, the algorithm converges on the best chromosome, representing the optimal solution to the problem. The objective function, constraints and decision variables of the GA are consistent with the ILP. 2.3 Electricity load forecasting model In this paper, LSTM neural networks are employed within artificial neural networks for the purpose of power load forecasting. The forecasted outcomes are then integrated into a DR optimization model, which subsequently directs the formulation of DR optimization scheduling strategies for AC systems in rural building complex. 2.3.1 LSTM neural network prediction model The LSTM neural network, an enhanced iteration of the recurrent neural network, incorporates input gates, output gates, and forgetting gates within the hidden layer, alongside an additional information stream that represents long-term memory. These enhancements empower the network with robust long and short-term memory capabilities for accurate prediction of nonlinear time-series data and demonstrate exceptional performance in short-term load prediction. The neuronal architecture of the LSTM neural network is depicted in Fig. 4 . As illustrated, it establishes connections not only between the output and input layers but also between the current cell state and the previous state within the hidden layer. The hidden layer encompasses three distinct multiplicative units: the input gate, the output gate, and the forgetting gate. The roles of these three gates are as follows: ● Input gate: Selectively assimilating advantageous information from the input data and the latent state of the preceding time step. ● Output gate: Constructs the present latent state. ● Forget gate: Variables that ascertain whether to erase or transmit the state of the preceding cell. To enhance the nonlinearity of the neural network model, thereby improving its capacity to comprehend and process intricate data, all three gates employ sigmoid activation functions, which confine the output within the range of 0\u20131. The sigmoid function can be mathematically defined as: σ ( x ) = 1 1 + e − x . In Fig. 4, X = [ x 1 , x 2 , x 3 \u2026 x t ] is the state signal value entered by the input gate. H = [ h 1 , h 2 , h 3 \u2026 h t ] is the final value of the output and C = [ c 1 , c 2 , c 3 \u2026 c t ] is the state information value in the LSTM neuron structure. The three gates are represented as follows: i t , f t and o t are on behalf of input gate, forget gate, and output gate, respectively. c ˜ t is intermediate value during the calculation. Forget gate: (10) f t = σ ( W f ∙ [ c t − 1 , h t − 1 , x t ] + b f ) Input gate: (11) i t = σ ( W i ∙ [ c t − 1 , h t − 1 , x t ] + b i ) (12) c ˜ t = tan h ( W c ∙ [ h t − 1 , x t ] + b c ) (13) c t = f t ∙ c t − 1 + i t ∙ c ˜ t Output gate: (14) o t = σ ( W o ∙ [ c t , h t − 1 , x t ] + b o ) (15) h t = o t ∙ tan h ( c t ) where: W f , W i , W c and W o are weight matrices. b f , b i , b c and b o are bias vectors. h t and h t − 1 are the outputs at the current time t and the previous time t-1, respectively. The hyperbolic tangent function can be expressed: tan h x = e x − e − x e x + e − x . 2.3.2 Prediction process design The methodology for constructing the LSTM prediction model involved designing the flow of rural building complex electric load prediction, as illustrated in Fig. 5 . Initially, a dataset comprising 10 years of total electric load data from the village area simulation model was selected, with a data interval of 1 h, to serve as input for the prediction model. Prior to importing the data into the model, it was essential to conduct data cleaning to address any missing or abnormal data. Furthermore, data normalization played a crucial role in the data processing phase. Generally, employing data normalization techniques can expedite algorithm convergence and enhance the training accuracy of the model. In the LSTM model adopted here, failure to normalize the data would result in the weights being disproportionately influenced by the range of feature variables, which is not desirable. Eq. (16) illustrates the computation of data normalization, where x n ew represents the normalized data, x denotes the original data, Min A represents the minimum value of x , and Max A represents the maximum value of x . Following the normalization process, all data points are mapped to the interval [0,1]. (16) x new = x − Min A Max A − Min A Based on this approach, the initial 7-year segment of data from the 10-year dataset is allocated as the training set, while the remaining 3-year segment is assigned as the test set. Subsequently, the structure and parameters of the prediction model are determined. The model's network architecture comprises five layers, which are classified as follows: one input layer, one output layer, and three intermediate layers, as indicated in Table 1 . The parameters listed in the table correspond to the number of neural network nodes present in each layer. Additionally, the parameters of the discard layer signify the data loss rate, reinforcing the model's generalization ability by deliberately omitting a portion of the data, thereby mitigating the occurrence of overfitting. Once the neural network's structure and parameters are established, the backpropagation technique is employed to train the prediction model, aiming to minimize the loss function. Backpropagation is a widely utilized optimization algorithm for training neural networks. It relies on the gradient descent algorithm, which updates the model parameters by calculating the partial derivatives of each parameter with respect to the loss function. Additionally, the LSTM backpropagation process incorporates the use of the Adam optimizer, which accelerates training and enhances the model's performance. The Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation) algorithm is a self-adjusting network optimization method that dynamically adjusts the learning rate of parameters, leveraging the momentum gradient algorithm. This optimization algorithm boasts a simple structure, rapid computation speed, and stable optimization results. The parameters employed for the Adam optimizer in this study are outlined in Table 1. The historical 80-h building load data { Q t N − 79 , Q t N − 78 , \u2026 , Q t N − 1 , Q t N } are used as inputs to the LSTM model, and the load Q t N + 1 for the next hour is predicted to be obtained as the output of the model. The predicted load data for the next hour is then fed into the algorithm as an input variable to predict the load for the next 2 h. In this rolling iterative manner, the load for the next 24 h can be predicted. 2.3.3 Evaluation indices In this study, the evaluation of errors is conducted based on the computation of the root mean square error (RMSE, Eq. (17)) and the mean absolute error (MAE, Eq. (18)). Additionally, the R 2 coefficient (Eq. (19)) is determined for further analysis. When assessing the model, smaller values of RMSE and MAE indicate a reduced disparity between the predicted and actual values, thereby reflecting improved prediction outcomes. Moreover, the R 2 coefficient ranges from 0 to 1, where values closer to 1 signify greater explanatory power of the equation's variables for y and a better fit of the model to the data. (17) R M S E = 1 N ∑ i = 1 N ( y i − y ˆ i ) 2 (18) M A E = 1 N ∑ i = 1 N | ( y i − y ˆ i ) | (19) R 2 = 1 − ∑ i = 1 N y i − y ˆ i 2 ∑ i = 1 N y i − y \u203e i 2 where: N represents the total number of prediction experiments. y i is the true value, y ˆ i is the predicted value, and y \u203e i represents the mean. 2.4 Flow design of DLC-based optimal scheduling model Once the power company transmits the PR demand to the LA, the LA must devise a sound strategy for DR control of each AC unit in the community, ensuring compliance with the PR demand and maintaining customer thermal comfort. For the proposed strategy, the DR control of the ACs is realized by means of DLC, which includes both types of DCCM and TSCM. 2.4.1 DCCM and TSCM strategies Direct compressor control mechanism (DCCM) is a strategy aimed at achieving electricity load reduction by directly shutting down the mainframe of AC units during the DR period. The operational process of DCCM is illustrated in Fig. 6 . During each time step, the actuator of the AC host determines whether to implement DCCM based on the LA's scheduling of individual customer ACs. If not, the actuator remains in its initial state. If yes, the actuator then evaluates whether the current room temperature satisfies the temperature constraint function. The temperature constraint judgment function is defined by Eq. (20), which ensures the minimum comfort temperature is maintained during the power reduction period. Here, T s ( i ) represents the average indoor temperature during PR period i , while T min ( i ) and T max ( i ) represent the minimum and maximum constraint temperatures set by the model, respectively. According to the relevant building environment design standards [46,47], and considering the special living habits and clothing level of rural residents [48], the minimum and maximum constraint temperature for DCCM are eventually set at 14 °C and 30 °C, respectively. If the room temperature satisfies the constraint condition, the actuator will turn off the AC. Otherwise, the actuator remains in its initial state until the end of the time step. (20) T min ( i ) ≤ T s ( i ) ≤ T max ( i ) Thermostat set-point control mechanism (TSCM) is a strategy employed to adjust the setpoint of room temperature during DR. The operational process of TSCM is illustrated in Fig. 7 . Similar to the DCCM strategy, during each time step, the AC thermostat initially determines whether to implement TSCM and calculates the amount of set temperature change, which is still contingent upon the LA's schedule. The magnitude of temperature change in TSCM is associated with the level of DR, as depicted in Table 2 . A higher DR level corresponds to a larger power reduction amount and consequently, a greater adjustment in the room temperature setpoint. Subsequently, if TSCM requires execution, further assessments are made based on room temperature constraints. The definition and functionality of the temperature constraint judgment function remain the same as those in DCCM. Finally, if there is no need to implement TSCM or if the room temperature surpasses the constraints, the room temperature setpoint is restored to its original value. Otherwise, the room temperature setpoint is adjusted according to the schedule until the end of the time step. 2.4.2 Flow design of the optimal scheduling strategy The PR market model, PR optimal scheduling model, power load forecasting model and DLC strategy, which are the basic elements for developing the DLC optimization strategy for HVAC in rural building complex, were introduced earlier in this section. Based on these elements, the implementation flow of the complete DLC-based DR optimization scheduling strategy for HVAC in rural building complex is proposed as shown in Fig. 8 . As depicted in Fig. 8, with the LA assuming centralized control over the AC equipment participating in the PR market, DLC-based optimal scheduling strategy encompasses the following four primary steps: 1) Determine PR demand The power company dispatcher provides input parameters, including historical electricity consumption data, date, and weather data, to the power load forecasting model. The dispatcher requests the output of forecasted PR periods and PR volumes for the following day. This information is utilized to determine the PR demand, including PR periods and PR volumes, which is then fed into the LA. 2) Conclusion of a centralized control contract The LA engages in a centralized control agreement with the AC customer and tailors the customer's classification based on the heat demand of each individual. Simultaneously, the aggregator devises a distinct compensation mechanism for DR based on the extent of load reduction in electricity consumption. 3) Determine the optimal variables and target values Calculate the average load regulation for each customer category and obtain the compensation price using the compensation price calculator. Next, input the PR period, PR volume, average load regulation, and compensation price for each customer category into the DR optimal scheduling model. Utilize an optimization algorithm to obtain the optimal solution and target value. 4) Generate the optimal control strategy The optimal solution and target values are fed into the AC demand control model. This model generates the optimal control strategy and regulates the AC using the actuator to execute the corresponding DLC control. 2.4.3 Periodic rotation control mechanism To allow as many AC users as possible in the contract to share the indoor thermal comfort sacrifices made by DR and to reduce the duration of thermal discomfort, a periodic rotation control mechanism is implemented, which schedules batches of ACs based on a predetermined ratio of cycles. And the batch-controlled cycle step should be shorter than the cycle step of the overall optimization model. Table 3 illustrates the underlying principles of periodic rotation control. Assuming a PR period of 14:00\u201315:00 and a control cycle of 15 min for ACs, there are a total of four control cycles. It is assumed that after optimization calculation, the number of ACs requiring real-time control in class A users during the DR period is represented by n , while the total number of class A ACs is denoted as N . Consequently, Table 3 presents the periodic control of class A ACs during the PR time period, divided into two scenarios based on the relative size of n and N / 4 . The vertical axis of the table signifies the PR time period, while the horizontal axis represents the AC serial number for class A users. A value of 1 indicates control by DLC, whereas 0 indicates no control by DLC. 3 Test setup The AC system simulation model for rural building complexe in this paper is constructed as a prototype of an actual single farmhouse. The effectiveness of the simulation model for the single farmhouse is experimentally confirmed. This section presents the rural building complex AC system simulation model, along with the co-simulation model of the AC system and python optimization algorithms. 3.1 Air-conditioning system of experimental platform The experimental platform selected for this study is a representative farmhouse situated in Xianyang City, Shaanxi Province. This farmhouse, spanning an area of 145.12 m2, is oriented towards the south and north and possesses the following dimensions: 12.98 m × 11.18 m × 4.00 m (length × width × height). It is a single-story structure comprising seven rooms, as illustrated in Fig. 9 : four bedrooms, a kitchen, a bathroom, and a living room designed to serve as a dining area. The AC system for this experimental platform utilizes two soil source heat pump units as its cooling and heating source. Fig. 10 illustrates the components of a soil source heat pump system. Each heat pump unit operates in a variable frequency mode and provides heat to two fan coils. Due to differences in building envelope, indoor thermal environment requirement, and energy consumption between rural and urban buildings, the \"all day, all space\" type of urban heating mode is not suitable for rural buildings. Instead, a flexible \"part time, part space\" heating mode is employed for rural buildings. Consequently, the heat pump AC area only includes bedroom A and B, the living room, and dining room, with a total AC area of 96.2 m2. The design temperature for winter heating is 16 °C, and the heating time is limited to 08:00\u201321:00. The primary instruments and equipment utilized for this test are depicted in Fig. 11 . Specifically, the room temperature and humidity were recorded by positioning a HOBO MX1101 wireless temperature and humidity logger at the center of the room with a sampling interval of 1 min. Additionally, an electric power meter was employed to monitor the sub-electricity consumption of both the heat pump AC unit and other electricity-consuming equipment within the farmhouse. 3.2 Air-conditioning system simulation model in EnergyPlus 3.2.1 Single farmhouse To examine and validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy from a wider perspective, a comprehensive and detailed EnergyPlus simulation model for the single farmhouse is constructed based on the experimental platform. The simulation model utilizes a comprehensive physical model that encompasses the building envelope and key components of the AC system, including heat pumps, pumps, transmission and distribution piping, fans, and end coils. Notably, the AC system comprises two identical heat pumps with a rated heat production capacity of 5400 W, two inverter pumps with a rated power of 300 W, and four fan coils. The simulation encompasses the dynamic processes of heat transfer, hydraulic characteristics, and DR control of the entire system. Moreover, the lighting is configured at 10 W/m2, while the electronic equipment operates at 12 W/m2, as per the specific requirements. Additional simulation parameters, such as the building envelope, AC equipment, and occupancy patterns, are set based on the prototype of the experimental platform. The accuracy and reliability of the simulation model is verified in terms of energy consumption and indoor temperature, respectively. Fig. 12 shows the hourly electricity consumption of a single farmhouse during a typical heating day on February 28th. As shown in the figure, the relative error between the simulated and actual electricity consumption has a mean value of 4.3 % and a maximum value of 7.3 %, both of which are less than 10 %, so the relative error can be considered to be within a reasonable range. Meanwhile, Fig. 13 shows a comparison of the simulated and actual room temperatures for Bedroom A on February 28th. As shown, the simulated room temperature trend is generally consistent with the actual room temperature trend, and the mean absolute error is 0.3 °C, which is considered to be within a normal range [49]. 3.2.2 Rural building complex While the experimental verification of the DR performance of a single farmhouse implementing the DLC optimization strategy is feasible, the focus of this study is not limited to a single farmhouse but extends to a rural building complex. The simulation model for the AC system of the rural building complex will be constructed based on the single farmhouse model. In real-world scenarios, the form, size, layout, and envelope of each individual farmhouse building within the village may vary. Meanwhile, considering the computer simulation efficiency and solution performance, the simulation parameters of the rural building complex are reasonably simplified with reference to the village where the experimental platform is located, as follows: 1) Based on the number of permanent households in the village, a total of 200 rural residential buildings were established. It is assumed that each building has dimensions of 10.00 m × 10.00 m × 4.00 m (length × width × height) and is distributed in a grid of 10 rows × 20 columns. The total constructed area amounts to 20,000 m2. It is further assumed that all buildings have a uniform architectural design. 2) The simulation model is established based on the actual distribution of building orientations in the village, with an equal ratio of buildings facing south and north, at a 1:1 proportion. 3) It is assumed that each farmhouse has a standardized building envelope, which consists of a wooden exterior door measuring 1.75 m × 2.75 m. Additionally, there are three exterior windows, each measuring 1.75 m × 2.00 m, featuring 6+6A + 6 aluminum single-frame hollow windows. The interior of each building is designed as a spacious, open area without any internal walls. Furthermore, all building envelope materials and thermal performance parameters align with the specifications of the aforementioned single farmhouse experimental platform. 4) The indoor personnel settings and work-rest arrangements of each rural building are derived from the parameters of the experimental platform. Furthermore, the stepped settings of lighting and electricity equipment schedules are designed with consideration for actual power high and low peaks. Fig. 14 showcases both the layout of the original rural building complex and the simplified 3D model of the village. After the building simulation model is completed, the AC system models of each rural building in the village need to be further constructed in EnergyPlus in order to constitute a complete simulation model of the energy consumption of the rural building complex. Equip each rural building with the same soil source heat pump air-conditioning system as the experimental platform with the following modeling details: 1) Each household in the village was equipped with heat pump AC, and the thermal zone for AC in each household was simplified to a uniform connected area. This simplification does not compromise the analysis of overall AC energy consumption and thermal comfort for individual households. Additionally, the number, materials, and performance parameters of heat pump unit, fan coil, pumps, vertical heat exchanger, and other elements within the AC system remain consistent with the model for experimental platform. 2) The air loop and outdoor water loop within each household's heat pump system are constructed based on the model of the prototype farmhouse. Furthermore, the configuration of the electricity price model remains unchanged. 3) Taking into account the variation in energy requirements and thermal comfort among rural residents in real villages, the rural household users are categorized into five groups based on the designated indoor temperature settings outlined in Table 4 . Each group consists of a total of 40 users. The designations a-e correspond to five levels of energy consumption, namely low, medium-low, medium, medium-high, and high respectively. 4) Taking into account the varying user adaptability to DLC strategies with different degrees of load reduction in the actual DR project, the four types of DR strategies, namely DCCM, TSCM-Ⅰ, TSCM-Ⅱ, TSCM-Ⅲ, are evenly allocated to users belonging to five energy consumption groups. The serial numbers of users corresponding to each class and group of controlled ACs are shown in Table 5 . 3.3 Co-simulation model of python and EnergyPlus The detailed implementation diagram of the EnergyPlus-Python co-simulation platform is shown in Fig. 15 . The HVAC module for the rural building complex was developed in EnergyPlus, while the control module for the optimization algorithm was implemented in Python. The building HVAC module utilizes the eppy library to establish an external interface. Prior to the initiation of DR, the electric load forecaster accesses historical electric load data from the EnergyPlus simulation model through the eppy library. This data is then utilized by the LSTM forecasting model to generate accurate peak demand forecasts, which serve as the objective function for the DR peaking model. During the DR period, the EnergyPlus model with the eppy interface is simulated in a single step. The results of this simulation are subsequently fed into the optimization algorithm to determine the new objective function and constraints, thereby obtaining an optimal control strategy. Concurrently, the compensation price calculator computes the DR compensation price for each user type based on the load reduction achieved through the implementation of the optimal control strategy. This compensation price is then utilized as a calculation parameter within the optimization algorithm. Ultimately, the optimal control strategy is outputted as the number of DR users for each type, which is used to reset the strategy in the eppy model. By utilizing the eppy interface, the EnergyPlus model incorporates the new policy for subsequent iterations of the simulation. This entire process is iterated in 1-min time steps until the conclusion of the DR plan. 4 Results and discussions The test took place on January 10, which was a typical day with heating requirements. Initially, the LSTM model was employed to forecast the power load curve of that day in order to determine the PR period and PR volume. Next, the LA incorporated the information of the PR period and PR volume into the DR optimization model to find the most favorable strategy. The DR optimization problem was tackled using both the ILP and GA algorithms, and the algorithm exhibiting superior performance was chosen. Ultimately, the outcomes of the proposed optimization strategy were evaluated and discussed in relation to the baseline strategy, focusing on indoor temperature, load regulation, and revenue. 4.1 LSTM peak load prediction By incorporating the pre-trained parameters of the LSTM model into Eq. (17)\u2013(19), it was ascertained that RMSE amounts to 34.535, MAE stands at 19.134, and R 2 reaches 0.939. These findings serve as validation for the prediction model's remarkable precision and lend credibility to the notion of utilizing the prediction results to inform subsequent testing. Employing the sophisticated LSTM neural network algorithm, it becomes feasible to proactively anticipate the hourly average electricity load curve of the model village on January 10, as exemplified in Fig. 16 . With a marginal relative error of just 7 % between the projected load and the actual load, the model is deemed to yield satisfactory outcomes, positioning the error well within the realms of normalcy. Upon scrutinizing the anticipated load curve, it becomes evident that the day in question encompasses two distinct peak periods and one peak-valley period. The initial peak materializes as the morning peak, transpiring 09:00\u201310:00, showcasing a forecasted average peak of approximately 517.00 kW. The subsequent peak spans 17:00\u201318:00, showcasing a forecasted average peak of about 465.00 kW. As for the peak-valley period, it occurs during 13:00\u201314:00, featuring a projected average load of roughly 411.00 kW. Thus, in accordance with Eq. (6), the PR periods of 09:00\u201310:00 and 17:00\u201318:00 correspond to PR targets of 53.00 kW and 27.00 kW, respectively. 4.2 Comparison of ILP and GA optimization algorithms The DR optimization problem is addressed using the ILP and GA algorithms, and the optimal solutions and objective function values are depicted in Table 6 . Under identical objective function and constraints, the ILP and GA algorithms yield different levels of participation from various user types in the DR process, while maintaining almost identical minimum total compensation costs. This suggests that both algorithms effectively resolve the problem explored in this study. However, GA exhibits a solution speed approximately 30 % faster than ILP, thereby demonstrating higher practical applicability. Consequently, after comprehensive deliberation, the GA algorithm is selected as the algorithm employed for the PR model solution. The subsequent Section 4.3 presents the test results obtained using the GA algorithm as the solver. 4.3 DR test results on rural building complex 4.3.1 Load reduction Fig. 17 depicts the electricity load curves for HVAC and total building in the village complex under the proposed DR strategy as well as the baseline (BL) strategy, which refers to a normal usage pattern of an HVAC system without DR events. Under the BL strategy, both the total building load and HVAC load exhibit fluctuations throughout the day, influenced by lighting, electrical equipment schedules, and external conditions. At 08:00, both loads experience a sharp increase followed by a rapid decline. This temporary surge in load can be attributed to the thermal inertia of the HVAC system (including water system and indoor air system) when the AC is activated, aligning with real-world scenarios. The PR periods of the day, as evidenced by the total building baseline load curve, occur from 09:00 to 10:00 and 17:00 to 18:00, affirming the accuracy of the hourly average electricity load forecasting results outlined in Section 4.1. Furthermore, the peak periods of the HVAC baseline load substantially align with those of the total building baseline load, further underscoring the HVAC load as a key contributing factor to the peak electricity load in the village building complex. During non-DR periods, the load trends of both types under the proposed DR strategy closely resemble those observed under the BL strategy. However, during DR periods, both loads experience varying degrees of reduction and frequent fluctuations, with detailed changes illustrated in However, during DR periods, both loads experience varying degrees of reduction and frequent fluctuations, with detailed changes illustrated in Fig. 18 . As depicted in Fig. 18(a) and (b), under the influence of DLC, the overall HVAC load remains below the baseline load and exhibits frequent fluctuations during the two DR periods. In the PR period from 09:00 to 10:00, the proposed DR strategy effectively achieves an average load regulation of 55.37 kW, surpassing the regulation target of 53.00 kW by 4.5 %. Similarly, during the PR period from 17:00 to 18:00, the average load regulation reaches 29.39 kW, exceeding the regulation target of 27.00 kW by 8.8 %. It can be concluded that the air-conditioning load regulation in rural building complex is much smaller than in urban public buildings, e.g., an urban building air-conditioning system could achieve a power reduction about 1200 kW during the DR period [16]. This is due to the large size and density of urban building complexes, which have much greater baseline loads than rural complexes. Even so, with small rural baseline loads and an average peak shaving rate of nearly 10 %, it is still significant in reducing pressure on the rural grid. Furthermore, there is a notable occurrence of load rebound effect [50], with a sudden increase followed by a decrease in HVAC load towards the end of each PR period. It is important to highlight that the number of HVAC load oscillations in the afternoon is significantly lower compared to the morning. This discrepancy can be attributed to a higher acceptance of the more stable TSCM control in the afternoon, while fewer users opt for DCCM control. As a result, the HVAC load in the afternoon experiences significant fluctuations only at the 15-min rotating control node. 4.3.2 Indoor temperature Four selected representative users, identified by serial numbers 1(A,a), 61(B,b), 121(C,c), and 181(D,d), were analyzed to examine their indoor temperature patterns under both the baseline strategy and the proposed DR optimization strategy, as illustrated in Fig. 19 . In Fig. 19, the indoor temperature curves of the four users exhibit significant overlap under the two strategies during the non-DR period. However, during the designated DR time period, the indoor temperature of all four users shows varying degrees of reduction compared to the baseline temperature. Notably, User 1, classified as a class A user, is characterized as a low-energy user with a heating temperature set point of 16 °C. Following the periodic rotation control mechanism, User 1's AC undergoes DLC control in the DCCM type during 09:00\u201309:15, 09:30\u201309:45, 09:45\u201310:00, and 17:00\u201317:15. Throughout these four periods, the indoor temperature of User 1 consistently fluctuates above 14 °C, ensuring a fundamental level of thermal comfort. During the DR period, user 61, 121, and 181 all receive DLC control of the TSCM type. Specifically, user 61 is assigned TSCM-Ⅰ during 09:15\u201309:30, 17:00\u201317:15, and 17:30\u201317:45, resulting in an approximate 1 °C decrease in indoor temperature. User 121, on the other hand, experiences TSCM-Ⅱ control from 09:30\u201309:45, 17:15\u201317:30, and 17:45\u201318:00, leading to a similar 1 °C decrease in indoor temperature. Lastly, user 181 receives TSCM-Ⅲ control during 09:15\u201309:30 and 17:45\u201318:00, also resulting in a 1 °C decrease in indoor temperature. Apart from variations in baseline temperatures attributed to differences in energy usage levels, the indoor temperature trends of user 61, 121, and 181 are essentially identical. It is worth highlighting the notably smoother indoor temperatures of user 61, 121, and 181 during their DR period in comparison to user 1. This observation provides empirical evidence for the enhanced stability of TSCM control type over DCCM. In summary, the proposed DR strategy effectively achieves the PR target while ensuring that users from various categories make reasonable sacrifices in terms of thermal comfort during the DR period. 4.3.3 Revenues Fig. 20 illustrates the total load regulation of different user types and the average load regulation of individual users. As depicted in Fig. 20(a), the total load regulation for each user type follows the order: A > D > C > B. Notably, user type A accounts for a significant share of 61.4 %, surpassing the regulation of other user types. Additionally, the number of participating DR users varies across different DR periods, as indicated by the optimal results obtained from the algorithm solution. Furthermore, Fig. 20(b) demonstrates the ranking of average load reduction for individual users: A > D > C > B. This provides evidence of the load regulation capabilities of the four DLC methods, with the order being DCCM > TSCM-III > TSCM-II > TSCM-I. The compensation price for each user type fluctuates throughout the day, corresponding to changes in load regulation during different DR periods. Moreover, the compensation price during 17:00\u201318:00 is generally higher than that during 09:00\u201310:00. This disparity can be attributed to the smaller HVAC load in the afternoon compared to the morning, resulting in greater load regulation requirements under the same DLC strategy. And the variation in hourly heat load throughout the day is primarily influenced by the fluctuating outdoor temperature. The revenues generated by AC users' participation in the DR program stem from two sources: the equivalent savings in electricity consumption resulting from HVAC load regulation and the DR compensation costs provided to users by the LA. Fig. 21 depicts the revenues obtained by each user type from these two aspects. As depicted in Fig. 21(a), the revenues from power reduction and DR compensation differ for each customer type during different PR periods, while following the same pattern: A > D > C > B. The total savings in electricity costs during 09:00\u201310:00 and 17:00\u201318:00 amount to 30.36 yuan and 16.11 yuan, respectively, resulting in a total of 46.47 yuan. Furthermore, the total DR compensation revenues during these two DR periods amount to 32.1 yuan and 10.16 yuan, respectively, totaling 42.26 yuan. In Fig. 21(b), the overall revenue amounts to 88.73 yuan, while the average revenues for individual users in these two aspects maintain the order: A > D > C > B. In summary, the proposed DR strategy not only surpasses the PR target but also minimizes the cost of AC power operation while providing users with additional financial compensation. Users of the rural building complex will receive a total PR revenue of 88.73 yuan within a single day. 5 Conclusion and future work A scheduling strategy based on DLC is developed to optimize the scheduling of DR plans for AC systems in rural building complex. To test and validate the proposed intelligent algorithm and control strategy, a simulation platform combining EnergyPlus and Python is utilized, with a soil-source heat pump AC system serving as an example. The results demonstrate that the strategy surpasses the PR target by approximately 6.65 % during the DR period, while ensuring a minimum level of thermal comfort of all user types. Furthermore, it generates a PR revenue of 88.73 yuan for the users in a single day. And the optimal scheduling scheme obtained through solving ILP and GA is nearly identical, but the GA exhibits a solution speed approximately 30 % faster than ILP, making it more practically valuable. Additionally, the LSTM model exhibits superior prediction capability, with the relative error between the actual load and predicted load being within 7 %. Despite offering significant economic and social benefits, the optimal control and scheduling of DR for DLC-based AC systems in rural building complex pose complex challenges and limitations that warrant further investigation in future research. Generally, the DLC levels for different users to participate in DR vary across different villages due to factors such as meteorological parameters, building envelope structure, energy consumption patterns, individual thermal comfort preferences, and other internal and external factors. Consequently, the optimal parameters of the scheduling models need to be adjusted accordingly. Future work should focus on enhancing the algorithm's portability when implementing the developed optimization algorithm in diverse village grids. Thus, there is a need for further research on the distribution characteristics of the response levels among rural residential groups participating in DR. Furthermore, the DLC control strategy utilized in this study primarily focuses on downward demand response (DDR) to alleviate peak load on the grid. However, it is worth noting that there are also upward demand response (UDR) DLC strategies available. These strategies involve utilizing pre-cooling or pre-heating methods to increase AC power consumption during non-DR periods. Implementing UDR alongside DDR can enhance grid demand side response, resulting in more effective load shedding and increased revenue during DR periods. In future studies, it is recommended to incorporate UDR-type DLC strategies into the optimal scheduling of DR for rural building complex. This will further enhance energy efficiency and thermal comfort. CRediT authorship contribution statement Ying'an Wei: Writing \u2013 original draft.

        "dc:description": "The abrupt surge in electricity consumption for air-conditioning (AC) in rural areas has exacerbated the rural power supply and demand imbalance, presenting a significant challenge to the reliability and stability of power provision in rural low-voltage grids. Implementing power demand response (DR) in buildings is recognized as an effective solution to address the grid's power imbalance and reliability issues. Among various building DR strategies, direct load control (DLC) stands out as a proficient approach to rapidly curtail building AC loads. However, applying this method solely to individual rural buildings proves less effective in peak regulation (PR). To fully exploit the DR potential of AC systems in rural building complex, it is essential to scale up the application of DLC. Consequently, a DLC-based DR optimal scheduling strategy is proposed for rural building complex AC systems. This strategy aims to meet PR demand and maximize the benefits for load aggregator. It establishes four DLC methods and differential compensation mechanisms, taking into account the varying thermal comfort requirements of AC users. The DR optimization model is solved using a genetic algorithm (GA), with PR demand derived from long and short-term memory neural network predictions. To validate the proposed strategy, a simulation study is conducted on a 200-unit farmhouse AC system, utilizing a typical rural soil source heat pump system in Xi'an, Shaanxi Province. The results demonstrate that the strategy surpasses the PR target by approximately 6.65 % during the DR period, while ensuring a minimum level of thermal comfort for all user categories. Additionally, it yields a PR benefit of 88.73 yuan per day for all users, thereby promoting the adoption of clean energy in rural areas.",
