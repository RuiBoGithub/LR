Transfer from the conventional strategy to the proposed strategy is achieved via explicit replication of MP-enabled ANNs using linear and nonlinear equations. Fig. 2 Overall schematic diagram of the proposed pricing strategy considering the price-based DR of the HVAC systems: (a) data flows and (b) flowchart. Fig. 3 Schematic diagram of the online-learning approach integrated into the proposed strategy: (a) the MP-enabled ANN for retail pricing and (b) the ANN-based building model for price-based DR. Fig. 4 ANN-based model to estimate the indoor temperature for the power inputs of the HVAC unit, given the building environmental conditions. Note that NAE , NAP , and NAZ were set to 4, 7, and 1, respectively. Fig. 5 Simplified diagram of the proposed pricing strategy using online MP: (a) the data flows and (b) the inputs and output of the MP-enabled ANN. Fig. 6 Test grid for the case studies on the proposed retail pricing strategy. Fig. 7 Case study conditions: (a) total load demand in the test grid during a scheduling day, and (b)\u2013(d) 24-h profiles of historical ambient temperatures, internal heat gains, and retail prices in the initial training datasets. Fig. 8 Experimental test building for the data-driven DR of the HVAC system. Fig. 9 Online learning results: (a) e(T) and (b) e(P) for the tests of the ANN-based building model and MP-enabled ANN model, respectively. Fig. 10 Estimations of (a) e(T) and (b) e(P) for the online supervised learning tests.

Graphical abstract This paper proposes an online-learning-based strategy for a distribution system operator (DSO) to determine optimal retail prices, considering the optimal operations of heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems in commercial buildings. An artificial neural network (ANN) is trained online with building energy data and represented using an explicit set of linear and nonlinear equations. An optimization problem for price-based demand response (DR) is then formulated using the explicit ANN model and repeatedly solved, producing data on optimal HVAC load schedules for various profiles of electricity prices and building environments. Another ANN is then trained online to predict directly the optimal load schedules, which is referred to as meta-prediction (MP). By replacing the DR optimization problem with the MP-enabled ANN, optimal retail electricity pricing can be achieved using a single-level decision-making structure. Consequently, the pricing optimization problem becomes simplified, enabling easier implementation and increased scalability for HVAC systems in a large distribution grid. In case studies, the proposed single-level pricing strategy is verified to successfully reflect the game-theoretic relations between the DSO and building operators, such that they effectively achieve their own objectives via the operational flexibility of the HVAC systems, while ensuring grid voltage stability and occupants\u2019 thermal comfort.

Meanwhile, the controllability of HVAC systems has improved, mainly due to the development of variable frequency drives (VFDs) and building energy management systems (BEMSs) [2]. Therefore, various demand response (DR) programs have been studied [3,4], in which the power inputs of HVAC systems are adjusted in response to variations in electricity price. For DR programs, many researchers have modeled the thermal responses of building rooms to HVAC system operations. In several studies (e.g., [3;4]), HVAC units were modeled as point-loads, and indoor temperatures were estimated using simplified equivalent thermal parameter (ETP) models. However, it was reported in [5] that such ETP models would not be appropriate for representing the thermal dynamics of a commercial building room. In [6] and [7], HVAC systems were modeled in detail based on the dynamic characteristics of physical components, such as heat exchangers and compressors. Indoor temperature variations were also estimated using comprehensive thermal response models, considering the size of the building structure and construction materials. However, commercial building operators (CBOs) and end-users are seldom informed of the model parameters of HVAC units and building structures: e.g., refrigerant pressures, time-varying coefficients of performance, and thermal resistance and capacitance of floors and walls. This makes it difficult to implement DR programs in practice. Experimental data-driven approaches have been used to overcome this difficulty [8,9], where regression algorithms are adopted to develop the polynomial equation models. The experimental models are relatively accurate, as HVAC systems can be tested over a wide operating range. However, it is time-consuming and costly to repeat these experiments for various types and sizes of HVAC systems and commercial buildings [8]. It is also difficult to test HVAC units that are already in daily service. The aforementioned issues can be resolved using big data and machine learning. Building energy data are becoming increasingly available, mainly due to advances in internet-of-things sensing technology. With these data, artificial neural networks (ANNs) can be trained to model the characteristics of HVAC system operations and corresponding indoor temperature variations, given building environments. ANN-based models can more readily be implemented for various types and sizes of HVAC systems and buildings that are currently in daily service [10], compared to the experimental models. Data volume and variability affect the performance of ANN-based models, implying the risk that ANNs are over-fitted to limited sets of training data. Recently, online learning has been discussed as a method to mitigate this risk, gradually improving modeling performance with additional data collection. Using such HVAC system models, price-based DR strategies have been studied to minimize the electricity costs of buildings [11,12]. Furthermore, retail electricity pricing strategies have been discussed to assist distribution system operators (DSOs) in inducing HVAC load shifts and, hence, achieving cost-effective and reliable operations of distribution networks (DNs), e.g., voltage support [11] and peak load shaving [12]. To integrate both DR and pricing strategies, it is essential to characterize the responses of HVAC loads to variations in electricity prices. In [13] and [14], analytic functions were used to model the response characteristics. Price sensitivity coefficients were also presented in [15] and [16]. These methods are simple but inaccurate, as they do not reflect the optimal inter-time responses of HVAC loads. The optimal power input of an HVAC system at time t is affected by not only the electricity price at t, but also the power inputs and prices at τ ≠ t, when the indoor temperatures should be maintained within acceptable limits. Rather than the simple methods, a bi-level decision-making structure has been adopted using leader-and-followers game theory [17,18], based on the hierarchical relationship between the DSO and CBOs. Given the optimal electricity price, the optimal inter-time responses of the HVAC units are determined directly in the low-level optimization problems, which affect the optimal pricing in the upper-level problem at the same time. To solve the two-level problems simultaneously, the DSO needs to reformulate the low-level problems to the equivalent Karush\u2013Kuhn\u2013Tucker (KKT) conditions [17,18] that can be integrated as additional constraints into the upper-level problem. However, the reformulation is mathematically onerous for application to a large-scale DN including several HVAC units, due to the large number of auxiliary equations and decision variables for the complementary slackness conditions. Moreover, the DSO needs to be informed of the model parameters and operational constraints of the HVAC systems and building thermal zones, which the CBOs and end-users are either reluctant to provide or simply unaware of. Therefore, it is challenging to implement the bi-level decision-making structure in practice. This paper proposes a new strategy for optimal retail pricing considering the price-based DR of HVAC systems in an ANN-based, single-level decision-making structure, rather than in the conventional bi-level structure, as shown in Fig. 1 . The proposed strategy consists of the CBO-side optimization problems for the price-based DR and the DSO-side optimization problem for the retail pricing. Specifically, the CBO formulates the DR optimization problem using the ANN-based model of building thermal dynamics. The ANN-based model uses an explicit set of linear and nonlinear equations to describe the complete architecture of the ANN. The equation set can then be directly integrated into the DR optimization problem, enabling application of a deterministic solver and hence ensuring near-global optimality of the HVAC load schedule. This approach distinguishes this paper from previous studies (e.g., [19;20]), in which the ANN-based model was treated as a black box, requiring a heuristic solver. The CBO then solves the DR optimization problem offline for each historical dataset of retail prices and building environments. As the optimal solutions are collected, another ANN model is implemented and trained to predict directly the optimal HVAC load schedules for the day-ahead retail prices, given the forecasts of the building environments. In other words, the ANN operates as a price-and-optimal-demand curve. This process is referred to as meta-prediction (MP). As in the ANN-based model, the MP-enabled ANN can be integrated directly into the pricing optimization problem, enabling optimal retail pricing to be achieved using a single-level structure, while still reflecting the game-theoretic relations between the DSO and CBOs. Therefore, the proposed strategy can be more efficient and practical for use in actual electricity markets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to propose optimal retail pricing using the MP of the price-based DR of HVAC units, relieving the need for bi-level structures. The main contributions of this paper are summarized below: \u2022 Establishing the optimal retail-pricing strategy in a single-level structure, rather than in the conventional, bi-level structure, by developing an MP-enabled ANN model. \u2022 Representing the architectures of both the ANN-based building model and the MP-enabled ANN model with explicit sets of linear and nonlinear equations, which enable the application of a deterministic solver. \u2022 Applying the online supervised learning to both the ANN-based building model and the MP-enabled ANN model, which facilitates practical implementation of the data-driven DR and retail-pricing strategies. 2 Proposed strategy for retail pricing and DR Fig. 2 shows a schematic diagram of the proposed retail pricing strategy considering the price-based DR of the HVAC systems. Fig. 2a shows the data flows through the databases of the BEMS and distribution management system (DMS), and Fig. 2b represents the corresponding flowchart. In Fig. 2a, the arrows numbered 1\u20137 represent the data flows in the price-based DR strategy (i.e., the building-side optimization problem). For each building, the initial training of an ANN is performed using historical data on building operations (i.e., [Et , Tt , Pt ]) to develop a data-driven model of the building thermal dynamics (or equivalently to estimate Tt for Pt , given Et ). For day-ahead DR scheduling, Et needs to be forecasted; for brevity, forecasting algorithms are not discussed here. Once an ANN is selected based on the modeling accuracy and overfitting index, it is then replicated using an explicit set of equations with parameter set A, which completely describes the ANN architecture: e.g., number of layers, types of activation functions, and coefficients for neurons. The optimization problem, discussed in Section 3, can then be formulated for the price-based DR of the HVAC system using the data-driven equation set with A, the forecasted Et , and the announced Ct . The BEMS delivers the optimal Pt (i.e., Popt t ) to the VFD as Pref t via the communications links, and then receives the corresponding measured data of Tt (i.e., Tm t ). Note that we adopt a direct control method for the HVAC system [2], where Pref t is directly controlled to adjust Tt . As Pref t is almost the same as Pt due to the fast time response of the VFD, Pref t does not need to be included in the training data. The arrows numbered 8\u201314 indicate the data flows for the retail pricing strategy (i.e., the grid-side optimization problem) using the MP-enabled ANN. Specifically, an ANN is trained offline with historical data on the inputs and output of the DR strategy (i.e., [Et , Ct , Pt ]), such that it reflects the characteristics of the optimal response of the HVAC system to the time-varying electricity price and building environment (or, equivalently, to predict the optimal Pt for Ct and Et ). As in the case of the ANN-based building model, the trained ANN is represented using explicit equations with parameter set M. The CBO or end-users can provide M to the DSO as a condition of participating in the DR program, as they submit the physics-based model parameters and operational constraints of the HVAC systems and building thermal zones in conventional strategies [12,18]. Note that M is more easily obtainable and less privacy sensitive. The optimization problem, discussed in Section 4, is then formulated using the forecasted Et and the ANN equations with M, considering the DN voltage deviations ΔVn t . The DSO announces the optimal Ct (i.e., Copt t ) one day ahead and the CBOs then perform the DR for Copt t . The accuracy of ANN models relies on the size and variability of training data. In other words, the more historical data there are available for various conditions of HVAC system operation and building thermal environment, the higher the accuracy of the ANN-based building model in reflecting the indoor temperature variations in response to changes in the HVAC load demand and building thermal environment. In general, the historical data for initial ANN training vary little, because for the non-DR case, the operating profiles of the HVAC units do not change significantly unless the occupants complain. In new buildings, it is also possible that insufficient historical data have been collected. Therefore, after the initial training, the ANN then undergoes repeated online learning (corresponding to the data flows numbered 2 and 3), as the price-based DR is initiated and new data on the HVAC system operations and indoor temperature variations start to be obtained for various retail price and building environment profiles. This enables the ANN to adapt well to changes in the building operating conditions, gradually mitigating overfitting and improving model accuracy. In other words, the value of Tt estimated by the ANN becomes very similar to the value of Tm t measured in the building. Analogously, the data flows specified by the arrows numbered 8 and 9 are particularly active when online learning is applied to the MP-enabled ANN. The performance of the MP-enabled ANN and consequently that of the proposed pricing strategy improve gradually as the training data [Et , Ct , Pt ] are updated with new profiles of Copt t and Popt t obtained for the daily conditions of DN operation and buildings\u2019 environments. In other words, given Copt t , the profiles of Popt t predicted using the MP-enabled ANN and corresponding Tt estimated using the ANN-based building model become similar to those obtained by solving the DR optimization problem. Fig. 3 summarizes the online-learning steps for the ANN-based building model and the MP-enabled ANN as follows: Step 1) The proposed strategy is initiated with a moderate level of performance, resulting from the limited size and variability of the initial training data and hence the rather inaccurate ANN models. Step 2) The buildings\u2019 operating data are collected every day. The profiles of the HVAC systems\u2019 operation and indoor temperatures before and after the proposed strategy is initiated are likely to differ. The electricity price and the buildings\u2019 outdoor environments will also continue to change. Step 3) Using the newly collected data, the ANN models are re-trained periodically (or every day). The increased size and variability of the training data will improve the accuracy of the ANN models. Step 4) Using the retrained ANN models, the DSO and CBOs update the parameters in the constraints of the optimization problems for retail pricing and price-based DR, respectively. The improved accuracy of the ANNs will lead to expansion of the feasible solution areas for the optimization problems, improving the performance of the proposed strategy. Step 5) The DSO and CBOs solve the optimization problems. The optimal schedules of retail prices, HVAC loads, and indoor temperatures before and after the proposed strategy is updated are likely to differ. After Step 5 has been completed, Step 2 is then repeated using the new optimal schedules. 3 Price-based DR using the ANN-based building model 3.1 ANN-based building thermal model An ANN-based data-driven model is implemented to reflect the thermal dynamics of a single-zone building, specifically, to estimate Tt for Pt during the time period from t\u2013NAP to t, given Et over the period from t\u2013NAE to t. In general, Tt at the current time is affected by the past values of Pt and Et , due to the large thermal capacity inherent in the building structure. Moreover, for the same values of Pt and Et , Tt varies based on its previous values. In other words, Tt serves as both the state and output variables of the building thermal dynamic model. This implies that the thermal dynamics can be represented successfully using the ANN model with the time-delayed inputs of Pt and Et and the feedback loops of Tt . For example, the ANN can be designed in the form of a nonlinear auto-regressive network with exogenous inputs (NARX), as shown in Fig. 4 . We determined the numbers of time-delayed and feedback inputs NAE , NAP , and NAZ , considering the trade-off between the modeling accuracy of the ANN and the complexity of the optimization problem, as discussed in Section 3.2. For the same reason, a NARX was chosen with one hidden layer. The modeling accuracy can be enhanced by implementing the ANN in the sophisticated form of a multi-layer network with larger numbers of NAE , NAP , and NAZ . However, it requires additional constraints on the relations between the input and hidden layers, and between consecutive hidden layers, increasing the computational complexity. The ANN modeling accuracy was evaluated using the normalized mean squared error (NMSE) as: (1) e ( T ) = 1 - ∑ t N T T t - T t \u2032 2 ∑ t N T T t - T avg 2 , where Ttʹ is the predicted value of Tt and Tavg is the average of Tt in the training or test dataset during a scheduling day. Note that the coefficient of variation of root mean square error or mean bias error can be used [21] for data-driven model validation. Overfitting is a common issue in supervised learning. This occurs when an ANN is fitted to a particular set of training data and fails to reflect the general characteristics of the target model. Numerous methods were discussed to mitigate overfitting [22,23], which commonly aim to select the least over-fitted network of the candidates. This paper adopts the approach discussed in [23], where the overfitting index is evaluated to select an appropriate ANN architecture. Briefly, the index is estimated as low when for constant Et , Tt increases gradually as Pt decreases steadily to zero and, at the same time, Tt decreases as Pt increases to Pmax . The overfitting index is calculated repeatedly while the ANN architecture is varied within a search range pre-defined by, for example, the maximum time delays of the input and feedback data and the numbers of the activation function types and hidden neurons and layers. The ANN that has the lowest overfitting index and an NMSE higher than a threshold is selected; here, it is set to 0.9, based on the comparisons between the estimated and actual Tt . The ANN is then integrated into the DR optimization problem, as discussed in Section 3.2, and applied to online learning. This integration is readily achieved, because the connections between the input and output nodes of each ANN layer can be represented using linear equations, apart from the nodes for the activation function Fcn 1. Specifically, as shown in the ANN architecture (i.e., Fig. 4), the ith input neuron xAi t and the kth hidden neuron nAk t are linearly related as: (2) n Ak t = ∑ i = 1 N AF H Aki x Ai t + d Ak , ∀ i , ∀ k , ∀ t , where HAki and dAk are the data-driven coefficients (not the physics-based model coefficients) acquired from the ANN training. Note that xAi t is the normalized value, ranging from \u20131 to 1, of XAi t , given by: (3) - 2 ( X Ai , max - X Ai , min ) X Ai t + x Ai t = - 2 X Ai , min ( X Ai , max - X Ai , min ) - 1 , ∀ i , ∀ t , where XAi,max and XAi,min are the maximum and minimum values, respectively, of XAi t in the training dataset. Similarly, for nAk t in (2), the output node of Fcn 1 is estimated as: (4) m Ak t = F c n 1 n Ak t = 1 + exp - n Ak t - 1 , ∀ k , ∀ t , where a log sigmoid function is adopted; this function is commonly used [24,25]. As in (2), the output neuron gA t is related to mAk t in (4) as: (5) g A t = ∑ k = 1 N An L Ak · m Ak t + e A , ∀ k , ∀ t . As gA t is the normalized value of Tt due to the pre-processor (3), the post-processor is required to reverse transform gA t back into the same unit as the original training data Tt as: (6) - ( T Ao , max - T Ao , min ) 2 g A t + T t = ( T Ao , max - T Ao , min ) 2 + T Ao , min , ∀ t , where TAo,max and TAo,min are the maximum and minimum temperatures, respectively, in the training dataset. The parameter set A = [HAki , LAk , dAk , eA , TAo,max , TAo,min , XAi,max , XAi,min ] in (2)\u2013(6) can be extracted from the trained ANN using the Neural Network Toolbox in Matlab [26]. The set A also can be updated continuously, as the online learning of the ANN is conducted on a daily basis. Without any loss of generality, (2)\u2013(6) can be used with different architectures of the ANN. 3.2 Optimization problem formulation for price-based DR Using the ANN-based thermal dynamic model (i.e., (2)\u2013(6)), optimal day-ahead scheduling of the HVAC load demand Pt can be achieved by solving the DR optimization problem S1: S1: CBO\u2019s DR using the ANN-based building model (7) arg min P t J C = ∑ t = 1 N T C t · P t , subject to \u2022 Constraints on the physical conditions Tt and Pt (8) T min t ⩽ T t ⩽ T max t , ∀ t , (9) P min ⩽ P t ⩽ P max , ∀ t , (10) R N ⩽ P t - P t - Δ t / Δ t ⩽ R P , ∀ t , \u2022 Constraints on the relations among Tt, Pt, and Et of the ANN (11) n Ak t - ∑ i ∈ X AP N AP + 1 H Aki x Ai t - ∑ i ∈ X AZ N AZ H Aki x Ai t = ∑ i ∈ X AE N AE + 2 H Aki x Ai t + d Ak , ∀ i , ∀ k , ∀ t , and (3)\u2013(6), \u2022 Constraints on the current and time-delayed inputs of the ANN (12) α Aj t = E t - ( j - 2 ) Δ t , ∀ j ⩾ 2 , t ⩾ j Δ t , (13) α Aj t = E pre ( N T + ( t - ( j - 2 ) Δ t ) ) , ∀ j ⩾ 2 , t ⩽ ( j - 1 ) Δ t , (14) β Al t = P t - ( l - 1 ) Δ t , ∀ l , t ⩾ l Δ t , (15) β Al t = P pre ( N T + ( t - ( l - 1 ) Δ t ) ) , ∀ l , t ⩽ ( l - 1 ) Δ t , (16) γ Af t = T t - f Δ t , ∀ f , t ⩾ ( f + 1 ) Δ t , (17) γ Af t = T pre ( N T + ( t - f Δ t ) ) , ∀ f , t ⩽ f Δ t , (18) X Ai t ∈ t , α Aj = 2 t , · · · , α Aj = ( N AE + 2 ) t , β Al = 1 t , · · · , β Al = ( N AP + 1 ) t , γ Af = 1 t , · · · , γ Af = N Z t , ∀ i , ∀ t . As shown in (7), the CBO aims to minimize the daily electricity cost JC of the HVAC system for the time-varying Ct . In the first set of constraints, (8) shows that Tt should be maintained within an acceptable range to ensure occupants\u2019 thermal comfort. Moreover, (9) requires Pt to be maintained between Pmin and Pmax ; in this manuscript, Pmin and Pmax are set to zero and the rated value of the input power, respectively. The constraint (10) specifies the limits on the positive and negative ramp rates (i.e., RP and RN , respectively) of Pt . In general, VFD-equipped HVAC systems participate in DR programs in two ways: i.e., HVAC units are turned on and off, and the power inputs of the HVAC units are continuously adjusted up or down. In S1, the up-and-down variations in the power inputs to the HVAC units are optimally scheduled with a unit time interval of 1 h in response to the day-ahead retail electricity price Ct , as in [3] and [27]. The second set of constraints consists of (2)\u2013(6) to establish the relationship between Pt and Tt for Et using the ANN-based model of the building\u2019s thermal dynamics, rather than the physics-based one. Note that (2) can be expressed equivalently as (11), where xAi t is divided into three groups: i.e., the controllable and feedback variables (i.e., Pt and Tt for i ∈ XAP and XAZ , respectively) on the left side and the time and environmental parameters (i.e., t and Et for i ∈ XAE ) on the right side. Furthermore, (12)\u2013(17) indicate the constraints on the current and time-delayed values of Et and Pt , as well as the time-delayed values of Tt , which are delivered to the input neurons after data normalization. Specifically, (13), (15), and (17) represent the fact that the building operating data measured in the late evening of day d\u20131 are required to determine the optimal HVAC load schedule for the early morning of day d. The constraints (12), (14), and (16) show that after the early morning, the input neurons receive the forecast parameters Et and the decision variable Pt , as well as the corresponding feedback response Tt . Moreover, (18) lists the types of data that are fed to the input neurons, connecting the second and third constraint sets. Although this paper is focused on HVAC systems, both the ANN-based model and the DR optimization problem, discussed in Sections 3.1 and 3.2, respectively, can readily be applied to different types of interruptible or time-shiftable building loads (e.g., electric vehicles) with slight modification; this is the main advantage of the proposed ANN-based method over conventional physics-based methods. 4 Retail pricing considering the DR of HVAC units 4.1 Meta-prediction of the optimal HVAC load schedule Fig. 5 a shows a simplified schematic diagram of the proposed retail pricing strategy, focusing on the data flows for the online training and application of the MP-enabled ANN. Specifically, the optimization problem S1 (i.e., (3)\u2013(18)) is repeatedly solved offline to obtain the optimal Pt (i.e., Popt t ) and corresponding Tt for the historical data Ct and Et . The dataset of [Et , Ct , Pt ] can then be established to train another ANN, in which the output is set to Popt t and the inputs include the current and time-delayed values of [t, Et , Ct ] and the feedback values of Popt t , as shown in Fig. 5b. After training, the ANN becomes capable of directly predicting (i.e., meta-predicting) Popt t for the day-ahead Ct , given the forecast of Et . In other words, the MP-enabled ANN can function as a price-and-optimal-demand curve, unlike the analytic functions and the price sensitivity coefficients [13\u201316], as discussed in Section 1. Using the ANN-based curve, the proposed pricing strategy can be developed in a single-level structure, as discussed in Section 4.2, without the need to solve S1. For simplicity, the MP-enabled ANN is also designed in the form of a NARX, shown in Fig. 4; a sophisticated form can still be adopted, considering the trade-off between the prediction accuracy and computational complexity. As in Section 3.1, a specific architecture of the NARX has been selected using the NMSE e(P) and the overfitting index, which are calculated by replacing Tt in (1) with Pt and measuring the variations in Pt for changes in Ct , respectively. The MP-enabled ANN is then transformed into a set of explicit equations with parameter set M = [HMki , LMk , dMk , eM , PMo,max , PMo,min , XMi,max , XMi,min ], which can be readily extracted as in the case of A. The equation set is then integrated directly into the optimal pricing strategy. The optimal HVAC load schedules are mainly affected by relative variations in retail price over time, rather than the fixed part of pricing that is likely to increase annually due to inflation. Moreover, the ramp rates of retail prices, and the difference between the maximum and minimum prices, are often specified as constraints to ensure low-level volatility and alleviate the risk of a DSO increasing its profit excessively [28]. Therefore, in general, the retail prices vary relatively smoothly and within a narrow band during a day, as discussed in Section 5. In practice, the prices may occasionally increase sharply or decrease to less than zero; for the extreme cases, the MP performance can become rather degraded due to the limited amount of corresponding data. To mitigate the degradation, the ANN is updated periodically via online learning. In other words, after the proposed pricing strategy has been initiated with a rather moderate level of performance, online learning is applied to the MP-enabled ANN, as the new profiles of Copt t and Popt t are obtained under various Et (see Fig. 5a); this will gradually improve the MP performance. 4.2 Optimization problem formulation for retail pricing Using the MP-enabled ANN, the DSO can determine the optimal retail price Ct and corresponding input power Phvt of HVAC unit h at DN bus v, induced by Ct , by solving the single-level problem S2 as: S2: DSO\u2019s retail pricing using the ANN-based MP (19) arg max C t , P hvt J D = ∑ t = 1 N T ∑ v ∈ V B N B ∑ h = 1 N H v ( C t - L t ) · P hvt , subject to \u2022 Constraints on the relations among Ct, Pt, and Et of the ANN (20) n Mk hvt - ∑ i ∈ X MC hv N MC hv + 1 H Mki hv x Mi hvt - ∑ i ∈ X MP hv N MP hv H Mki hv x Mi hvt = ∑ i ∈ X ME hv N ME hv + 2 H Mki hv x Mi hvt + d Mk hv , ∀ i , ∀ k , ∀ t , ∀ h , ∀ v , (21)\u2013(24) ( 3 ) - ( 6 ) u s i n g t h e s e t o f M \u2022 Constraints on the current and time-delayed inputs of the ANN (25) ω Mq hvt = C t - ( q - 1 ) Δ t , ∀ q , ∀ h , ∀ v , t ⩾ q Δ t , (26) ω Mq hvt = C pre ( N T + ( t - ( q - 1 ) Δ t ) ) , ∀ q , ∀ h , ∀ v , t ⩽ ( q - 1 ) Δ t , (27) β Ml hvt = P hv ( t - l Δ t ) , ∀ l , ∀ h , ∀ v , t ⩾ ( l + 1 ) Δ t , (28) β Ml hvt = P pre hv ( N T + ( t - l Δ t ) ) , ∀ l , ∀ h , ∀ v , t ⩽ l Δ t , (29) X Mi hvt ∈ t , α Mj = 2 hvt , · · · , α Mj = ( N ME hv + 2 ) hvt , ω Mq = 1 hvt , · · · , ω Mq = ( N MC hv + 1 ) hvt , β Ml = 1 hvt , · · · , β Ml = N MP hv hvt , ∀ i , ∀ t , ∀ h , ∀ v , and (12) and (13), \u2022 Constraints on the operational conditions Ct and ΔVn t (30) C min t ⩽ C t ⩽ C max t , ∀ t , (31) C N ⩽ C t - C t - Δ t / Δ t ⩽ C P , ∀ t , (32) - Δ V max ⩽ Δ V n t = S V , P t S V , Q t Δ P t Δ Q t T ⩽ Δ V max , for t ps ⩽ t ⩽ t pe , ∀ n , (33) ∑ h = 1 N H v P hvt + ∑ h = 1 N X v P c hvt = P o vt , ∀ t , ∀ v , (34) P o vt = P o 1 t , P o 13 t , ⋯ P o vt , ⋯ P o 101 t T , ∀ t , ∀ v , (35) B = b 11 b 12 ⋯ b 1 v ⋯ b 21 b 22 ⋯ b 2 v ⋯ ⋮ ⋮ ⋱ ⋮ ⋯ b n 1 b n 2 ⋯ b nv ⋯ ⋮ ⋮ ⋮ ⋮ ⋱ , ∀ n , ∀ v , (36) b nv = 1 3 1 3 1 3 O 1 × 3 T , for n = v , O 6 × 1 , for n ≠ v , (37) Δ P t Δ Q t T = B · P o vt = P o , a 1 t P o , b 1 t P o , c 1 t O 1 × 3 , O 1 × 6 , ⋯ , P o , a 13 t P o , b 13 t P o , c 13 t O 1 × 3 , O 1 × 6 , ⋯ , P o , a vt P o , b vt P o , c vt O 1 × 3 , O 1 × 6 , ⋯ T , ∀ v , ∀ t . In S2, the retail price Ct and the corresponding HVAC loads Phvt are scheduled for the day-ahead time horizon, based on the forecast of the day-ahead wholesale price Lt . In other words, to procure the energy for the HVAC loads, the retailer participates in the wholesale market as a price-taker agent with no market power capability to change the market clearing results, as in [29]. This enables simple implementation and broad application of the retail pricing strategy for optimal use of buildings\u2019 thermal flexibility, with no need to consider the detailed specifications of the wholesale market structure, which differs from country to country. Various techniques for forecasting the day-ahead electricity price have already been developed [29]. Note that price uncertainty and hence power trading in intraday markets have not been considered here for simplicity. Moreover, in S2, the \u201ctotal DSO\u201d model [30] has been adopted, in which a distribution utility operates as a DSO that takes on the functions of an ISO but at the distribution level. The DSO is responsible for maintaining the balance between supply and demand and operational stability in the distribution grid by incorporating the optimal DR of HVAC systems in both retail market settlement and distribution grid operation. In other words, the DSO plays the role of the retailer or vice versa. Therefore, in S2, optimal retail pricing is achieved considering the optimal DR of the HVAC loads for the retail price (20)\u2013(29) and the effects of the optimal HVAC load responses on DN voltage variations (32)\u2013(37). Note that (20)\u2013(29) represent the explicit replication of the MP-enabled ANN, as in (3)\u2013(18) for the ANN-based building model. Specifically, in (19), the DSO\u2019s profit JD is defined as the revenue earned by selling electricity to the HVAC systems at Ct minus the cost of procuring the electricity from a day-ahead energy market at Lt . As in Section 3.2, the first constraint set (20)\u2013(24) represents the relationship between Ct and Pt of the MP-enabled ANN for each HVAC unit, given the day-ahead forecast of Et . Note that M is used here, instead of A. For example, as in (11), (20) specifies the relationship between xMi hvt and nMk hvt , where xMi hvt is divided into three groups: i.e., XMC hv , XMP hv , and XME hv . The terms on the left side include the controllable and feedback variables, and the terms on the right side consist of time and environmental parameters. The second set includes the constraints on the current and time-delayed values of Ct and Et (i.e., controllable and independent inputs, respectively) and the time-delayed values of Pt (i.e., feedback inputs) that are fed into the input neurons of the MP-enabled ANN. As discussed in Section 4.1, (30) and (31) are necessary to achieve low-level price volatility. In (30), the price cap Cmax t aims to mitigate the risk of the DSO excessively increasing its profit, which is unfair to the CBOs. By (31), the ramp rates of Ct are limited to prevent abrupt changes in Phvt and, hence, severe increases in the operating stress and maintenance costs of the HVAC units. These constraints can be brought into effect via mutual agreement between the DSO and CBOs [28]. While maximizing the profit, the DSO is responsible for stable operation of the DN [18]. In this paper, to ensure grid voltage stability, (32) specifies that the incremental variations in the voltage ΔVn t at all buses n ∈ VA , owing to the total HVAC load demand [ΔPt , ΔQt ] T , should be maintained within the limits ± ΔVmax , particularly during the on-peak hours: i.e., tps ≤ t ≤ tpe . Specifically, ΔVn t is calculated using the sensitivity matrices SV,P t and SV,Q t , which can be derived from general power flow equations for a three-phase (3-ph) unbalanced DN [31], given the forecast of the total network load demand. In (33), Po vt is represented as the total sum of the power inputs Phvt and Pc hvt of the price-sensitive and price-inelastic HVAC units, respectively, at bus v ∈ VB . A column vector Po vt is then established using Po vt as elements, as shown in (34). Moreover, a conversion matrix B is defined in (35) and (36), so that Po vt is converted into another column vector [ΔPt , ΔQt ] T , as shown in (37), where each element in Po vt is relocated considering the DN topology. As an example, (37) describes [ΔPt , ΔQt ] T for the IEEE 123-Node Test Feeder, discussed in Section 5, where the HVAC units are connected to the pre-specified buses: i.e., v ∈ VB = {1, 13, 18, 42, 47, 52, 57, 60, 63, 67, 76, 81, 89, 97, 101}. As shown in (37), [ΔPt , ΔQt ] T contains 6∙NA elements for an NA -bus grid. For n = v, each set of six elements represents the 3-ph active and reactive power for phases a, b, and c (i.e., [Po,a vt , Po,b vt , Po,c vt , Q o,a vt , Q o,b vt , Q o,c vt ] T ) of the total HVAC load at bus v. For simplicity, the HVAC units are assumed to operate as 3-ph balanced loads with a unity power factor (i.e., Po,a vt = Po,b vt = Po,c vt = Po vt /3 and Qo,a vt = Qo,b vt = Qo,c vt = 0); analysis of the effects of the non-zero reactive power of the HVAC load on retail electricity pricing is left for future work. Due to the explicit expressions of the ANN-based building model and the MP-enabled ANN, an off-the-shelf nonlinear programming solver can be applied to S1 and S2, ensuring the near-global optimality of the solutions. Both S1 and S2 were formulated using Matlab and solved with the library function of a GAMS solver [32]. For various types of HVAC units and thermal zones, S1 still can be used; the values of A can be readily modified using the corresponding operating data. In addition, S2 can be used readily for a DN, including a number of HVAC systems with different DR characteristics, by taking advantage of the MP: i.e., easy determination and access to M. 5 Case studies and results 5.1 Test system and simulation conditions The proposed strategy was tested on the IEEE 123-Node Test Feeder, shown in Fig. 6 , slightly modified based on [33]. This includes 1-ph loads and 3-ph balanced and unbalanced loads with a rated line voltage of 4.16 kV. A 24-h profile of the load demand during summer time was obtained from [34] and scaled down, so that the peak load demand in the test DN was equal to 7.04 MW, as shown in Fig. 7 a. Commercial buildings containing price-sensitive or price-inelastic HVAC units are located at 15 buses, each of which is marked by a red circle in Fig. 6. The total number and capacity of the HVAC units were set to 12 and 195.8 kW, respectively, at each of the 15 buses. An experimental test building [8] was considered, as shown in Fig. 8 , for the data acquisition and comparative case studies. Briefly, the experimental building is divided into test and climate chambers, both of which are within a larger laboratory room in which the indoor temperature is maintained at an almost constant level. The test chamber includes lights and heat sources to simulate the internal heat gains of a common office, and the climate chamber contains a separate HVAC unit to emulate the outdoor environment. In [8] and [9], a building simulator was developed using an inverse transfer function to estimate Tt for Pt , given Et = [Ta t , Tx t , Qi t ]. The simulator was run using the data of Tx t measured from April 1 to September 30 in the years 2012 and 2013 in Boston, MA [35], and of Qi t estimated based on the operation of a real test building at Boston University [6] (see Fig. 7b and c, respectively). The case studies also can be performed using the benchmark values of Qi t , estimated based on measurements and surveys of a number of buildings of particular types and usages [36,37]. In Fig. 7c, Qi t is increased at t = 7 h and maintained at high levels until t = 19 h, when people start arriving at work and leaving the building, respectively. Furthermore, Fig. 7d shows the 24-h profiles of Ct at the distribution level [18,38], as well as of time-of-use (TOU) rates [39], in the initial training data. The hourly-varying retail prices can assist the DSO in better exploiting the operational flexibility of DR resources and attracting more consumers to price-based DR rather than TOU rates, in which only a few (on-peak, off-peak, and mid-peak) rates exist and do not change for months [40]. We set Cmax t in (30) using the profile of the TOU rates, assuming that the DSO applies the TOU rates to price-inelastic (i.e., non-DR) HVAC loads [18]. These rates are simpler and higher than the retail pricing rates, thus increasing the profit. Flat rates can also be used. Moreover, Cmin t was set to Lt [41] to guarantee at least the minimum profit of the DSO in the DR business. The ANN-based thermal model and the MP-enabled ANN were trained initially with the datasets of [t, Et , Tt , Pt , Ct ], whose size was set to 1200 (i.e., 50 days) with respect to time, and updated repeatedly via online learning, as the new profiles of [Et , Tt , Pt , Ct ] were obtained from S1 and S2. Note that the initial training datasets included only the historical profiles of Ct between Cmin t and Cmax t . 5.2 Online learning of the ANNs for DR and retail pricing Fig. 9 a shows the results of e(T) when online learning of the ANN-based building model was performed daily over 190 days; the parameter set A was updated at the end of each scheduling time period (i.e., t = NT ). For each day, e(T) was calculated, as shown in Fig. 10 a, by comparing the profiles of Tt that were obtained from S1 and the building simulator for the optimal Pt . In general, e(T) increased gradually, indicating improvement in the modeling accuracy, as the CBO continued the online learning after initiating the DR strategy. This confirms that the ANN-based model in the single-hidden-layer form of a NARX, shown in Fig. 4, successfully reflects the complex thermal response of the experimental building. After e(T) reached a value higher than 0.99 for five consecutive days, the model was used to develop the MP-enabled ANN for S2. In [42] and [43], the performance of ANNs was considered good when the NMSEs were higher than a threshold ranging between 0.86 and 0.95, approximately. Analogously, Fig. 9b shows e(P) when the online learning of the MP-enabled ANN model was conducted daily for an additional 190 days, updating the parameter set M every day at t = NT . To calculate e(P), the 24-h profiles of Pt were obtained from S2 using the MP-enabled ANN and compared to those acquired from S1 for the optimal Ct , as shown in Fig. 10b. Moreover, the ANN-based building model was trained online with the new building operating data obtained over a period of 190 days. Considering the computational burden, the training was conducted rather periodically; in Fig. 9b, the red arrows indicate the periods, ranging from approximately 30 days to 45 days. This improved the online learning performance of the MP-enabled ANN further. Noticeable reductions in e(P) were observed occasionally, unlike in the case of e(T); however, it can be seen that e(P) still gradually increased from 0.26 to 0.86 (gradient of 2.2 × 10−3 per day), as the online learning continued. This verifies the possibility that the online-trained, MP-enabled ANNs can better reflect the optimal operating characteristics of HVAC systems for time-varying retail prices, as larger volumes of data on the weather, retail price, and building operation are collected with higher granularity. Since there have been few attempts to develop MP-enabled ANNs, the application of more sophisticated ANN models is well worth investigating. 5.3 Comparison between the proposed and ideal DR strategies Using the ANN-based building model, S1 was solved to determine the optimal HVAC load schedule for the 24-h profiles of Ct and Tx t , shown in Fig. 11 a and 11b, respectively. Fig. 11c shows the optimal profile of Pt (i.e., the blue line) for the proposed DR strategy using the ANN-based building model in comparison to that (i.e., the red line) for the ideal DR strategy using the fully informed physics-based building model. In [18], the ideal strategy was discussed, based on the assumption that CBOs or end-users are informed of all of the modeling parameters required to estimate Tt for Pt and Et , rather than measured data on the building operation. Since this assumption is not valid in practice, the strategy is regarded as an ideal case. Note that for the physics-based model, the constraints on indoor temperature control were relaxed to solve the DR optimization problem reliably by including penalty terms on temperature deviations in the objective function: i.e., min Σ t (Ct ·Pt + Cpenalty ·(ΔTmin t + ΔTmax t )) where Tmin t \u2013 ΔTmin t ≤ Tt ≤ Tmax t + ΔTmax t , ΔTmin t ≥ 0, and ΔTmax t ≥ 0. Fig. 11c also shows the profile for the non-DR case (i.e., the black line), in which Pt was controlled to maintain Tt at 25 °C during the period 8 h ≤ t ≤ 19 h. In addition, Fig. 11d represents the corresponding profiles of Tt for the proposed, ideal, and non-DR cases. For the DR cases, large values of Pt were scheduled for 1 h ≤ t ≤ 6 h, unlike the non-DR case, whereas Tx t and Qi t were high during the daytime, as shown in Fig. 11c and d. In other words, the HVAC system operated in the pre-cooling mode; Pt was shifted to the early morning when Ct remained low, leading to the reduction in JC . In Fig. 11d, Tt increased gradually from 20 °C at t = 8 h to 25 °C at t = 13 h, due to the limited thermal capacity of the building structure. To maintain Tt below Tmax t , Pt began to increase at t = 13 h. As shown in Table 1 , JC for the proposed DR case was $5.86 (57.51%) lower than JC for the non-DR case. Note that TOU rates were applied to the non-DR, price-inelastic HVAC load, as discussed in Section 5.1. In Fig. 11c, the optimal profile of Pt for the proposed DR case is rather similar to that for the ideal DR case, resulting in comparable HVAC-system operating costs for the proposed and ideal cases. In Fig. 11d, the temperature differences between the proposed and ideal profiles over a 24-h period are very small, due to the large thermal capacity of the building\u2019s structure. Specifically, the optimal Pt for the proposed case is lower during most of the period 1 h ≤ t ≤ 6 h than that for the ideal case. In other words, the pre-cooling energy supplied by the HVAC system is lower for the ANN-based method than for the physics-based method. Therefore, using the ANN-based method, the HVAC system operates with larger Pt for the period 9 h ≤ t ≤ 11 h than when using the physics-based method. Note that the ANN-based method still leads to slightly lower values of Tt during the period 9 h ≤ t ≤ 11 h than does the physics-based method, as shown in the close-up plot of Fig. 11d. It is also possible that the marginal error in the ANN-based building model is reflected in the optimal profiles of Pt and Tt , although the ANN-based model is fairly accurate, as shown in Fig. 9. Fig. 11d shows that the thermal comfort band ranges from Tmin t = 13 °C to Tmax t = 30 °C during the pre-cooling period, when a commercial building is usually unoccupied. Therefore, the decrease in Tt to approximately 16 °C at t = 6 h does not violate the constraint (8) regarding occupants\u2019 thermal comfort: i.e., Tmin t ≤ Tt ≤ Tmax t . Fig. 11d also shows that Tt is successfully maintained within a narrow band between Tmin t = 20 °C and Tmax t = 25 °C during the period 8 h ≤ t ≤ 19 h, when people are at work in the building. 5.4 Proposed retail pricing using the MP-enabled ANNs Using the MP-enabled ANNs, S2 was solved to determine the optimal Ct and estimate the corresponding Pt , Tt , and ΔVn t . For simplicity, all entries of the matrix ΔVmax in (32) were assumed to have the same value ΔVmax . The largest voltage deviation ΔVt was observed at Bus 95 of the test grid; the other DN buses had similar voltage profiles but with smaller deviations, which were omitted for brevity. Fig. 12 represents the optimal solution to S2 for ΔVmax = 0.07 pu. It can be seen in Fig. 12d that (32) was unbounded: i.e., |ΔVt | < ΔVmax for 12 ≤ t ≤ 19. In other words, the voltage stability during the on-peak hours could already be ensured without using the demand-side flexibility. It was then unnecessary for the DSO to shift the HVAC loads across hours by reducing Ct during the off-peak hours. Consequently, Ct was maintained at high levels to maximize the profit JD . Note that the profile of Ct in Fig. 12a is significantly different from those of Ct shown in Fig. 7d. This indicates that the optimal solutions acquired using the online supervised learning are not confined by the historical training data: i.e., the overfitting issue was resolved. Fig. 12b shows that Pt was shifted less to the off-peak hours compared to Pt in Fig. 11c (see the blue line). Consequently, JC increased from $4.33 to $7.96; note that it was still $2.23 (21.88%) lower than JC for the non-DR case. The case study was repeated for ΔVmax = 0.06 pu and 0.05 pu. The constraint (32) became stricter and hence bounded: i.e., max(|ΔVt |) = ΔVmax for 12 ≤ t ≤ 19. The DSO needs to exploit the operational flexibility of the HVAC units (or equivalently shift Pt ) to ensure voltage stability during the on-peak hours by reducing Ct over the off-peak hours. In Fig. 13 a, Ct for ΔVmax = 0.05 pu was determined to be lower during 1 h ≤ t ≤ 10 h than that for ΔVmax = 0.07 pu, inducing a larger shift of Pt to satisfy (32). The values of ∑ t = 1 t s - 1 P t were estimated as 72.9 kWh, 75.2 kWh, and 121.6 kWh for ΔVmax = 0.07 pu, 0.06 pu, and 0.05 pu, respectively. The case study results verified that the proposed pricing strategy enables the DSO to resolve effectively the grid voltage issues by adjusting retail prices and inducing the pre-cooling of the HVAC systems. As listed in Table 2 , this led to a decrease in the DSO\u2019s profit from JD = $430.62 to $170.03, as ΔVmax was reduced from 0.07 pu to 0.05 pu; however, this can be compensated for by the savings in the costs of installing additional voltage-regulating devices and communication links over a wide range of locations in the DN. Table 2 also shows that as ΔVmax was reduced, the sum of JC for all the price-sensitive HVAC loads was reduced from $836.15 to $515.02, indicating that the operational flexibility of the HVAC systems became more valuable for smaller values of ΔVmax . These results demonstrate that the proposed simple single-level strategy using the MP-enabled ANNs successfully reflects the game-theoretic relationships between the DSO and CBOs in the retail electricity market, with consideration of the DN voltage stability. Therefore, the DSO does not have to rely on the conventional bi-level structure. Similar results are expected when the proposed strategy is developed considering, for example, line power losses and line thermal limits. Note that for the non-DR case, JD and the sum of JC were estimated as $515.45 and $1052.51, respectively, and the largest voltage deviation was 0.074 pu at Bus 95 at t = 17. Figs. 12b and 13b show the optimal profiles of Pt (i.e., PMP , PANN , and Pphy ) corresponding to the solutions of the problems, respectively, for the proposed pricing S2, the proposed DR S1, and the ideal DR [18] with the fully informed building model. Note that the proposed and ideal DR problems were solved for the optimal Ct obtained from S2. The optimal profiles of Pt are similar particularly during the daytime, resulting in the comparable values of both JD and the sum of JC for the cases of PMP and PANN ; Table 2 shows that the maximum relative difference was estimated as 7% for all ΔVmax . This verifies the accuracy and applicability of the MP-enabled ANN. The differences among the profiles for t ≤ 5 h were attributed mainly to the fact that the time-delayed Pt in (15) and (28) was zero during this period, contributing little to the ANN training. As in Section 5.3, the differences in Pt marginally affected Tt (see Figs. 12c and 13c), indicating that the proposed pricing strategy ensured occupants\u2019 thermal comfort. 5.5 Application of the proposed strategy to other building loads The proposed ANN-based strategy can readily be applied to different types of interruptible or time-shiftable loads. Most of the constraints in S1 and S2 [e.g., (3)\u2013(6), (11)\u2013(18), and (20)\u2013(29)] can remain the same, although the numerical values of the constraint parameters differ by load. Therefore, S1 and S2 can easily be re-formulated or extended according to available building loads. Figs. 14 and 15 show the case study results when the proposed ANN-based strategy was applied to behind-the-meter batteries for price-based DR and retail electricity pricing, respectively. It can be seen that the optimal profiles obtained using the ANN-based battery model in the proposed strategy are similar to those acquired using the fully informed physics-based model in the ideal strategy. Moreover, the analyses discussed in Sections 5.3 and 5.4 can be well applied to the results. This confirms the effectiveness and wide applicability of the proposed ANN-based strategy. 6 Discussion The case study results discussed in Section 5 confirmed that in the proposed ANN-based, single-level strategy, the CBO\u2019s operating cost JC , the DSO\u2019s retail profit JD , and the optimal profiles of Ct , Pt , and Tt were similar to those derived from the conventional physics-based, bi-level strategy. In addition to JC and JD , the data requirement and the computation time can be used as indices to clarify the advantages of the proposed strategy over the conventional strategy, particularly with respect to the characteristics of ANN-based and physics-based building modeling and the computational performance of the single-level and bi-level decision-making procedures, respectively. In this paper, the data requirement is evaluated based on the availability of building parameters that need to be measured or estimated for the formulation of the DR optimization problem S1. The computation time is defined as the time required to solve the pricing optimization problem S2. Note that for the conventional strategy, the optimization problems for price-based DR and retail pricing were presented as S1 and S3, respectively, in [18]. The proposed strategy has a lower data requirement; the conventional strategy requires information on, for example, the cooling (or heating) rate supplied by the HVAC equipment and the geometry and materials of the building\u2019s envelope. Building owners and end-users tend to be either unaware of, or reluctant to provide, such information. This confirms that the proposed strategy is more readily applicable to real buildings compared to the conventional strategy. The proposed strategy can also be implemented more securely, reducing the risk that a building\u2019s information is exposed and occupants\u2019 privacy is violated. Moreover, for the test distribution grid, the computation time was estimated to be 234.54 s using the proposed strategy, whereas it was estimated to be 2941.6 s using the conventional strategy. The reduced computation time is attributable mainly to the decreased complexity of the decision-making procedure in the proposed strategy: i.e., the number of primary and auxiliary decision variables in the pricing optimization problem. This verifies that, in practice, the proposed strategy can be more easily applied to large-scale distribution networks, facilitating integration of greater demand-side thermal energy flexibility into the day-ahead electricity market. 7 Conclusion This paper proposes a new retail-pricing strategy considering the data-driven, price-based DR of HVAC systems in a single-level decision-making structure. The proposed strategy consists of the CBO-side optimization problems for price-based DR and the DSO-side optimization problem for retail pricing. Each CBO-side problem is established using the ANN-based model of building thermal dynamics and then converted to the MP-enabled ANN that can be integrated directly into the DSO-side optimization problem. In this way, the optimization problems can be solved simultaneously without mathematical reformulation using the KKT conditions, while still reflecting the game-theoretic relations between the DSO and CBOs. Therefore, the proposed strategy is more efficient and practical for use in real retail markets, relieving the DSO of the need to adopt the conventional bi-level structure. The case study results confirm that the proposed strategy is effective in exploiting the thermal energy storage capacity of buildings\u2019 structures to maximize retail-business profit and minimize buildings\u2019 electricity costs, while ensuring voltage stability and occupants\u2019 thermal comfort. The main features of the proposed strategy are as follows: \u2022 An ANN-based building model is implemented to reflect a building\u2019s thermal response to HVAC system operation. An MP-enabled ANN model is also developed to reflect the sensitivity of optimal HVAC system operation to retail pricing and a building\u2019s environment. \u2022 The ANN models are replicated using sets of explicit equations that can be integrated directly into the optimization problems for price-based DR and retail pricing. This enables application of a deterministic solver, ensuring near-global optimality and high reliability of solutions. \u2022 As new data are acquired regarding the daily conditions of DN operation and buildings\u2019 environments, the ANN models undergo online learning, improving the modeling accuracy and the scheduling performance. The main findings of the case studies can be summarized as follows: \u2022 The optimal profiles of the retail price and the HVAC loads using the proposed ANN-based strategy were similar to those obtained using the conventional fully-informed physics-based strategy. \u2022 The proposed strategy effectively induced low electricity prices in the early morning and hence pre-cooling operation of the HVAC system, reducing its operating cost significantly. \u2022 As the maximum voltage deviation limit was reduced, demand-side thermal flexibility became more valuable. The DSO exploited the thermal energy flexibility of commercial buildings to ensure DN voltage stability during on-peak hours by reducing retail prices during off-peak hours. Further work is required particularly with regard to application of the proposed strategy to a variety of different price-sensitive building loads. The historical operating data of such building loads need to be collected and pre-processed for the application. It is also worth investigating the use of different machine learning models (e.g., support vector machines and random decision forests) for the proposed strategy, based on the operating characteristics of individual building loads.

        "dc:description": "This paper proposes an online-learning-based strategy for a distribution system operator (DSO) to determine optimal retail prices, considering the optimal operations of heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems in commercial buildings. An artificial neural network (ANN) is trained online with building energy data and represented using an explicit set of linear and nonlinear equations. An optimization problem for price-based demand response (DR) is then formulated using the explicit ANN model and repeatedly solved, producing data on optimal HVAC load schedules for various profiles of electricity prices and building environments. Another ANN is then trained online to predict directly the optimal load schedules, which is referred to as meta-prediction (MP). By replacing the DR optimization problem with the MP-enabled ANN, optimal retail electricity pricing can be achieved using a single-level decision-making structure. Consequently, the pricing optimization problem becomes simplified, enabling easier implementation and increased scalability for HVAC systems in a large distribution grid. In case studies, the proposed single-level pricing strategy is verified to successfully reflect the game-theoretic relations between the DSO and building operators, such that they effectively achieve their own objectives via the operational flexibility of the HVAC systems, while ensuring grid voltage stability and occupants\u2019 thermal comfort.",
