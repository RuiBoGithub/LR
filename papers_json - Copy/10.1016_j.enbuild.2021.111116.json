Displacement ventilation system is a proven way to save energy by controlling the local preservation environment for the unearthed relics in site museums. In this study, the influences of air inlet/outlet arrangement as well as the earthen site temperature on the performance of the local environment control system were investigated. The results demonstrate that, in addition to achieving a significant reduction in energy consumption, the displacement ventilation system can also achieve local environmental control within the preservation area of a large exhibition hall, while establishing an equilibrium of the soil-air environment. Moreover, by reducing the height of the return air inlet and the effective height of the environmental control area, energy savings of 47.7\u201365.9% can be achieved. Moving the position of the air supply outlet to the bottom of the pit has little effect on overall environmental control, while adjusting the air supply temperature to match that of the soil at the bottom of the relic preservation area can effectively reduce environmental disturbance, achieving uniformity and environmental stability. These research results provide not only an effective solution for local environmental control of the relics in site museums, but also a basis for the functioning of the displacement ventilation system within the site exhibition hall. Keywords Displacement ventilation Large space exhibition hall Relic conservation Soil-air coupling environment 1 Introduction Number of museums is growing rapidly around the world. The United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization reported that in 2020 there were about 95,000 museums worldwide, which is an increase of 60% compared to 2012 [1]. Museums for the conservation of cultural heritage can be broadly categorized as indoor-display museums and site museums [2]. In indoor-display museum, collections are usually preserved in sealed cabins or showcases, which provide a good prerequisite for preciseenvironmental control of the preservation area [3-5]. The site museums were built mainly for the protection of immovable unearthed historical site. The relics preservation area of this type of museum is usually a semi-underground space [6], such as the Emperor Qin\u2019s Mausoleum Site Museum in China (Fig. 1 a). More than 770,000 immovable relics have been identified in China, and hundreds of site museums have been built so far to preserve and exhibit the precious unearthed relics. The unearthed relics in site museum are usually semi-buried in the soil, while the remaining parts are directly exposed to visitors (Fig. 1b). Accordingly, the precious unearthed relics and visitors are sharing the same open space of the exhibition hall. Environmental control for such a large exhibition hall becomes a challenging task due to the conflicting thermal requirements of relics and visitors [7,8]. Stability, uniformity and suitability of environmental parameters in the museum are important factors that affect both the deterioration of relics and the thermal comfort of visitors [9-11]. Environmental control is highly valued by museum designers and relics management personnel, especially given that current concepts of relic conservation are shifting from \u201crescue restoration\u201d strategies to a \u201cpreventive conservation\u201d approach [12,13]. HVAC systems represent a crucial preventive method of conservation in the fight against relic deterioration and other environmental risks [14-17]. However, due to the complex functionality and requirements of most site museum buildings, such as expansive space layout, diverse requirements of the hygrothermal environment, precise requirements for preservation environment, and continuous operation of the air conditioning system throughout the year, the HVAC system tends to consume large amounts of energy [18]. Cao et al. [19] estimated that if the air conditioning system was installed in the exhibition hall No. 1 of the Emperor Qin\u2019s Mausoleum Site Museum, energy consumption per unit area would be higher than 179 W/m2. Significant energy consumption has brought a great economic burden to the work of the museum. Therefore, the question of how to provide a suitable environment for the preservation of relics, while reducing the operational energy consumption, has become a key issue in the field of relic conservation in recent years [9,20]. Much previous work has been invested in improving the operational efficiency of museum air conditioning systems. Zhang et al. [21] proposed an independent temperature and relative humidity (RH) control strategy designed to maintain a stable preservation environment for the museum\u2019s collection storeroom. The proposed scheme would not only provide a precisely controlled environment with constant temperature and RH, but would also overcome the energy loss caused by the air reheating process, thus achieving a 21.7% reduction in energy consumption compared to a traditional air conditioning system. To achieve the goal of net zero energy consumption for museum buildings, Arroyo et al. [22] presented the \u201cchoosing by advantages\u201d (CBA) method, which is based on a comprehensive consideration of social, environmental and economic benefits, and achieved selection optimization and decision-making for the air conditioning system of a museum building with net zero energy consumption. Kramer et al. [23] improved the thermal comfort of the environment for visitors in the exhibition hall and mitigated the deterioration rate of relics by optimizing the range of adjustment of air conditioning system parameters, reducing energy consumption by 77% compared to pre-optimization levels. To reduce the impact of environmental fluctuations in personnel areas on the collections of historical churches, Europe has adopted the Friendly-Heating project [24]. This project uses seat radiant heating in public sitting areas, significantly reducing the environmental impact on delicate relics and greatly reducing overall energy consumption of the environmental control system. Suitable ambient temperature and RH is another concern to museums. Many specifications, including ASHRAE [25], Italy\u2019s UNI 10,829 [26], and the Chinese Museum Design Code [27], suggest optimal preservation parameters and risk levels under undesirable conditions for cultural relics of various materials. These standards have become important guides for relics conservation. In recent years, numerous studies have been published on temperature and RH control for conservation needs [28,29]. Ferdyn-Grygierek et al. [28] proposed novel and proven control strategies to drastically reduce temperature and RH fluctuations in museums. The method controls RH by changing the ventilation airflow or by changing the temperature, instead of using a humidification and dehumidification devices, the period with the small relative humidity fluctuations (<±5%) increased from 2% to 88% in the warm season. Fragile artifacts typically require a very demanding preservation environment, and Schijndel et al. [29] developed an integrated heat, air and moisture model to design a HVAC system to preserve old museum paper collections, and then successfully proposed a new control strategy to satisfy the indoor climate requirements. However, most of these strategies and standards are primarily focused on collections housed in a contained environment or repository, which may be inappropriate for the unearthed relics in site museums and their soil-air coupling preservation environments (see Fig. 1b). The reasons mainly lie in the following facts: 1) non-equilibrium between the soil and the air environment that would cause deterioration of dry cracking and salt enrichment on the relics surface [30,31]. Luo et al. [32] proposed the use of primitive soil parameters as control parameters and by adjusting the environmental parameters of the air so as to be consistent with the soil parameters in order to achieve a balance between different environments; and 2) most of the site museum exhibition halls have a spacious, open-plan architectural layout (Fig. 1a). As a result, the preservation area typically accounts for only about 30% of the total exhibition hall area, with most of the energy consumption being wasted in the non-occupied area [20]. Local environmental control for the preservation area in the open large space of the exhibition hall has proven to be an effective way to reduce energy consumption and meet the unique environmental requirements of relics. Luo et al. [20,32,33] suggest that the localized preservation area can be independently controlled using a displacement ventilation system [20], a capillary radiation cooling system [32] or an air curtain system [33]. Moreover, an evaporative cooling system has been proposed to replace traditional electricity-driven refrigeration equipment, further reducing energy consumption [34]. Generally speaking, local heating of the relics\u2019 preservation area in a large exhibition hall is a challenging task as warm air will rise and move out of the preservation area. Luo et al [35] argue that temperature inversion is a key factor in maintaining a stable local environment and by using a warm air curtain to cover the relics preservation area, the local heating of the funerary pit was complemented. Among the various available systems, displacement ventilation systems have a high potential application due to their efficacy in controlling the local environment in large public buildings [36,37]. In previous research, the current authors conducted an experimental study of local environmental control of cultural relics through displacement ventilation, however the research resulted in an imperfect RH control scheme, which could not meet the 100% RH requirement to stop the formation of desiccation cracks on cultural relics [31]. At the same time, the return air inlet of the system was arranged at the interface between the visitor\u2019s area and the relics and the return air would entrain some air from the visitor\u2019s area, thus the system still had the potential to further reduce energy consumption. Aiming for these gaps in the previous research, this study conducted an optimization study of the air supply parameters, as well as the layout of its inlets and return air inlets within the Emperor Qin\u2019s Mausoleum site-museum in order to further improve the stability of environmental control parameters and reduce overall operational energy consumption. This provided an optimal solution for the promotion and application of the displacement ventilation system in the museum. 2 Methods 2.1 Experimental exhibition hall and experimental system The ancient Chinese emperors wanted to live as luxurious as possible before they died. As such, they built massive mausoleums containing abundant funerary objects. The Emperor Qin\u2019s Mausoleum (259\u2013210BCE) is one of the most famous mausoleums in the world. Since 1979, some funerary pit sites have been preserved and opened to the public with the construction of a site museum, following after which they were included in the World Cultural Heritage List in 1987. So far, they have received more than 100 million visitors. These relics were buried in a stable underground environment and well-preserved for over two thousand years, before being unearthed. Since they were unearthed, some unearthed relics remain partially embedded in their primitive matrix, while others have been exposed to the prevailing air conditions in the site exhibition hall (Fig. 1b). Various signs of deterioration, such as salt enrichment, fading, and desiccation cracking, have occurred due to the combined effects of improper environmental conservation, climate change, and water and solute transfer [38,39]. Preventive conservation through a dedicated environmental control strategy is urgently needed. With the support of the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and the National Cultural Heritage Administration, a large experimental exhibition hall was built on the campus of Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, which is located about 37 km away from the Emperor Qin\u2019s Mausoleum. Climatic conditions and soil environment are similar to those found in the Emperor Qin\u2019s Mausoleum. A funerary pit was excavated in the exhibition hall to simulate the relic preservation area. The height of the experimental exhibition hall was 6 m. The length, width and depth of the simulation funerary pit were 4.0 m, 2.8 m and 2.0 m, respectively. Both the geometrical structure and the accompanying parameters are similar to those of the exhibition hall of the Emperor Qin\u2019s Mausoleum (Fig. 2 ). The flow chart for the environmental control system and photographs of the experimental exhibition hall are shown in Fig. 3 . The air supply plenum chamber of the displacement ventilation is placed at the bottom of a square funerary pit, while the return air inlet is arranged on the upper part of the opposite wall of the air supply outlet, making the piston flow area of bottom supply and top return and covering the entire preservation area. The length, width and height of the air supply plenum chamber are 2.4 m, 0.2 m and 0.7 m, respectively. The opening rate of the orifice plate air supply outlet is 25%, with an air supply micro-hole diameter of 2 mm. The system used an air source heat pump as the source of both cold and heat. Compared to previous research [20], the following improvements have been made to the current experimental system: 1) an ultrasonic humidification unit has been added to the end of the air supply to maintain 100% RH in the supplied air and thus curb the occurrence of desiccation cracking and surface salt enrichment of the relics; and 2) the air supply outlet is moved down from the interface between the funerary pit and the visitor area to a position inside the funerary pit. During the experiment, the temperature and RH of the exhibition hall were measured and analyzed. The layout of sensors is shown in Fig. 3a. Distribution of measuring points and sensor parameters are shown in Table 1 . Air velocity has a significant impact on desiccation cracking of earthen sites and should be less than 0.15 m/s [40]. In this study, an orifice plate with area of 1.75 m2 was used as an air supply outlet to reduce the air velocity. As measured in previous studies [20], the average air velocity in the preservation area is less than the recommended lower limit value of the Swema 03 air velocity sensor (0.07 m/s). 2.2 Experimental conditions Since the temperature of the visitor area is always higher than the temperature of the preservation area, and the local environment in the funerary pit can be controlled independently of the visitor area [8], the visitor area was maintained in a state of natural ventilation without environmental control during the experimental period. Three experimental tests were performed by changing the installation height of the return air outlet, as shown in Table 2 . Each test had a continuous operating time of 42 h and was then switched to the next operating condition. There is a pre-transition stage of at least 6 h between two experimental tests. For cases 1\u20133, the height of the return air inlet above the ground (H in Fig. 3a) is 1.6 m, 0.9 m and 0.4 m, respectively. As in the previous study [20], the air change rate and air supply temperature were set at 11.9 times/hour and 20 °C, respectively. Finally, the RH of the supplied air was increased to 100% for minimizing the desiccation cracking of relics. 2.3 Numerical simulation Displacement ventilation systems can effectively control the airflow in localized indoor settings by forming a piston flow between the air supply outlet and the return air inlet, so that the air supply outlet is usually located at the bottom of the room. However, when the system is applied on a large area such as the exhibition hall of a site-museum, the arrangement of the air supply outlet requires reconsideration, because the ground surface of the preservation area is usually an earthen site in nature, which is not suitable for positioning the air outlet. Moreover, when the temperature of the supplied air equals the temperature of the earthen site surface, there will be no significant internal heat source within the preservation area since there are no people or equipment within this area to generate it. Therefore, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) were used to further clarify the impact of the position of the air supply outlet and the temperature of the supply air on the system performance. The governing equation of the variants to be solved can be written as follows: [41] (1) ∂ ρ ϕ ∂ t ⏟ Transient t e r m + d i v ρ U ϕ ⏟ Convection t e r m = d i v Γ ϕ g r a d ϕ ⏟ Diffusion t e r m + S ϕ ⏟ SourceTerm where, ϕ denotes the general variable of velocity, temperature, concentration (RH), and turbulent kinetic energy; Γ ϕ and S ϕ denote the generalized diffusion coefficient and source term, respectively. The finite volume method was adopted to discretize the governing equation. The discretization schemes of the implicit Euler, the second-order upwind difference and the central difference are used for the transient term, convection term and the diffusion term of the governing equations, respectively. The governing equation was solved using the commercial software Fluent 17. SIMPLE algorithm for coupling pressure and velocity was adopted, and a standard k - ε two-equation turbulence model was adopted for the turbulence model. 2.4 Simulation cases and boundary conditions By changing the arrangement of the air supply outlet and the soil temperature of the funerary pits, five cases were simulated in this study (Table 3 ). C1-C3 indicate the scenarios in which the position of the air supply outlet was changed. In scenarios C4 and C5, the soil temperature at the bottom of the pit was an independent variable. In all conditions, the height of the return air inlet was 1.6 m above the ground, and the air change rate was 11.9 times/hour, which is the same as in experimental case 1 (Table 2). The remaining parameters are as follows: \u2022 Case C1: The soil temperature and the air supply temperature are maintained at 20 ℃, with the air supply outlet placed on the ground of the funerary pit, and the air supply outlet height is equal to 0.7 m; \u2022 Case C2: The air supply outlet and the installation height are set to h/2 (0.35 m). All other parameters remained unchanged from C1; \u2022 Case C3: The air supply outlet is installed close to the ground and all other parameters remain unchanged from C2; \u2022 Case C4: Unlike C1, the soil temperature at the bottom of the funerary pit is set to 10 °C, which is lower than the air supply temperature of 20 °C. This is a scenario in which the soil at the bottom of the funerary pit acts as a source of cold, for example when the air supply temperature is higher than the soil temperature; and \u2022 Case C5: The soil temperature at the bottom of the funerary pit is set to 30 °C, which is higher than the air supply temperature of 20 °C. This is a scenario in which the heat source is located at the bottom of the funerary pit. All boundary conditions, except for the soil temperature at the bottom of the funerary pit under C4 and C5, were set as mean measured data from 12:00 (noon) to 1:00 PM during the experiment. It should be noted that the temperature conditions for the envelope of the visitor area are given according to experimental data measured by an infrared thermometer, while the RH boundary conditions are assumed to be zero flux, as shown in Table 4 . 2.5 Computational mesh A structured grid for spatial discretization of the calculation area has been adopted. At the same time, the funerary pit, especially the area near the air supply outlets and return air inlets, is locally encrypted to improve the calculation accuracy. Five schemes with numbered grid divisions of 728,191, 1,563,620, 2,802,944, 4,543,170, and 6,218,652 were selected to validate grid independence (Fig. 4 ). The results show that the relative calculation error was less than 2% between the grids of 4,543,170 and 6,218,652 divisions. The calculation result was basically independent of the grid when the grid was 4,543,170, which could satisfy the calculation precision. Since the air supply outlets and return air inlets were symmetrically arranged on either side of the funerary pit, the y-x transect in its center (see Fig. 4a) was selected as a representative area with the recorded temperature, RH and air velocity distribution characteristics of the calculation area under different calculation conditions. 3 Experimental results and discussion 3.1 Temperature and RH Most of the exhibition halls of the Emperor Qin\u2019s Mausoleum Site Museum rely primarily on natural ventilation without installing additional HVAC systems. As such, the indoor temperature and RH are significantly affected by outdoor climatic conditions. For example, the temperature and RH in the preservation area of the No. 1 exhibition hall can show short-term oscillations of as much as 10.5 °C and 24%, respectively [38,39]. In fact, for all three experimental cases, the maximum outdoor temperature exceeded 40.0 ℃, with short-term temperature fluctuations greater than 13.0 ℃, and the RH fluctuations greater than 36% (Table 5 ). This hot and volatile outdoor environment threatens to accelerate the deterioration of the indoor artifacts and underscores the need to create a \u201cclean and stable\u201d preservation environment. Fig. 5 a-c shows the temporal variation of temperature at T1-T10 in experimental cases 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Fig. 5d shows the average temperature of measuring points T1-T10. As the visitor area was under natural ventilation for each test case, the temperature at T10 was greatly influenced by the outdoor environment and showed significant diurnal fluctuations greater than 11.0 °C. The local environmental control system does not significantly affect the areas of visitors, and the mean temperature at T10 for cases 1\u20133 is 30.5 ℃, 29.3 ℃, and 29.4 ℃, respectively, which is close to those values in the outdoor environment (Table 5). The measuring points T1-T9 are all arranged in the funerary pit, and their temperature fluctuations increase with increasing the height of the sensor (Fig. 3a). The reason is that the cold air lake created by displaced ventilation is located in the lower part of the funerary pit. In all three test cases, the temperature of the preservation area (T1-T3) remained relatively stable, especially the area closest to the earthen site (T1) with a mean temperature of 20.9 ℃ and a short-term fluctuation of less than 2 ℃. Thus, the mean temperature is approximately equal to the temperature of the supplied air, which indicates that the preservation environment is undisturbed by the soil at the bottom of the pit and that the soil and air in the relics\u2019 environment have basically reached a balance. The size of the unearthed relics varies greatly from one funerary pit to another, which requires adjusting the height of the air-conditioned area in order to save energy. As shown in Fig. 5d, two transitions are observed in the vertical profiles of the mean temperature, with the lower turning point for cases 1\u20133 occurring at 0.7 m, 0.5 m, and 0.2 m, respectively. The environmental temperature below the first turning point is essentially the same, probably providing a constant preservation environment for the relics within this height. The upper threshold of the environmental stability zone within the preservation area is significantly affected by the location of the return air outlet, whereby the height of the trapped cool air in the base decreases with a concordant decrease in the height of the return air outlet. The second turning point follows a similar pattern, appears between T7 and T8 and corresponds to a height of 1.6\u20131.7 m. This turning point represents the interface between the visitor area and the funerary pit area and is mainly affected by the temperature of the visitor environment. Fig. 6 a-c shows the distribution of RH at T1-T10 in experiments 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Fig. 6d shows the average RH of T1-T10. The RH variation is basically similar to that of temperature. Due to the addition of an ultrasonic humidification unit and the accompanying increase in RH of the supplied air, the entire environment in the funerary pit maintained the high RH state, and even RH at T1 maintained a constant value of 100%. This compares favorably with a diurnal RH fluctuation of 27% for T1 obtained in our previous research [13], probably meeting the control target of suppressing desiccation cracking in relics. 3.2 Temperature of the soil-air interface Most of the unearthed relics in the Emperor Qin\u2019s Mausoleum Museum have been preserved in a soil-air coupling environment. The difference in temperature between the soil and the air at their contact is an important driving force for water and salt migration, which further leads to the deterioration of the earthen sites. Fig. 7 shows the temporal variation in temperature at the measuring sensor Ts distributed in the soil and T1 that is placed above the bottom of the pit. Although the lower return air outlet reduces the air-conditioned area, it does not significantly affect the balance between the soil and the air environment within the preservation area. With values of 0.27 ℃, 0.20 ℃, and 0.20 ℃, respectively, the average temperature difference between soil and air ( Δ T = T 1 - T s ) is practically the same in all three conditions. For comparison, when the environmental control system is turned off and the preservation environment is returned to its natural ventilation state, the temperature difference Δ T is much higher and reaches 2.1 ℃ [20]. A more balanced soil-to-air environment that is achieved by using a displacement system could effectively delay the occurrence of desiccation cracking and salt enrichment. 3.3 Energy consumption In all experimental tests, only the relics preservation environment is locally controlled, and the visitors\u2019 environment is still not air-conditioned, so that the total air supply volume is very small and the ratio of heat losses of the duct to the total load is very high. To exclude the effect of heat loss due to duct, the actual utilized energy consumed is used to evaluate the performance of the system with the application of the following equation: (2) Q = L m h r - h s = L m Δ h where, L m , h r , h s denote the mass flow of the supplied air, the air-specific enthalpy of the return air and the supplied air, respectively. The air specific enthalpy was obtained according to the temperature and humidity of the air supply outlets and the return air inlets measured in the experiment. Table 6 shows the actual utilized energy consumption of the system in the three experimental cases. For comparison, the table also lists the actual utilized energy consumption used for the experiment conducted in [19], when the return air outlet was placed at the interface between the visitor area and the funerary pit (Fig. 8 a). It is obvious that the actual utilized energy consumption of the system decreased when the return air outlet was positioned lower. This is because as the position of the return air inlet decreases in height, the volume of the air-conditioned areas also decreases. Compared to the previous study [20], in which the actual utilized energy consumption per unit area was 124.7 W/m2, (Fig. 8a), the actual utilized energy consumption per unit area of cases 1\u20133 in the current study was reduced by 47.7%, 58.2%, and 65.9%, respectively. This is mainly due to the relocation of the return air inlet away from the interface between the visitor area and the funerary pit into the relics preservation, thus reducing the entrainment of warm air from the visitors\u2019 area. This indicates that the position of the return air inlet is crucial for reducing the energy consumption in the experimental system. 4 Numerical simulation results and discussion 4.1 Model validation The numerical mode is validated by comparing the results of the experimental data of test case 1 with the results of simulation case C1. Fig. 9 compares the measured and simulated temperature and RH at T1-T10 for test case 1. The simulated temperature and RH within the vertical transect of the space show the same trends of variation as the experimental test, both forming stable thermal stratification. From T1 to T10, the relative temperature errors between the experimental and simulated data are 3.6%, 4.1%, 4.4%, 10%, 14.0%, 13.5%, 16.1%, 14.5%, 4.1% and 3.3%, respectively. The average relative temperature error is 8.8%. The relative errors of RH from T1 to T10 are 8.8%, 8.5%, 7.2%, 3.4%, 2.7%, 1.3%, 10%, 2.5%, 6.7% and 4.5%, respectively, with an average relative RH error of 7.0%. In general, a good agreement was obtained between the experimental results and the numerical simulation results. It is worth noting that there are significant differences in simulated and experimental results for the internal funerary pit area, and the differences are mainly attributed to the following factors: 1) The ultrasonic humidifier was turned on during the experiment, which means that the supplied air carried a certain amount of water mist that would evaporate in the relic preservation area, thus raising RH. Evaporation of water mist is not considered in the simulated model; and 2) Air and heat exchange through windows during the test is also not taken into account in the calculations. 4.2 The impact of the air supply outlet height on environmental control The contour map and air velocity streamlines in the funerary pit for cases C1-C3 are shown in Fig. 10 . Although less affected by gravity and set to the same temperature as the soil of the funerary pit, the supplied air continued to flow downwards and near the ground surface after leaving the supplied air inlet. This is because the air supply to the funerary pit is a jet in a confined space and as such entrains a smaller air volume at ground level, which causes the air supply to flow downwards. Therefore, the flow pattern of the air supply at the bottom of the funerary pit was basically the same under all three calculation conditions. It should be noted that the air supply outlet area of C2 and C3 was only half the area of C1, which means that C2 and C3 experienced a higher air supply velocity. C3 showed a \u201chigh-velocity\u201d spot in front of the outlet where the sinking air reached the ground, which probably resulted in disturbances in the earthen site. In C2, the \u201chigh-velocity\u201d spot is not obvious due to the air supply outlet located at a height of 0.35 m above the ground, and the air velocity declines quickly after leaving the air outlet. Generally speaking, when the soil in the preservation area is also an earthen site and direct distribution of air outlets on the ground is not allowed, the arrangement of air supply outlets at a certain height above the ground does not affect the airflow organization of the air supply. Contour maps for temperature and RH of the central transect (Fig. 4) are shown in Figs. 11 and 12 , respectively. In all three cases, a \u201ccold lake\u201d is formed within the lower 1.1 m of funerary pits, with a sustained temperature between 20 and 21 ℃. The temperature of this \u201cbasal pool\u201d is uniform and stable, possibly satisfying the preservation criteria for the unearthed relics. The RH in the preservation area is not as stable as the temperature, as it is greater than 95% within the area near the air supply inlet, but only 90% within the area near the return air outlet. Since this difference was greater than 5%, an additional ultrasonic humidification unit was used in the experimental system to provide uniform and saturated RH within the preservation area. In general, under all three conditions, the characteristics of distribution and the range of variations in temperature and RH in the funerary pit are almost identical, which indicates that changing the position of the air supply outlet has almost no impact on the preservation environment. Moreover, the temperature and RH distribution profiles for the central vertical transect of the simulated models match well and even overlap to a large extent, further showing that changing the position of the air supply outlet had almost no effect on environmental control (Fig. 13 ). 4.3 Influence of soil temperature The contour map and streamlines of the air velocity in the funerary pit for cases C4, C1 and C5 are shown in Fig. 14 . For C4 and C1, the temperature of the ground surface was either lower than (C4) or equal to (C1) that of the supplied air. As the ground was neither a heat source nor a buoyant force, the increase in airflow was therefore weaker than that of C5, with the ground surface temperature being higher than the supply air temperature. In the latter case, the heating effect caused by the higher ground surface temperature promoted an increase in air flow, which led to the air supply jet entraining more air to compensate for the upward flow. This promoted a downward trend of the air supply at the outlet stage, showing that the wind velocity in the lower part of the air supply outlet was significantly higher than in conditions 1 and 4. The contour maps of temperature and RH in the central section of the exhibition hall for C4, C1 and C5 are shown in Figs. 15 and 16 , respectively. Although temperature distributions within the preservation area form similarly stable \u201cbottom-cold and top-warm\u201d thermal stratification structures in all three cases, the causes of thermal stratifications show some differences. In C4 and C1, the air supply temperature is lower than or equal to the soil temperature at the bottom of the pit, without the internal heat disturbance rising from the latter. In C5, the ground temperature in the preservation area is higher than the air supply temperature, forming an internal heat source and causing local disturbances in air flow. However, the temperature in the visitor area in the upper part of the funerary pit is as high as 37 °C, which is still much higher than the ground temperature, so the preservation area is still a relatively low temperature area compared to the visitor area and could possibly maintain a cooler \u201cbasal pool\u201d. Temperature and RH profiles along the horizontal jet direction at a height of 0.35 m are shown in Fig. 17 . For C4, under the cooling effect of the ground and with a temperature of 10 °C, the supply air temperature shows a downward trend after leaving the air outlet, reaching a stable status at 18 °C within 0.4 m from the air supply outlet. In contrast, under the same conditions, the RH maintained a uniform and stable distribution along the horizontal profile, with a saturation state of RH = 100. For C1, the supply air temperature remained practically unchanged, with only a small increase of 0.4 ℃ after leaving the outlet. In this case, the RH decreased slightly along the horizontal flow, dropping from 100% near the air supply outlet to about 95% on the return air side. Due to the heat source from the ground, the supplied air in C5 showed a rapid upward trend along the horizontal flow, with a temperature increase of more than 4 ℃. Moreover, the RH shows a corresponding decrease of 30%. In general, when the air supply temperature was higher or lower than the ground temperature, the heating or cooling effect caused a disturbance that resulted in an imbalance in the coupled soil-air preservation environment. Conversely, when the air supply temperature is equal to the ground temperature of the funerary pit, the balance between these different matrices can be better achieved and the spatial distribution of environmental parameters can be kept relatively stable. 5 Conclusions In response to the local preservation environment control for the unearthed relics in Emperor Qin\u2019s Mausoleum Museum, the advantages of using the displacement ventilation system to improve the local preservation environment were explored. The following results were obtained: (1) In the case when the system operates in the isothermal air supply mode, i.e., the temperature of the supplied air is equal to the ground temperature of the preservation area, the displacement ventilation system achieves an efficient and stable local environment within the preservation area of the exhibition hall. The temperature difference is reduced from 2.1 ℃ under natural ventilation to less than 0.3 ℃ when the displacement ventilation system is operating, achieving an effective equilibrium of the soil-air preservation environment. (2) The height of the return air inlet has a measurable impact on the thermal stratification of the local preservation environment. When lowered, the upper threshold of a stable air-conditioned area undergoes a corresponding reduction, with a similar reduction in energy consumption. Compared to previous research [20], energy savings of 47.7\u201365.9% could be achieved by reducing the return air outlet height. Optimizing the layout of the return air outlet according to the actual height of the relics has an important energy-saving potential. (3) The relationship between the air supply temperature and the ground temperature in the preservation area is an important factor influencing environmental control. As the air supply flow at the bottom of the preservation area represents the characteristics of the ground-related flow, changing the position of the air supply outlet at the bottom of the relics preservation area does not affect the system performance in the local environment. Adjusting the air supply temperature to match the ground temperature of the preservation area effectively reduces the disturbance generated by the ambient cold/heat ground to the overall environment and improves the stability of the preservation area while balancing the soil-air thermal exchange. The proposed methods can be extended to other site museums. Since the present study did not consider the operation mode of local heating in winter and the impact of heat gains (occupants, lighting) on the preservation environment, further work will consider the year-round operation mode and the influence of the visitors\u2019 environments.

        "dc:description": "Displacement ventilation system is a proven way to save energy by controlling the local preservation environment for the unearthed relics in site museums. In this study, the influences of air inlet/outlet arrangement as well as the earthen site temperature on the performance of the local environment control system were investigated. The results demonstrate that, in addition to achieving a significant reduction in energy consumption, the displacement ventilation system can also achieve local environmental control within the preservation area of a large exhibition hall, while establishing an equilibrium of the soil-air environment. Moreover, by reducing the height of the return air inlet and the effective height of the environmental control area, energy savings of 47.7\u201365.9% can be achieved. Moving the position of the air supply outlet to the bottom of the pit has little effect on overall environmental control, while adjusting the air supply temperature to match that of the soil at the bottom of the relic preservation area can effectively reduce environmental disturbance, achieving uniformity and environmental stability. These research results provide not only an effective solution for local environmental control of the relics in site museums, but also a basis for the functioning of the displacement ventilation system within the site exhibition hall.",
