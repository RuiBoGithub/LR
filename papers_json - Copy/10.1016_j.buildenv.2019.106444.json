In multi-zone variable outdoor air (OA) volume air-conditioning systems, there is often a mismatch between OA volume flow supply and demand, because variable air volume (VAV) systems exhibit nonlinear, multivariable, and long delay characteristics. Traditional methods ensure indoor air quality (IAQ) by increasing OA volume flow, which leads to a waste of OA flow energy. To address this problem, an optimal control method for determining discrete variable OA volume flow setpoints, based on differential pressure control, is proposed in this study. In this method, changes in indoor CO2 concentration and the total air volume flow demand of terminals are regarded as constraints of OA volume flow setpoints. A Proportional-Integral (PI) calculation method and trial-and-error method are used to discretize continuous OA volume flow setpoints to increase system stability. Two types of experiments were conducted to compare the characteristics of the two discrete OA volume flow setpoint determining methods, and to verify the feasibility of our new approach. The results show that the OA volume flow control loop can be well fitted with other control loops of VAV systems, and ensure OA volume flow demand for a target area. The proposed method provides greater energy savings than maximum OA ratio control strategy (7%\u201322%) and typical on-demand ventilation method (6.1%), and better control performance than continuous OA volume flow setpoints control system. The PI calculation method is suitable for conditions with high IAQ requirements, while the trial-and-error method can be used for comfort air-conditioning systems to adjust the indoor environment. Keywords VAV system Discrete variable OA volume flow setpoints PI calculation method Trial-and-error method Energy saving 1 Introduction It is reported that most people spend 90% of their time indoors. Consequently, research on indoor air quality (IAQ) is a trending topic because of its effect on people's working mood and efficiency [1,2]. While heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems can effectively improve IAQ by supplying fresh air from outdoors, they also increase the energy consumption of buildings. According to simulation studies and investigations, it is estimated that the energy consumption of HVAC systems accounts for 40% of the total energy consumption of a building [3]. Variable air volume (VAV) systems account for more than 30% [4] of the energy consumption of HVAC systems, and are one of the key strategies to saving energy. VAV systems are widely used in public buildings because of their advantageous features: creating a good indoor environment, flexible control, and energy savings [5,6]. Accordingly, controlling outdoor air (OA) volume flow is the key to ensuring IAQ to meet these demands. An actual VAV system is a complex system with nonlinear, multivariable, and long delay time characteristics. There are many control loops interacting with each other and leading to unreasonable distribution of OA volume flow in different regions [7\u20139]. Therefore, reducing OA flow load while ensuring OA flow supply in different regions is necessary to control OA volume flow. Controlling OA volume flow in a VAV system mainly includes two aspects \u2013 controlling and determination of OA volume flow. There are many OA volume flow control methods; among these, the differential pressure control method is widely used because of its stable control and strong applicability [10\u201313]. Traditional methods of determining OA volume flow according to design specifications often lead to high OA volume flow setpoints, which leads to a waste of OA flow energy. It has been suggested that choosing the method for OA volume flow setpoint determination according to the real-time requirements of a target area is an energy-efficient process. A number of studies have been conducted to determine which indicator can accurately reflect the real-time requirements of given target areas. CO2 is the main pollutant produced by people indoors [14\u201316]. Therefore, on-demand ventilation using indoor CO2 concentration as a monitoring and evaluation index has become a popular control strategy, and remarkable progress has been achieved in this area. These studies also prove that on-demand ventilation control can meet IAQ requirements and result in energy savings [17\u201321]. In fact, in addition to producing CO2, people also have an impact on the load of the target area. Considering the uneven load distribution generated due to changes in the number and distribution of users in different spaces, some scholars have introduced the concept of occupancy rate (actual use rate of a controlled area) to optimize the control method. In addition, they have combined an indoor positioning system with a VAV system to optimize indoor ventilation rate. The results show that these proposed methods can lead to energy savings [22\u201326]. In a VAV system, adjusting terminal devices has a direct impact on the IAQ. In 2014, Zhang et al. proved that the air volume setpoint of terminals in a VAV system has a significant impact on the energy consumption of a building [27]. In the same year, Kang et al. studied the operation mode of VAV systems and reported that the minimum air flow rate of a VAV terminal device is the key parameter affecting thermal comfort, IAQ, and energy consumption [28]. Based on Kang's theory, many control methods have been proposed for minimum air flow from terminal devices and these methods have been found to be more energy efficient than existing control methods [29\u201331]. Existing methods, whether they are based on on-demand ventilation control of indoor CO2 concentration, regulating airflow from terminal devices, or optimizing ventilation rate control according to indoor occupancy rate, essentially adjust OA volume flow setpoints to meet IAQ requirements. Previous studies have indirectly confirmed that variable setpoints of OA volume flow are beneficial for reducing energy consumption. Meanwhile, there have only been a few studies on direct OA volume flow control from the perspective of OA volume flow setpoints. Xu et al. [32] and Wang et al. [33] optimize the total outdoor air flow rate by compromising the thermal comfort, indoor air quality and total energy consumption and appropriate control strategy is proposed to realize the control of outdoor air flow rate. Sun et al. present a model-based outdoor air flow rate optimal control strategy and adopted an adaptive optimization algorithm to optimize the set-point of the outdoor air flow rate to reduce the energy cost [34]. For multi-zone air-conditioning systems, appropriate OA flow setpoint, short response times, and system stability are important factors for real application. Therefore, in this study, an optimal control method based on differential pressure control for the determination of discrete variable OA volume flow setpoints in VAV systems is proposed, aiming at solving the problem of mismatch between OA volume flow supply and demand, meeting the requirements of IAQ, improving control system stability via decrease the regulation time of air dampers as well as energy saving effect. 2 Proposed optimal control method The optimal control method proposed in this study consists of two aspects: a differential pressure control method, and a method for determining discrete variable OA volume flow setpoints. 2.1 Principle of the differential pressure control method The typical cascade control loop of OA volume flow is shown in Fig. 1 . In this cascade control loop, the outer control loop is to determine the OA volume flow setpoint by specific algorithm to calculate the OA volume flow setpoint using the difference of the setpoint value and the monitoring value of indoor CO2 concentration. In the inner control loop, the OA volume flow can be controlled at its setpoint according to appropriate strategies using the monitoring value of OA volume flow. However, due to the cost of sensor of air volume flow is relatively expensive and its measurement error sometimes cannot satisfy the control performance because of the installation space limitation. Therefore, we adopt the differential pressure control method that can convert the measurement of air volume into the measurement of differential pressure, which has wide application in real project. The cascade control loop of the differential pressure method is shown in Fig. 2 . In this improved cascade control loop, the outer control loop is to calculate the OA volume flow setpoint by the proposed methods according to the difference of the set and the monitoring values of indoor CO2 concentration, which will be introduced in 2.2 and 2.3. In the inner control loop, the differential pressure control method is used to realize the control of OA volume flow, and the differential pressure of OA damper can be determined when the OA volume flow setpoint and the position of OA damper are determined, which is shown in Equation (1). ΔP represents differential pressure of damper, S represents impedance of damper and V represents air volume flow. (1) Δ P = S V 2 . The differential pressure of OA damper is regarded as input setpoint of the inner loop and adjust the position of the return air damper with the changes in the total air volume flow demand of terminals to make the differential pressure of the OA damper at its setpoint. 2.2 Determine the variable outdoor air volume flow setpoint Based on the differential pressure control method, when the position of the OA damper is determined, the differential pressure of the OA damper varies with changes in OA volume flow and it is vital to determine the appropriate setpoints of OA volume flow to guarantee OA volume flow demand and maximize energy savings. The determination of the variable outdoor air volume flow setpoint is also the key point of proposed method in this paper. In this method, changes in indoor CO2 concentration and the total air volume flow demand of terminals are regarded as constraints of OA volume flow setpoint. First, the OA volume flow setpoint range is determined as [V OAsmin, V OAsmax], where V OAsmin is the minimum setpoint of OA volume flow and V OAsmax is the maximum setpoint. In this range, real-time CO2 concentration reflects changes in the number of people indoors and OA volume flow setpoints are based on the feedback of CO2 concentration. But there are exceptions for certain situations, for example, for a place with a large area and high people mobility, when the number of people indoors is reduced to a certain extent, the most intuitive reflection is the reduction of cooling or heating load, which reduces the total demand of air volume flow of terminals. It takes a certain time period for CO2 to spread uniformly because of the large area, small number of people, and higher dispersion of people indoors. At this time, the measured CO2 concentration cannot reflect changes in the number of people indoors in time. Therefore, it is necessary to revise the setpoints of OA volume flow according to the total air volume flow demand of terminals to select a smaller OA volume flow setpoint that meets the requirements. In this scenario, CO2 concentration indoors is no longer regarded as the only criterion to determine OA volume flow setpoints. 2.3 Method for determining discrete variable OA volume flow setpoints According to the principle of the differential pressure control method, if a OA volume flow setpoint changes continuously, the actuator needs to operate continuously to control the volume flow, thus leading to system instability. in the outer control, the position of the OA damper should be adjusted if the indoor OA volume flow demand changes continuously. In the inner control loop, the position of the return air damper should be adjusted with respect to changes in the differential pressure setpoint of the OA damper. Moreover, frequent changes in the OA control system conditions can affect the operation of other control loops in a VAV system, because the OA volume flow control system is coupled with the entire system. Therefore, the idea of discretizing OA volume flow setpoints is proposed in this study to realize variable OA volume flow setpoint control by determining the initial position and differential pressure setpoint of the OA damper of each OA volume flow setpoint. There are PI calculation method and trial-and-error method, which are adopted to determine discrete OA volume flow setpoints. For the PI calculation method, real-time CO2 concentration is measured using a CO2 sensor installed in the return air duct and deviation is evaluated by comparing the measured and set CO2 concentrations. Then, deviation was calculated using the PI algorithm to obtain PI (C CO2 ). Finally, the setpoint of OA volume flow, V OAs, was obtained from Equation (2). (2) V OAs = V OAsmax − ( V OAsmax − V OAsmin ) 100 P I ( C CO 2 ) The setpoints of OA volume flow obtained from Equation (2) change continuously and they should be divided into several grades within the desired range to realize discretization. If the setpoint of OA volume flow calculated by Equation (2) is between two grades, the higher level grade is considered as the setpoint. A schematic diagram of the discrete method used for PI calculation is shown in Fig. 3 . When PI (C CO2 )\u202f=\u202f100, the setpoint of OA volume flow is V OAsmin (the minimum of OA volume flow) and when PI (C CO2 )\u202f=\u202f0, the setpoint is V OAsmax. OA setpoint grades range from V OAsmin to V OAs1 and finally to V OAsmax; at this point, PI (C CO2 ) can be calculated according to the setpoints of these grades. When CO2 concentration is higher than the CO2 setpoint, PI (C CO2 ) decreases from 100 to 0. The procedure for the trial-and-error method is relatively simpler compared to that of the PI calculation method. A fixed range of CO2 concentrations, [C CO2low, C CO2high], is defined as the target concentration range to judge whether the OA volume flow setpoint changes or not. If the CO2 concentration of a room (or return air duct) is higher than the upper limit of the CO2 concentration range, OA volume flow setpoint is increased with a fixed step size and if it is lower than the lower limit of the CO2 concentration range, the setpoint is reduced with a fixed step size. A time delay period is set after changing the OA volume flow setpoint to determine whether it needs to be changed again or not. Step size is defined as the difference between two adjacent OA volume flow grades and OA volume flow grades and step size can be determined easily by users. The control principle is shown in Fig. 4 . The principle of the proposed control method lies in determining the setpoint grades of OA volume flow according to changes in the indoor (or return air duct) CO2 concentration and total air volume flow demand of terminals, V TDs, after which the initial position and differential pressure setpoint of the OA damper at each grade are determined. Finally, the opening of the OA damper is kept unchanged at each OA volume flow setpoint and the PI algorithm is used to adjust the return air damper to maintain the measured differential pressure of the OA damper at its setpoint. The operation flow is illustrated in Fig. 5 . 3 Experimental study and implementation of the proposed method 3.1 System description Experiments were conducted on an integrated control test rig for a VAV system built at the Institute of Building Energy, Dalian University of Technology. The test-bed serves a postgraduate office, whose air-conditioning area was 100\u202fm2 and net height of the building was 3.3\u202fm; the characteristics of this office are as follows. (1) The total heating load, lighting load, equipment load are 4283\u202fW, 900\u202fW and 5000\u202fW (utilization rate is 100%), respectively, which puts high requirement on indoor thermal environment. (2) The air-conditioning area is large, with an uncertain number and distribution of people with maximum is 50 and minimum is 5, which puts high requirement on IAQ and adjustment flexibility of OA volume flow control. (3) The indoor temperature is designed as 20\u202f°C The system includes complete VAV system equipment, sensors, actuators, and an automatic control system. The main equipment is listed in Table 1 . The control system of the test platform uses a direct digital controller (DDC) and the control software was CARE10.01LNS. Point-to-point connections between sensors, actuators, and controllers constitute a distributed system, which is arranged as shown in Fig. 6 . Control strategies for each of the control loops are as follows. C1: Indoor temperature control loop: Pressure-independent terminal control was employed and the indoor temperature was considered as the main control variable, while air supply from terminals was the auxiliary control variable [35]. Deviation was evaluated by comparing the measured and set indoor temperatures; subsequently, PI (T i) was calculated using the deviation in the PI algorithm. Finally, the OA volume setpoint V ABs was obtained using Equation (3). (3) V VBs = V VBsmax − ( V VBsmax − V VBsmin ) 100 P I ( T i ) where V VBs is the air volume flow setpoint of VAV BOX (m³/h), V VBsmax is the maximum design air volume flow of VAV BOX (m³/h), and V VBsmin is the minimum design air volume flow of VAV BOX (m³/h). Deviation was evaluated by comparing the measured and set values of VAV BOX and the PI algorithm was used to realize the adjustment required in terminal air dampers. C2: Air supply control loop: In 2014, Li et al. proposed a fuzzy control method based on maximum damper position feedback using the Mamdani-type fuzzy rule and functioning fuzzy subset inference (FFSI), their experimental results demonstrated the good energy-saving effect of this approach [36]. Therefore, we selected this method for application in the air supply control loop in the current investigation. C3: OA volume flow control loop: The differential pressure control method was used; its principle has been described in Section 2.2. C4: Supply air temperature control loop: A fixed supply air-temperature control method was adopted in this study. Deviation was evaluated by comparing the measured and set temperatures after which the PI algorithm was used to realize adjustments in the water valve. Water flow into the surface cooler can be controlled by controlling the opening of the water valve following which the temperature of air supply can be controlled. All control loops in the test-bed were integrated into the control system; the control program was edited using CARE software and the information of each loop was monitored and shared in real time. The main characteristics of the control points are shown in Table 2 . 3.2 Test scheme Air exchange rate for the test scheme was determined to be 5 times per hour [37] and the design minimum total air volume flow was empirically designed to be 55% of the maximum total air volume flow demand of the terminals. The total air volume flow demand of terminals ranged from 910 to 1650\u202fm3/h; it was then discretized into three grades of 910, 1280, and 1650\u202fm3/h. OA volume flow was obtained by calculating the difference between supply air volume flow and return air volume flow using CARE software. In China, the OA volume flow of office building needs to meet the requirement of indoor positive pressure which is usually 5\u201310\u202fPa [37,38]. In order to determine the OA volume flow setpoint which is meet the requirement of indoor positive pressure, Quadratic polynomial fitting of different OA volume flow values (m3/h) and indoor positive pressure values (Pa) yields the following equation. (4) V OA = − 2 . 05 P i 2 + 76 . 5 P i + 181.86 The minimum OA volume flow to meet indoor positive pressure requirements as calculated by Equation (4) was 450\u202fm3/h. The maximum OA volume flow is designed to be no more than 40% of the maximum total air volume flow demand of terminals (650\u202fm3/h). The OA volume flow setpoint range in this test was 450\u2013650\u202fm3/h. Subsequently, the OA volume flow was discretized into three grades: 450, 550, and 650\u202fm3/h. After observation and statistical analysis, it could be stated that there were 4\u20135 people in the air-conditioned area when the total air volume flow demand of terminals was at its lower limit; in this case, OA volume flow was determined to be 30\u202fm3/h per person [37]. Hence, the setpoint of OA volume flow corresponding to the lower limit of total air volume flow demand of terminals in this experiment was 150\u202fm3/h. The OA volume flow setpoint was optimized by changing the range of total air volume flow demand of terminals and the corresponding relationship is shown in Equation (5). (5) V OAs ∈ { { 450,550,650 } 1280 < V TDs ≤ 1650 { 450,550 } 910 < V TDs ≤ 1280 { 150 } V TDs ≤ 910 . where V OAs represents OA volume flow setpoints (m3/h) and V TDs is the total air volume flow demand of terminals (m3/h). The parameters P and I of the PI calculation method are 600 and 100, according to ASHRAE Standard 62 [9], when the indoor CO2 concentration is no more than 1000\u202fppm (1\u202fppm\u202f=\u202f1\u202fL/m). OA volume flow setpoints obtained by PI calculation are shown in Equations (6) and (7). (6) V OAs = { 650 0 ≤ P I ( CO 2 ) < 50 550 50 ≤ P I ( CO 2 ) < 100 450 P I ( CO 2 ) = 100 (7) V OAs = { 550 0 ≤ P I ( CO 2 ) < 100 450 P I ( CO 2 ) = 100 In these equations, V OAs are discrete variable OA volume flow setpoints calculated by the PI algorithm for different V TDs ranges (m3/h). The procedure for this calculation is illustrated in Fig. 7 . The ideal CO2 concentration range in the controlled area was set at 900\u20131100\u202fppm. The OA volume flow setpoint was then adjusted according to Equation (8), where V OAs is the current setpoint of OA volume flow (m3/h) and V OArs is the reset setpoint of OA volume flow (m3/h). The step size was set at 100\u202fm³/h and the adjustment period was 3\u202fmin. The trial-and-error method for discrete variable OA volume flow setpoint determination is shown in Fig. 8 . (8) V OArs = { V OAs + 100 C CO 2 > 1100 V OAs 900 ≤ C CO 2 ≤ 1100 V OAs − 100 C CO 2 < 900 In this paper, we combine the critical ratio method [39,40] and practical project experience to determine the PI control parameters, in other words, to determine the appropriate proportional band and integral action time. In the differential pressure control method, the P and I value of the regulating return air damper is - 150, 20. The P and I value of PI calculation method is 100, 16. The control parameters of discrete variable OA volume flow setpoints are shown in Table 3 . 4 Experimental study and implementation of the control method Three types of experiments were conducted in this study. The first experiment compares the results of PI calculation and trial-and-error methods, which is aimed at analyzing the characteristics of the two methods in determining discrete OA volume flow setpoints. The second experiment compares the proposed method and typical on-demand ventilation method, aiming at prove that the proposed method has better performance and energy saving. The third experiment is a feasibility analysis of the proposed method, which verifies the application effect of the proposed method. 4.1 Comparison between the PI calculation and trial-and-error methods In comparative experiments, all the influencing factors, except for comparative factors, should be kept similar to guarantee accuracy and reliability. (1) Discrete variable OA volume flow setpoints determined by the two methods are the same as shown in Table 3. (2) Two days with similar outdoor climatic conditions are selected for the experiment in order to ensure the same outdoor environment and similar disturbance in test results. (3) The number of people and indoor equipment are kept the same during different experimental periods in order to ensure the same indoor environment for the two methods. Further, CO2 is released artificially in order to simulate drastic changes in CO2 concentration indoors over a short period of time, the experimental scheme is as follows. (1) At the beginning of the test, indoor CO2 concentration is reduced to a level close to outdoor CO2 concentration by opening windows and doors; before starting the experiment, these doors and windows were closed. (2) The experiment lasted for 30\u202fmin. A flowmeter was used to control the release of CO2 (90\u202fL) in the laboratory during the first 10\u202fmin of the experiment. (3) The PI calculation and trial-and-error methods were tested when the total air volume flow demand of the terminals was 1650 and 1280\u202fm3/h, respectively. In this experiment, the two methods were compared in terms of four aspects \u2013 OA volume flow setpoint determination, IAQ, control effect of the OA volume flow and energy saving. In PI calculation method, appropriate P and I values should be determined to achieve a good OA setpoint optimal reset effect, which leads to complex operations. Meanwhile, the trial-and-error method is simpler and its step size can be set flexibly according to the actual needs of users to achieve a satisfactory control effect. The OA volume flow calculated when V TDs is 1650\u202fm³/h (Case 1) is plotted in Figs. 9 and 10 and in Figs. 11 and 12 when V TDs is 1280\u202fm³/h (Case 2); control indices corresponding to OA volume flow are shown in Table 4 . In the two cases, when indoor CO2 concentration changes during the test period, the OA volume flow setpoint changes quickly and the measured values of OA volume flow fluctuate around the setpoints. The average measured OA volume flow is greater than or equal to the setpoints and both the methods exhibit good control. At the end of the experiment, it can be observed that the final indoor CO2 concentration observed in the PI calculation method is less than that of the trial-and-error method in both cases. Both methods exhibit a positive deviation at the maximum OA volume flow of 650\u202fm³/h (Case 1) and 550\u202fm³/h (Case 2), but the time required for maintaining a positive deviation is longer in the PI calculation method. This shows that the PI calculation method can achieve better IAQ when the OA volume flow demand is high. The average set and measured OA volume flow values of the PI calculation method were 6.74% and 8.62%, respectively, for Case 1, and 2.01% and 6.83%, respectively, for Case 2; these are higher than those of the trial-and-error method for achieving the same control effect. Hence, it can be inferred that the trial-and-error method requires lesser OA volume and consumes less energy when compared to the PI calculation method. The control effect of OA volume flow is shown in Fig. 13 (V TDs\u202f=\u202f1650\u202fm³/h, Case 1) and Fig. 14 (V TDs\u202f=\u202f1280\u202fm³/h, Case 2); the control indices of differential pressure are shown in Table 5 . In Cases 1 and 2, the average relative deviation in differential pressure observed using the PI calculation method was 30.14% and 16.84% smaller, respectively, than the relative deviation obtained using the trial-and-error method. Further, the differential pressure control effect of the PI calculation method is better than that of the trial-and-error method, which indicates that the PI calculation method exhibits better stability. At present, in real project of China, maximum OA ratio control strategy are commonly used in multi-zone VAV system. The setpoints of OA volume flow in this strategy are 660\u202fm³/h (Case1) and 550\u202fm³/h (Case2), respectively. The results of energy saving calculation are shown in Table 6 . It can be concluded from Table 6 that the method proposed in this paper has better energy-saving potential than typical maximum OA ratio control strategy. 4.2 Comparison between the proposed method and typical on-demand ventilation method On-demand ventilation method, which uses indoor CO2 concentration as an evaluation index, and trial-and-error method are taken as examples of continuous and discrete OA volume setpoint to compare its system stability and energy saving. In the experiments, all the influencing factors, except for comparative factors, should be kept similar to guarantee accuracy and reliability. CO2 release and indoor temperature setpoint are used as control disturbances; the experimental scheme is as follows. (1) At the beginning of the test, indoor CO2 concentration was reduced to a level close to the outdoor CO2 concentration level by opening windows and doors; later, these doors and windows were closed prior to starting the experiment. (2) The experiment lasted for 30\u202fmin; a flowmeter was used to control the release of CO2 (180\u202fL) in the laboratory during the first 20\u202fmin of the experiment. (3) At the 30th minute, the terminal temperature setpoint was changed according to the rules shown in Table 7 . The position of OA damper and return air damper with continuous and discrete OA volume setpoint is shown as Fig. 15 , and the evaluating indicator is shown in Table 8 . The sampling period is 1s. It can be concluded from Table 8 that the change number of OA damper with discrete OA volume flow setpoint is obvious less than that of continuous volume flow setpoint, and the change number of return air damper are basically the same in two situations. The discrete method for OA volume flow setpoint determination improves the stability of OA volume flow control and has better energy saving with 6.1%. 4.3 Feasibility analysis of the proposed method It can be concluded from test results above that the trial-and-error method exhibits advantages of simple operation, flexible step size setting, quick response, and more energy savings; hence, it is used as an example to verify the feasibility and application effect of method proposed in this paper and the test scheme is the same as 4.2. The results of this experiment were analyzed from four perspectives: OA volume flow, control effect of supply air volume flow and OA volume flow, air volume flow of terminal BOX, and indoor positive pressure and supply air temperature. A criterion β is defined to evaluate OA volume flow using Equation (9). (9) β = V OAs − V OA V OAs 100 % where V OAs is the OA volume flow setpoint, V OA is the measured OA volume flow, and β reflects the degree of deviation between measured and demand OA volume flow. β\u202f<\u202f0 indicates that the measured OA volume flow is larger than the demand OA volume flow, while β\u202f>\u202f0 indicates that the measured OA volume flow is smaller than the demand OA volume flow. Changes occurring in the set and measured values of OA volume flow with respect to changes in the indoor CO2 concentration and total air volume flow demand of terminals V TDs are illustrated in Fig. 16 and the evaluation indices of OA volume flow are shown in Table 9 . A\u2013H are the inflection points of the OA volume flow setpoints when indoor CO2 concentration and total demand air volume flow of terminals V TDs change simultaneously (the change number is 8). The setpoints respond quickly to integrated changes in indoor CO2 and V TDs. It can be concluded from Table 9 that the average measured value of OA volume flow is higher than the average set value at different setpoints and total test time; further, β\u202f<\u202f0. Especially, there is a positive deviation when the OA volume flow setpoint was 650\u202fm3/h. The average values of OA volume flow were 163\u202fm3/h and 175\u202fm3/h when the OA volume flow setpoint was 150\u202fm3/h. The control effect of air volume flow supply and OA volume flow supply is illustrated in Fig. 17 , and the corresponding control indices are shown in Table 10 . In the process of changing the setpoint of OA volume flow, the setpoint corresponding to static pressure of supply air volume flow also changes with respect to indoor load. It can be observed in Table 10 that the average measured and set values of differential pressure of supply air volume flow and OA volume flow are basically the same. A good control effect is observed for supply air volume flow control loop and OA volume flow control loop in the trial-and-error method for determining discrete variable OA volume flow setpoints. BOX-A is considered as an example to analyze the control effect of the air volume flow of the terminal BOX (Fig. 18 ). The average relative deviation of measured and set values of air volume and indoor temperature of BOX-A are 10.04% and 5.39%, respectively. The indoor temperature is about 15\u202f°C before the experiment, indoor temperature reaches the setpoint within 15min after the beginning of the experiment and respond quickly to the change of indoor temperature setpoint. Thus, BOX-A can meet the requirements of air volume flow setpoint of terminals and the same conclusion applies to BOX-B and BOX-C. Changes in the indoor positive pressure and supply air temperature are shown in Fig. 19 . During the experiment, indoor positive pressure was higher than 5\u202fPa for 94% of the total time, the average temperature of air volume flow supply was 26.82\u202f°C, and the set temperature of air volume supply was 26\u202f°C. Adjusting the water valve cannot change the temperature of supply air volume flow immediately and this delay leads to a large temperature deviation, but the overall effect of air supply temperature is acceptable, with the average relative deviation is 6.63%. 5 Conclusion An optimal control method based on differential pressure control for the determination of discrete variable OA volume flow setpoints in VAV systems is proposed in this study. This method not only meets the requirements of IAQ, but also results in better energy savings and control performance than typical maximum OA ratio control strategy and on-demand ventilation method. A PI calculation method and trial-and-error method were employed to determine discretized OA volume flow setpoints, and comparative experiments were conducted to analyze the advantages of the two methods. Finally, the discrete variable OA volume flow setpoint control method based on the trial-and-error method is taken as an example to verify the feasibility of the proposed method. The major conclusions of this study are as follows. (1) The PI calculation method can more easily ensure IAQ in the case of high indoor demands for OA volume flow and exhibits a better pressure control effect. Meanwhile, the trial-and-error method exhibits advantages of simple operation, flexible step size setting, and less energy consumption. (2) The strategy of discretizing OA volume flow setpoints also greatly reduces the action of OA damper and increases the stability of the system compared to continuous OA volume flow setpoints control. (3) During feasibility analysis experiments, the proposed method can quickly respond to changes in the indoor demand and take measures to achieve a good control effect. It also could meet the demands for OA volume flow and maintain good IAQ at high (650\u202fm3/h) and low (150\u202fm3/h) OA volume flow setpoints. (4) In practical applications, the actual needs of users should be considered to choose the appropriate discretization method for variable OA volume flow setpoint determination. The PI calculation method is suitable for high IAQ requirement cases. Meanwhile, the trial-and-error method can be used for comfort air-conditioning systems to adjust the indoor environment. When a system has high indoor environment requirements, the two methods can be combined to determine discrete variable OA volume flow setpoint to achieve a better control effect.

        "dc:description": "In multi-zone variable outdoor air (OA) volume air-conditioning systems, there is often a mismatch between OA volume flow supply and demand, because variable air volume (VAV) systems exhibit nonlinear, multivariable, and long delay characteristics. Traditional methods ensure indoor air quality (IAQ) by increasing OA volume flow, which leads to a waste of OA flow energy. To address this problem, an optimal control method for determining discrete variable OA volume flow setpoints, based on differential pressure control, is proposed in this study. In this method, changes in indoor CO2 concentration and the total air volume flow demand of terminals are regarded as constraints of OA volume flow setpoints. A Proportional-Integral (PI) calculation method and trial-and-error method are used to discretize continuous OA volume flow setpoints to increase system stability. Two types of experiments were conducted to compare the characteristics of the two discrete OA volume flow setpoint determining methods, and to verify the feasibility of our new approach. The results show that the OA volume flow control loop can be well fitted with other control loops of VAV systems, and ensure OA volume flow demand for a target area. The proposed method provides greater energy savings than maximum OA ratio control strategy (7%\u201322%) and typical on-demand ventilation method (6.1%), and better control performance than continuous OA volume flow setpoints control system. The PI calculation method is suitable for conditions with high IAQ requirements, while the trial-and-error method can be used for comfort air-conditioning systems to adjust the indoor environment.",
