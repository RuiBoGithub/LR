Data-driven modeling achieves excellent performance in building load prediction by mining the actual load characteristic from operation data. When predicting room air-conditioning load, however, the measured data of cooling capacity cannot be used as the load label in the modeling as customary. The reason lies in the unstable automatic control of the air-conditioner, which makes the cooling capacity oscillate at the actual load. The mismatch of cooling capacity and actual load will affect prediction modeling. This paper first sets up a simulation experiment to quantitatively analyze this effect. The results indicate that the more the cooling capacity deviates from the load, the greater the error of the prediction model. To solve this problem, a load extraction method based on the Fourier decomposition is proposed, which involves transforming the actual cooling capacity data into the frequency domain and extracting the low-frequency components as load data, which is further used for modeling. The experiments show that the accuracy between extracted data and real load exceeds 90%. Additionally, the load extraction method improves the prediction accuracy by up to 17.55% compared to the model using cooling capacity data directly. Finally, a practical case demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed load extraction method.

It provides important data support for solving problems related to building load prediction using artificial intelligence methods such as machine learning [1,2]. In recent years, data-driven models have been widely used in building load prediction modeling in effectively capturing actual load characteristics [3] and improving prediction accuracy [4]. The success of data-driven models in traditional engineering fields relies on algorithms and data [5]. As shown in Fig. 1 , an appropriate model algorithm is selected and a large number of sample data are used to train the model parameters, which learn the optimal model parameter set that can characterize the mapping relationship between the input and output. Suitable machine learning algorithms can reflect the complex mapping relationship between the input and output of the modeling object, while the data serves as the fundamental basis for learning an accurate model under the algorithm architecture. Currently, machine learning technology has been widely used in data-driven building air-conditioning load prediction models. Many scholars have conducted various advanced machine learning algorithms including time series [6], support vector machines (SVM) [7], random forests (RF) [8], artificial neural networks (ANN) [9], and deep learning models [10] in the field of air-conditioning load prediction and achieved excellent prediction results. However, these studies are focusing more on upgrading load prediction algorithms. Essentially, data-driven models mainly rely on historical data to train parameters, and the prediction effect depends more on the available data conditions [11]. Data is the key factor that determines the upper limit of a model's learning effect, and the model algorithm is only used to approximate this upper limit. For data-driven models to accurately reflect the true characteristics of an object, data should meet the following three conditions: (1) Feature data should be complete. Only when the feature variable set contains all the information that can provide the fluctuation and change required to describe the output, can the training error of the data-driven model be minimized. (2) Samples data ({features, label}) should be complete. Only when a sufficient number of samples are monitored and obtained (covering the entire learning space in theory), can the generalization error of the data-driven model be minimized. (3) Label data should be accurate. The label is the object to be predicted, and only by accurately obtaining it can the expected content of the model's predicted output be ensured. In recent years, researchers in the field of data-driven air-conditioning load predicting have gradually realized the important role of data in the load prediction modeling process. In terms of feature data, due to mature monitoring methods, outdoor meteorological parameters such as outdoor temperature, solar radiation, wind speed, relative humidity, and other external factors are often used as external influences on air-conditioning load. In addition, with the development of passive building energy conservation, the impact of internal disturbances on the load is becoming more and more significant. Data that characterize internal disturbances are becoming increasingly important. Calendar data [12] or fixed schedule data [34] are the most commonly used data to represent internal disturbances. Researchers have also explored the use of various sensing technologies to perceive the number of people and their activity patterns in buildings and to use them as data inputs to the load prediction model to improve the prediction accuracy, such as cameras [13], passive infrared sensors [14], mobile phone GPS sensors [15] and social network logs [16]. Based on many internal and external disturbance feature data, feature engineering techniques such as principal component analysis [17] and autoencoder networks [18], are often used to process basic feature data into model-friendly model input variables. This is done to fully extract valuable information from the feature data and improve the accuracy of the load prediction model. In terms of sample data, Fan et al. [19] confirmed that the prediction accuracy of the BP neural network model shows a significant downward trend with the decrease in training sample data. In engineering practice, there are often situations where insufficient sample data exists, such as newly built systems that have only been tested for a short period or a large amount of missing data due to data storage and data quality issues. Qian et al. [20] found that when using ANN for short- and medium-term cooling load forecasting, using short-term weekly data as training and validation data for full cold season forecasting, the prediction accuracy is significantly lower than that of using full-year data to build the model. Therefore, the authors used simulated data to enhance the training samples, which increased the prediction model accuracy under conditions of small sample data by 10%. To better use simulated data to enhance the training samples of the load prediction model, Lu et al. [21] proposed using transfer learning to integrate the calibrated simulation model-generated data with actual sample data. In addition, by drawing on the rich actual monitoring data of other similar buildings and using transfer learning methods, the problem of insufficient sample data in the target building load prediction model can also be solved [22]. Currently, researchers have conducted many studies on the feature and sample data aspects to ensure the effective application of data-driven load prediction models. However, little attention has been paid to the accurate acquisition of air-conditioning load labels in practical engineering. From a definition perspective, air-conditioning load refers to the amount of heat that needs to be removed or added in a unit of time to maintain indoor thermal and humidity parameters at set values. In practice, since it is difficult to directly monitor the load, indirect measurement methods are typically used, which monitor the cooling/heating capacity data of air-conditioning equipment instead of the load data. Indirect measurement methods are used to obtain load labels by ensuring that the supply and demand of air-conditioning equipment are balanced, which is indicated by stable control of indoor thermal and humidity parameters at set points [23]. This paper focuses on room air-conditioners, which are typically controlled by temperature set points. And the control strategy is adjusted in a short time window, making it prone to overshooting during operation [24], as shown in Fig. 2 . The unstable control phenomenon can be attributed to two reasons. Firstly, due to the thermal inertia of the buildings themselves, there are delays in the response of the indoor temperature to changes in the air-conditioning system [25]. Secondly, the traditional feedback control and proportional integral different (PID) control methods either ignore real-time load changes, or the overshoot and stability time is difficult to balance [26], resulting in fluctuations in the cooling/heating capacity data. Therefore, researchers [27] usually discard some cooling capacity data with large temperature fluctuations to ensure the accuracy of the load labels used for model training. However, if actual cooling capacity data is used as the load label for model training, the model would learn unstable cooling capacity instead of the expected load. This issue is particularly problematic for ultra-short-term room air-conditioning load prediction at minute-level prediction scales, where inaccurate load label acquisition may significantly affect the application of data-driven models. However, there is currently a gap in research on this issue, including how the inaccurate load label affects data-driven models and what methods can be used to mitigate this impact to ensure the effectiveness of data-driven prediction models. These problems still need further analysis and research. To address the problem of inaccurate load labeling, this paper first sets up a simulation experiment to quantitatively analyze this effect and then proposes a load extraction method based on the Fourier decomposition. The first phase is to utilize EnergyPlus and Modelica co-simulation experiments for room and air-conditioning equipment, which obtains the data on room cooling load and cooling capacity. Based on these datasets, the paper quantitatively evaluates the inaccuracy of load labeling and its impact on data-driven load prediction models. Then, a load label extraction method based on Fourier frequency domain decomposition is proposed to extract load labels from actual cooling capacity data. The effectiveness of the load label extraction method in improving the accuracy of ultra-short-term load prediction models is tested in multiple simulations and real scenarios. The structure of this paper is as follows: the first section is the introduction. The second section contains a brief introduction to quantitative analysis and the methodology of load label extraction in the study. The third and fourth sections provide quantitative analysis results and effectiveness verification of the method. The fifth section is the discussion, and the sixth section is the conclusion. 2 Methodology 2.1 Research framework The overall research framework of this paper includes four parts (as shown in Fig. 3 ). First, the EnergyPlus and Modelica co-simulation method is used to obtain the data foundation for analyzing the data problem. EnergyPlus is used to simulate the actual room load. Based on this load simulation, Modelica is used to simulate the actual operating performance of the air-conditioner to obtain cooling capacity data. Then, the deviation of using the air-conditioner's cooling capacity data as the load label is quantitatively evaluated. The impact of this problem on three different data-driven load prediction models is tested. To mitigate the impact of the inaccurate load label, a load label extraction method based on Fourier frequency domain decomposition is proposed, which extracts the room load label from the actual operating data of the air conditioner. Finally, the paper explores the application of the proposed method in practical ultra-short-term load forecasting cases. 2.2 Data generation To quantitatively evaluate the data problem, it is necessary to obtain the room load data and the operational cooling capacity data of the air-conditioner. This paper uses the co-simulation method to obtain data, as shown in Fig. 4 . In recent years, the co-simulation approach has gained significant attention and application in the field of Model Predictive Control (MPC) [28,29]. Currently, EnergyPlus is capable of performing co-simulation with programs such as Matlab/Simulink and Modelica. However, for complex energy system modeling, Modelica offers an object-oriented modeling approach that allows for detailed and flexible representation of components and systems. So in this paper, EnergyPlus is used to simulate room load data, while Modelica is used to simulate the dynamic behavior of the air-conditioner and obtain the cooling capacity data. According to the Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) standard [30] proposed by the European Information Technology for European Advancement 2 (ITEA2) in 2010, each simulation software provides a unified interface specification, which allows all simulation software to encapsulate models into FMU-compressed files for use by other simulation software according to FMI. Other software can also import FMU files according to the FMI standard, thereby achieving multi-domain joint simulation. An air-conditioning system is selected in this paper, and its physical model and control models are established in Dymola based on Modelica. The model includes the refrigerant side and the air side, corresponding to the control strategy of the refrigerant flow and the fan frequency. The signal of the air side control and the refrigerant side control is jointly determined by the indoor temperature set value and the actual indoor temperature. Two control points are set in the control loop of the refrigerant side: one is to adjust the flow rate by the expansion valve in a staged manner, and the other is to set the response time of the control strategy. After the equipment runs for one response period, the deviation between the actual room temperature and the set point is compared, and the expansion valve opening is adjusted in stages. Another control point is set in the air side control loop: the fan frequency is adjusted in stages. When the fan needs to increase or decrease the gear, a fixed delay time of 300 s is set. The controller compares the deviation between the actual room temperature and the temperature set point and changes the final output control signal only after 300 s. Based on the co-simulation of EnergyPlus and Modelica, the process is as follows: First, the indoor air temperature and humidity are calculated by EnergyPlus. Along with the obtained outdoor air temperature and humidity data, they are passed to Modelica. Then, the return air from the indoor environment is processed by the fan and mixed with the indoor air, and the latent and sensible heat transfer power during the mixing process is sent to the FMU. Last, the calculation of the indoor air temperature and humidity is passed back to EnergyPlus through the FMU. This process is repeated until the end of the specified date. 2.3 Quantitative evaluation of the inaccurate load label 2.3.1 Evaluation of inaccurate load label This paper uses the relative deviation MAPElab to quantitatively evaluate the inaccuracy of load labels, as defined in Equation (1) (1) M A P E l a b = 1 n ∑ i = 1 n Data c - Data L Data L where n is the size of the dataset and Data c , Data L are the cooling capacity value and the room load value. A higher value of MAPElab indicates a higher inaccuracy of the load label. In addition, the load label extraction method aims to minimize MAPElab, which reflects efforts to mitigate inaccuracies in them. 2.3.2 Construction of ultra-multi-step short-term load prediction model This paper constructed three commonly used data-driven models to analyze the impact of the inaccurate load label on load prediction. The specific process involves three steps: (1) For the testing groups, the cooling capacity is used as the load label to construct the model, and its predicted results are compared with the room load. (2) For the control group, the load data is used as the load label to construct the model, and its predicted results are compared with the room load. (3) The difference between these comparison results is calculated, representing the impact of using cooling capacity data instead of load data as the load label on load prediction accuracy. The algorithms used include autoregressive model with exogenous variables (ARX), random forest regression (RF) and artificial neural network (ANN). \u2022 Model 1: ARX The model algorithm is described in Equation (2): (2) CL t = σ 1 CL t - 1 + σ 2 CL t - 2 + ⋯ + σ 30 CL t - 30 + σ 31 T t + σ 32 Where, CL t represents the predicted variable at time step t . CL t - i ( i = 1 ⋯ 30 ) represents the historical load items at time step t - i . T t is the outdoor temperature. σ 1 , σ 2 \u2026 σ 30 are the historical load coefficients. σ 31 is the outdoor temperature coefficient. σ 32 is the white noise value. \u2022 Model 2: RF The RF model is a model that trains and predicts samples using multiple decision tree models. Non-leaf nodes represent feature variables, and leaf nodes represent the output values of the model. The relationship between each output value and the corresponding feature variable is determined by the path from the root node to the leaf node. How ensure the purity of the samples contained in the branching node during the splitting process is the key to RF models. To solve this problem, the RF model based on the Gini index is used in this paper. \u2022 Model 3: ANN ANN is a network model composed of multiple layers of neurons, and the operation process includes forward calculation and backpropagation. Each neuron receives an input signal, multiplies it by the corresponding connection weight, adds a bias term, and calculates the output. If the predicted results of the output layer differ significantly from the expected output results, the error is returned along the original path, and the connection weights between neurons are updated. This process is iterative until the error meets the expected requirements. The input variables for the models above consist of 1 h of historical cooling capacity data and weather data, including outdoor temperature and solar radiation. The model outputs are room load predictions for the next 10 min in 2-minute increments. To achieve multi-step load forecasting, a recursive calculation method is adopted, where the predicted result of each step serves as the input variable for the next step, as illustrated in Fig. 5 . 2.3.3 Evaluation of prediction performance In this study, mean absolute percent error (MAPE) and coefficient of variation (CV) are used as the metrics to evaluate the performance of the prediction models, as defined in Eqs. (3)-(4): (3) M A P E % = 1 n ∑ i = 1 n y predict , i - y data , i y data , i × 100 (4) C V % = ∑ i = 1 n y predict , i - y data , i 2 n y ¯ data × 100 where, y predict , i and y data , i respectively represent the predicted and actual room load values at the time i . y ¯ data is the average load value, and n is the total number of predicted data. The smaller the value of CV and MAPE, the more accurate the prediction models are. 2.4 Load label extraction method based on FFT 2.4.1 Load label extraction method This section introduces a load label extraction method based on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) that aims to mitigate the impact of the inaccurate load label on the prediction model. Buildings are typically characterized as having large inertia systems, resulting in load curves that exhibit low-frequency oscillations with a smooth curve. However, due to the transient nature of air-conditioning control, actual cooling capacity data based on the current load can exhibit high-frequency fluctuations. Transforming the cooling capacity data from the time domain to the frequency domain enables the decomposition of the data into two components: large periodic load fluctuations (low frequency) and small periodic fluctuations caused (high frequency). Therefore, the low-frequency load characteristics can be extracted by filtering out the high-frequency fluctuation components. The Fourier transform is used in this paper to obtain the frequency-domain distribution [31] of the cooling capacity and room load. The Fourier transform method can expand any function of a variable into a series of sine waves with a series of periods whether continuous or discontinuous. Since the collected data are discrete, this paper uses the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm, which can significantly reduce computation time by using periodicity and symmetry [32]. The FFT algorithm of an n-point load CL can be represented with the following equation: (5) cl k = ∑ j = 0 N 2 - 1 CL 2 j e - 2 π k j i N / 2 + e - 2 π k i N ∑ j = 0 N 2 - 1 CL 2 j + 1 e - 2 π k j i N / 2 where CL j and cl k represent the j -th time-domain load data and the k -th frequency-domain load data. N is the size of the data set, and k = 0 , 1 , 2 , ⋯ , N − 1, j = 0 , 1 , 2 , ⋯ , N − 1. The results obtained from (5) can be expressed in complex form as (6), which represents the harmonic corresponding to the k -th frequency after FFT, where a and b represent the real and imaginary parts. (6) cl k = a i + b The amplitude of the k -th frequency harmonic is represented by the equation (7): (7) cl k \u2032 = a 2 + b 2 The frequency is calculated using the following equation (8), where f s is the sampling interval and N is the size of the data set: (8) f k = k ∗ f s N Previous research [33] has demonstrated that the hourly cooling load can be approximately represented by its first three harmonics. This suggests that the impact of harmonics with a period of fewer than 6 h is negligible. However, for the minute-level load sequences discussed in this study, it is assumed that the changes in harmonics with a period of less than or equal to 3 h are not caused by external disturbances but rather by random fluctuations resulting from unstable control. This paper extracts 7 frequency points with a period of 24 h and their multiples from all frequency points, and combined the corresponding harmonics for these seven points. Then the fast Fourier inverse transform is applied to transfer the data from the frequency domain back to the time domain. The specific implementation process is shown in Fig. 6 . The specific formulas for harmonic selection and Fourier inverse transform are as follows equations: (9) cl k \u2032 \u2032 = cl k \u2032 k = 0 , 1 , ⋯ 7 0 k = 8 , 9 , ⋯ N - 1 (10) CL \u2032 j = 1 N ∑ k \u2032 = 0 N - 1 cl k \u2032 \u2032 e 2 π k \u2032 j i n where CL \u2032 j represents the j -th time-domain load data after load extraction, and cl k \u2032 \u2032 is the k \u2032 th frequency domain data, with k \u2032 = 0 , 1 , 2 , ⋯ , N − 1,j = 0 , 1 , 2 , ⋯,N − 1. CL \u2032 j represents the application result of the load label extraction method. 2.4.2 Load prediction based on load label extraction method More accurate load label is obtained through the load label extraction method, which can be used to train and test the load prediction models. Specifically, the extracted historical load and external weather data are utilized as input variables, with the output variable being the load for the next 10 min in 2-minute increments. The predicted results will be compared to the extracted load to calculate the prediction error of the models. The algorithms of the prediction models and prediction structure are the same as described in Section 2.3.2. 3 Quantitative analysis of inaccurate load label 3.1 Data description and model construction In this study, a three-story office building located in Nanjing, a hot summer and cold winter region, is selected as the model, as shown in Fig. 7 and Table 1 . The building measures 15 m × 15 m × 9 m, and one of the south rooms on the second floor is chosen. EnergyPlus weather input files are obtained from the Chinese Standard Weather Data (CSWD), including dry bulb temperature and solar radiation data. The indoor heat sources, such as residents, lighting, and equipment, are determined by the operating schedule of the office building, which is based on the Design Standard for Energy Efficiency of Public Buildings (GB50189-2015) in China. Then an air-conditioner control system model is constructed by Modelica and EnergyPlus co-stimulation. 13 simulation scenarios are generated using five expansion valve opening adjustment strategies, four refrigerant-side control response periods, and two fan variable frequency strategies. The specific case strategies are shown in Table 2 . To maintain the indoor temperature at 24℃, the supply air temperature is set to 16℃, and the time step for the simulation is set to 2 min. The simulation generates room load data and cooling capacity data from July 2 to July 31. The ultra-short-term multi-step load prediction model is constructed which describes in Section 2.3.2. The data from July 2 to July 8 are used for the training section, and the data from July 9 to July 30 are used for the testing section. 3.2 Quantitative evaluation of inaccurate load label In this section, the inaccuracy of the load label is quantitatively evaluated according to MAPElab defined according to Subsection 2.3.1. The MAPElab of 13 cases is summarized in Table 3 , ranging from 11.50% to 20.28%. Among them, the value of Case 13 is the smallest, indicating good control performance of the control system. In contrast, the worst control effect is observed in Case 6, with a high MAPElab of 20.28%, indicating a significant mismatch between cooling capacity and actual load. To analyze the impact of the inaccurate load label on load prediction, the deviation of the load label is quantitatively evaluated for the 13 tested cases and the control group according to Subsection 2.3.2. Table 3 also summarizes the results of multi-step load prediction errors. The results show that as the MAPElab increases from 11.50% to 20.28%, the CV of ARX, RF, and ANN model (compared with the control group) increase from 4.22% to 13.19%, 9.12% to 21.71%, and 4.10% to 9.02%. As shown in Fig. 8 , the curve results show that the higher the degree of inaccuracy of the load label, the worst the model prediction performance. This proves that the inaccurate load label caused by unstable cooling capacity data can result in poor load prediction performance. Conversely, steady changes in cooling capacity data can help alleviate this problem. These observations underscore the challenge posed by the inaccurate load label in achieving optimal load prediction accuracy. 4 Verification of the load label extraction method 4.1 Load label extraction based on FFT In this section, the proposed method presented in Section 2.4 is applied to the cooling capacity and cooling load dataset to address the issue of the inaccurate load label. We compared the data after FFT of cooling capacity and cooling load. The magnitude and value distribution of the two data amplitudes are shown in Fig. 9 . The green lines on the right side of Fig. 9 connect the amplitudes of the two data at the same frequency, and the slope of the lines can be used to distinguish the substantial difference between the two data amplitudes in different frequency bands. It can be seen that within the frequency range of 0.0 to 0.1, both cooling capacity and cooling load exhibit a similar distribution. However, a distinct downward trend can be observed in the green lines within the frequency range of 0.1 to 0.5. This discrepancy in high-frequency ranges is primarily caused by short-term fluctuations or delays in the control system rather than internal or external disturbances affecting the load changes. Such inaccuracies in load labeling result from these fluctuations. Furthermore, within the frequency range of 0.0 to 0.1, seven frequencies demonstrate significantly higher amplitudes compared to others. These frequencies correspond to seven sine waves with periods of 24 h, 12 h, 8 h, 6 h, 24/5 h, 24/6 h, and 24/7 h. These pieces of evidence demonstrate that the effectiveness of the load label extraction method proposed in this paper in achieving the goal of accurately extracting cooling load information. Using the proposed method, the load label is extracted from the cooling capacity data recorded from July 2 to July 8, and the extracted labels are compared with the load data. The results in Table 4 indicate that the data processing strategy significantly improves the accuracy of load labeling in each case. The extraction results for the four days are illustrated in Fig. 10 , indicating that the load label extraction method can effectively resolve the problem of the inaccurate load label. 4.2 Effectiveness verification in simulation cases To verify that the proposed method can address the data problem in the load prediction, this subsection tests 13 cases based on the load extraction in subsection 4.1. The control group constructs the load prediction model using cooling capacity data as the load label, whereas the experimental groups construct the load prediction model using load labels extracted by the proposed method. Fig. 11 illustrates the comparison of the prediction performance between the control and the experimental groups. As depicted in Fig. 11(a), the prediction results of the control group deviate considerably from the target prediction. However, Fig. 11(b) shows a significant improvement in the prediction results of the experimental group. Table 5 provides a detailed account of load prediction accuracy. Case 8 exhibits the worst prediction performance in the control group, with a MAPE of 17.20% and a CV of 19.47% on the ANN model. While after applying the load label extraction, the experimental group shows a remarkable improvement with a MAPE of 6.66% and a CV of 8.85%. Even for Case 13, which initially exhibited the best prediction performance, the proposed method still resulted in a 2.79% reduction in the prediction error. A comparison of Table 3 and Table 5 reveals a significant reduction in prediction error across 13 cases under the proposed method. These findings demonstrate that the proposed method is an effective solution for reducing label inaccuracy and improving the predictive capabilities of load prediction models. Furthermore, Fig. 12 depicts the error histogram for the three load prediction models, comparing results from the control and experimental groups. It can also be found that the proposed method demonstrates a positive impact on the accuracy of various prediction algorithms. The degree of improvement differs among the three models, with the ARX and RF models exhibiting more significant improvements compared to the ANN model. Upon analysis, it was discovered that the ANN model outperforms other models in load forecasting when load extraction is not utilized, suggesting that the inaccurate load label has a lesser effect on the ANN model. 4.3 Effectiveness verification in actual scenarios To validate the actual effectiveness of the load label extraction method, this paper collected actual data from two residential buildings situated in Guangzhou and Shanghai's Xuhui, China. As shown in Fig. 13 , the data utilized in the section was obtained from the air conditioning cloud platform and encompassed cooling capacity, outdoor ambient air temperature and indoor air temperature. The outdoor ambient air temperature was measured using a sensor installed on the outdoor unit of the air conditioner, while the indoor air temperature was measured at the evaporator inlet within the air conditioner. Notably, it should be mentioned that detailed information regarding the building's construction, as well as its internal equipment and terminals, was unavailable. The data collected from Guangzhou, China, spanning from 1/6/2021 to 30/6/2021, is utilized for the training section, while the data collected from 1/7/2021 to 31/7/20211 is utilized for testing. Similarly, the data collected from Xuhui, Shanghai, China, ranging from 1/7/2021 to 31/7/2021, is utilized for training, and the data from 1/8/2021 to 31/8/2021 is utilized for testing. The load extraction results achieved through the proposed method and the corresponding predicted results are presented in Fig. 14 and Fig. 15 . Fig. 14(a) and Fig. 15(a) depict the one-week results of the entire testing dataset, while Fig. 14(b) and Fig. 15(b) showcase the results of the most effective range for the load extraction method, characterized by significant and frequent equipment fluctuations. This suggests that the proposed method can efficiently extract the room load in situations where the equipment operates in an unstable manner or experiences frequent on\u2013off cycles. It achieves this by analyzing the frequency domain fluctuation patterns of the normal cooling capacity observed in the previous days. According to ASHRAE Guideline 14\u20132014, a model can be deemed calibrated and suitable for engineering purposes if its CV is below 15% when monthly data is used or below 30% when hourly data is used. As depicted in Fig. 14(b) and Fig. 15(b), the proposed method excels at extracting room load from the cooling capacity data, and the CV of the proposed method indicate high accuracy, approximately 4.74% and 6.59%. The proposed method demonstrates the ability to effectively and accurately predict the room load, even in situations where the obtained cooling capacity data may be inaccurate. 5 Discussion The proposed load label extraction method can effectively enhance the performance of ultra-short-term load prediction models, as demonstrated in Section 4. In this section, experiments are conducted to demonstrate the practical applicability of the 7th harmonic component derived from air-conditioner cooling capacity data after FFT. Specifically, the cooling load label is extracted from the 3rd to 100th order to analyze the impact of harmonic order selection on extraction effectiveness. As shown in Fig. 16 , the results depict that the increase of the selected harmonic order leads to a decrease in the load label inaccuracy, and the optimal extraction effect is achieved at the 6th order, with the MAPElab starting to increase significantly after the 11th order. The harmonic orders corresponding to the optimal extraction effect are the 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th orders, and the differences in the extracted load effects are small. Notably, the 7th harmonic has a clearer physical meaning compared to other values. Its underlying implication is that harmonics with a period of less than or equal to 3 h are associated with high-frequency fluctuations caused by unstable control systems, and are not linked to changes in room loads. 6 Conclusion Accurate load label is critical for achieving reliable ultra-short-term load forecasting, yet it remains a significant challenge. Although numerous studies have attempted to improve prediction accuracy by addressing issues related to incomplete data features and samples, inaccurate load label resulting from poor air-conditioning system control is still common in actual engineering scenarios. This can seriously affect the forecasting performance of the data-driven load models. However, existing research lacks a quantitative analysis of this problem and offers few solutions. To address this gap, this paper quantitatively evaluates and analyzes the problem of the inaccurate load label and proposes a load label extraction method based on FFT, which can effectively solve this data problem and improve the performance of ultra-short-term load prediction models. Through experimental analysis of simulation models and actual cases, the main conclusions are as follows: (1) This paper obtains dynamic simulation data describing the room load and cooling capacity of the air-conditioners through the EnergyPlus and Modelica co-simulation. Based on different cases, as the inaccuracy of load label (MAPElab) increases from 11.50% to 20.28%, the prediction errors (compared to load labeling accuracy) of three prediction models increase by 8.97%, 12.59%, and 4.92%. Additionally, the deviation between the cooling capacity and the actual load increases when the control level is poorer, leading to further deviation from the optimal model. (2) To address the above-mentioned issue of the inaccurate load label, the proposed load label extraction method can effectively extract load label data from air conditioning cooling capacity data. The extracted load data has a deviation of only 8% to 10% from the actual load. The three data-driven models exhibit an improvement in prediction accuracy of approximately 9.94%, 15.29%, and 23.41% in terms of MAPE, and 9.99%, 11.24%, and 17.55% in terms of CV. Notably, the improvement of load forecasting based on load label extraction is more significant when the control effect of air conditioning equipment during actual operation is poorer, indicating the practical value of the proposed method.

        "dc:description": "Data-driven modeling achieves excellent performance in building load prediction by mining the actual load characteristic from operation data. When predicting room air-conditioning load, however, the measured data of cooling capacity cannot be used as the load label in the modeling as customary. The reason lies in the unstable automatic control of the air-conditioner, which makes the cooling capacity oscillate at the actual load. The mismatch of cooling capacity and actual load will affect prediction modeling. This paper first sets up a simulation experiment to quantitatively analyze this effect. The results indicate that the more the cooling capacity deviates from the load, the greater the error of the prediction model. To solve this problem, a load extraction method based on the Fourier decomposition is proposed, which involves transforming the actual cooling capacity data into the frequency domain and extracting the low-frequency components as load data, which is further used for modeling. The experiments show that the accuracy between extracted data and real load exceeds 90%. Additionally, the load extraction method improves the prediction accuracy by up to 17.55% compared to the model using cooling capacity data directly. Finally, a practical case demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed load extraction method.",
