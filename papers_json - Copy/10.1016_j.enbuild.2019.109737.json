Occupancy-based heating control is important for not only achieving thermal comfort but also reducing the heating energy consumption of residential buildings. In this study, an occupancy inference method was developed for the optimal start and stop control of radiant floor heating systems. The basic concept of the inference is to combine the occupancy probabilities based on the indoor CO2 concentration and passive infrared (PIR) signals. The probability is estimated by applying different probability reduction ratios depending on the derivative of the CO2 concentration and aggregated PIR signals. In a validation experiment, the results showed that the developed algorithm can predict the occupancy with an accuracy of 83.5%\u201398.9%. The inferred occupancy data were used to determine the optimal heating start and stop control to improve energy saving performance and thermal comfort. Parametric simulations were conducted with jEPlus to find the optimal start and stop times. This optimal start and stop control was found to reduce the heating energy consumption by up to 3.1% and thermal discomfort times from 62.5 h to 8.3 h. Keywords Occupancy inference CO2 concentration Passive infrared (PIR) Optimal start Optimal stop Radiant floor heating Residential building 1 Introduction In residential buildings, the heating energy consumption is generally reduced by stopping the hot water supply or decreasing the set-point temperature. Even though various smart thermostats have been introduced [1], reducing the energy consumption in many residential buildings often depends on manual control by the occupants, such as turning off the thermostat or closing isolation valves [2]. Set-back control during unoccupied periods also often depends on the occupants adjusting the set-point temperature when they leave home. Occupants need to readjust the set-point temperature from the set-back temperature when they come back home. Such manual control is quite simple and effective; however, it can be inconvenient and cause discomfort to occupants because it requires repetitive adjustment. Furthermore, the radiant heating system needs to be stopped slightly before the occupants depart because it utilizes the thermal storage effect during an unoccupied period, while it should start slightly earlier than when occupants return home to provide thermal comfort [3]. It is quite difficult for occupants to determine the stop and start time of the heating system because the optimal start and stop time is dependent on the building parameters such as U-value, infiltration rate, thermal mass and boiler capacity [4\u20136]. These parameters can be identified by grey-box model such as inverse modeling [7,8] or co-heating test [9,10]. These data-driven models can be used to develop a model predictive model [11,12]. Once the parameters are identified, it would be convenient to predict the optimal start and stop time to minimize heating energy and thermal discomfort. Another way to implement the predictive control is to apply a black-box model (e.g. Artificial neuron network [4\u20136,13]) to estimate the optimal start and stop time. Rule-based predictive control, which is simpler than above-mentioned methods, can also be used for the optimal start and stop control. It is known that expected occupancy patterns may be used to take preventative actions according to a predetermined set of rules, which provides a simple way to use predictive control [14]. If the average occupancy schedule based on inference results can be combined with the estimated start and stop time, the energy saving potential can be enhanced while the occupants\u2019 inconvenience and thermal discomfort are minimized [15]. The occupancy can be inferred with the direct/indirect detection of human presence in residential buildings. The collected inference results can be used to predict the occupancy, or the timing of departure and arrival time, which can be applied to determine the pre-start or pre-stop time of heating systems. Candanedo et al. [16] suggested a simple methodology to predict the average occupancy schedule, which were derived from the occupancy data inferred from environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, humidity ratio, CO2 and illuminance. Although the authors claimed that the predicted schedule could be used as an input data for energy simulation, it could also be utilized to decide the optimal start and stop time of HVAC system. Huchuck et al. [17] claimed that the future occupancy state can be predicted using connected thermostats having multiple passive infrared (PIR) sensors and can be efficiently used for proactive control in order to manage the delayed thermal effect of residential buildings. Manna et al. [18] also developed a real-time occupancy forecasting method using multi-order Markov model, which can be efficiently applied to predictive control for HVAC system. Li and Dong [19] also put emphasis on the predicted occupancy information, rather than instantaneous detection, because thermal control is often difficult due to the slow response of buildings. For developing indicators to implement precooling or preheating for thermal conditioning system, the authors deployed Markov chain-based machine learning algorithm and demonstrated that 15-min to 1-h ahead prediction is effective in forecasting both occupancy presence and number. These studies on the occupancy prediction show that the average occupancy schedule can be established based on the occupancy detection or inference results. Thus, it is important to apply a proper inference method to determine the average occupancy schedule that can be used to decide pre-stop and start time of heating system. As for the methodology of the occupancy inference, direct or indirect methods can be implemented to detect a human presence in buildings. Trivedi et al. proved that mobile Wi-Fi data can be used to analyze spatial and temporal variations in the occupancy of campus buildings [20]. Wang et al. proposed an approach for detecting occupant counts by using existing Wi-Fi infrastructure and a machine learning technique to curtail the energy consumption of commercial buildings [21]. Benezeth et al. developed a human detection method based on static cameras that can be used for people counting, activity characterization, and people localization in a building [22]. Kamthe et al. deployed battery-operated sensors (i.e., camera) to develop a static occupancy model that can provide an occupancy rate based on relatively short-period datasets [23]. Li et al. proposed a radio-frequency identification (RFID)-based occupancy detection system for demand-driven heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) operation of educational buildings. The proposed system yielded a prediction accuracy of 88% for stationary occupants and 62% for mobile occupants [24]. The above methods can directly detect the occupancy and/or occupant number with fairly high accuracy; however, they may cause privacy problems, particularly in residential buildings. Therefore, various indirect methods of occupancy inference have been developed that use environmental sensors such as the CO2 concentration [25\u201330] or that combine multiple environmental sensors [31\u201336]. Because these indirect methods use non-intrusive environmental sensors, they are more suitable for inferring the occupancy of residential buildings, where privacy protection is more of a priority compared with other building types. CO2-based occupancy inference provides relatively accurate results despite the inexpensive and simple sensors installed. Jin et al. adopted the CO2 concentration as a proxy to predict the number of occupants in a mechanically ventilated office space [26]. Calì et al. demonstrated that an occupancy detection algorithm based on the mass balance equation of CO2 can predict the occupancy profile with an accuracy of up to 95.8% and can identify the number of occupants with an accuracy of up to 80.6% in office and residential buildings [27]. Zuiraimi et al. used the first-order differential CO2 concentration to predict the occupancy count in a large space and reported a prediction accuracy of 76% [28]. Jiang et al. showed that applying a pre-smoothed CO2 concentration in an office space can enhance the real-time estimation of indoor occupants to an accuracy of up to 94% [29]. Although the CO2 concentration has proven to be an effective indicator for human presence during stable and long occupancy, the inference performance often deteriorates when occupants open doors or windows for ventilation, which reduces the CO2 concentration [25]. Because the windows or doors are opened by occupants, the inference performance can be maintained if the occupants\u2019 motion can be detected and incorporated into the inference process. Therefore, a CO2-based inference method can be supplemented by motion sensors, such as PIR sensor, which is widely used for lighting control or security purposes. PIR sensors are commonly used for non-individualized occupancy detection [24], although they have limited applicability to detecting static occupants [37]. Because they can be easily deployed in living environments at a low cost, PIR sensors were utilized in the present study to compensate for the limitations of CO2-based occupancy inference methods. A literature review on occupancy inference showed that machine learning techniques such as the artificial neural network [28,31,38,39], support vector machine [28,31,39], decision tree method [32,16,40], and random forest method [21,35] have been widely developed to predict the occupancy in laboratory environments, residential buildings, commercial buildings, and so on. Because these methods require relatively complicated data processing and a considerable quantity of measurement data, they may be not practical for residential buildings. Thus, a simple algorithm that uses practically applicable sensors needs to be developed for inferring the occupancy of residential buildings. In this context, the aims of the present study were to derive an occupancy inference method that can be implemented with a relatively simple algorithm and hardware configuration and to develop and evaluate an optimal start and stop control based on the inferred occupancy schedule. In this study, the rule-based predictive control was suggested to determine the optimal start and stop time for a building with radiant floor heating system. The main rule adopted in this study was a start and stop time curve, by which the optimal start and stop time is determined with a function of outdoor air temperature. However, it needs to find optimal parameters of the start and stop time curve that can be applied to the target building. To do this, parametric simulations were conducted to find the optimal start and stop time curve, which leads to the minimum heating energy consumption and thermal discomfort. Section 2 presents the research method used to derive the occupancy inference and optimal start and stop control. Section 3 provides the implementation results of the inference method and performance evaluation results of the optimal start and stop control. Section 4 discusses the limitations of this study and required further studies, and Section 5 concludes this paper. 2 Research methods The inference method for residential occupancy was developed by combining CO2- and PIR signal-based occupancy inference strategies. Each strategy estimates the occupancy by using a decay function that defines the time variation of the occupancy probability. The developed inference method was validated against the real occupancy schedule recorded in a residential building. Based on the occupancy probability during a specific time step, the average occupancy schedule was extracted to yield the departure and arrival times on a typical day. The departure and arrival times were used to determine the stop and start times for a radiant floor heating system, which were applied to the energy simulation of a residential building. Parametric simulations were conducted to find the optimal start and stop times that can minimize the heating energy consumption while maintaining an acceptable thermal comfort level. The details of the research method are presented in Sections 2.1\u20132.3. 2.1 Occupancy inference method 2.1.1 Concept of inference Because a human presence usually results in the buildup of the CO2 concentration, a positive value of CO2 concentration derivative (difference in the CO2 concentration between the current and previous time steps) can be used as a proxy for occupancy. However, occupant actions such as opening a window or door can decrease the CO2 concentration, which can cause an error in the occupancy inference. In this case, a supplementary measure is necessary for directly detecting occupant movements. The PIR signal can be used as a straightforward proxy for detecting the motion of occupants; however, it often fails to detect static occupants who are resting or sleeping. Thus, the inference method developed in this study uses both the CO2 concentration and PIR signal so that one proxy can compensate for the inference error caused by the other. The developed inference method comprises two parts, which are detailed below. 2.1.1.1 CO2-based occupancy inference The basic concept of CO2-based occupancy inference in the present study is based on the previous study by Pedersen et al. [36], who estimated the occupancy probability by using the trajectory of indoor climate sensor data. The trajectory is established by tracking the time variation of environmental sensor data such as the CO2 concentration, temperature, and humidity ratio. Once the trajectory is established, the occupancy probability is assumed to be 1 if the trajectory shows a definite positive, while the probability is gradually reduced if the trajectory does not show a positive value. Consequently, the occupancy probability ranges between 0 and 1, and the probability over a user-defined threshold (0.5 according to Pedersen et al. [36]) is assumed to represent the occupied state, as shown in Fig. 1 . Although the trajectory-based method was found to yield good results during the occupied period, it produces somewhat inaccurate results at the end of the occupied period (i.e., miss time) [3] because the probability remains above the threshold even though the occupant has left. Thus, the miss time needs to be minimized by adjusting the reduction ratio of the occupancy probability. In this study, a decay function was assumed for the occupancy probability, where the reduction ratio of the occupancy probability varies at three levels according to the time variations in the CO2 concentration and PIR signal, as shown in Fig. 2 and Eqs. (1) and (2). (1) P C O 2 ( t ) = 1 if Δ C O 2 ( t ) > 0 in the representative room ( e . g . , living room ) (2) P C O 2 ( t ) = P C O 2 ( t − 1 ) − α Here, PCO 2(t) is the occupancy probability based on the CO2 derivative at time t, ∆CO2 (t) is the CO2 derivative in the i-th room at time t, which is calculated as CO2 (t)−CO2 (t−1), and α is the reduction ratio of the CO2-based occupancy probability. This is classified as follows: Case (a) Default reduction ratio: α = α 0 (Fig. 2(a)) Case (b) Maximum reduction ratio: α = α max for Δ C O 2 ( t ) < 0 and P I R ( t ) = 0 in every room (Fig. 2(b)) Case (c) Minimum reduction ratio: α = α min for Δ C O 2 ( t ) > 0 in at least one room (Fig. 2(c) Based on the previous research [36], the default, maximum and minimum reduction ratio were assumed as 0.033, 0.333, and 0.003, respectively, as shown in Fig. 2. In addition, the occupancy inference was based on the CO2 concentration in a representative room (e.g., living room) that can indicate the overall status of a residential building [41]. If the CO2 derivative in the representative room shows a positive value, the occupancy probability at time t (PCO 2(t)) is assumed to be 1 because the increased CO2 concentration implies a definite occupied state. Otherwise, the probability decays with the reduction ratio α. As the unoccupied state results in a negative CO2 derivative and no PIR signal in every room, the reduction ratio is adjusted to its maximum value α max. If the ΔCO2 in the living room does not show the positive value, while ΔCO2 in other rooms show the positive value (e.g. when the occupant shortly stays in the bed room), it may be difficult to definitely decide the status as \u2018occupied\u2019. To deal with this condition, the minimum reduction ratio αmin was used to estimate the occupancy probability. In other cases, the reduction ratio is set to a user-defined default value. 2.1.1.2 PIR-based occupancy inference The PIR sensor can be used to infer the occupancy because it can directly detect the human presence based on infrared light from the occupant in its field of view. If the PIR signal is not zero, the occupancy probability can be assumed to be 1 because the occupant's motion has been detected. If the PIR signal is zero, a predetermined reduction ratio is deducted from the occupancy probability of the previous time step. Because the PIR sensor is effective at detecting the instantaneous movement of occupants within its detection range, it may sometimes fail to detect occupants outside its range, even if an occupant stays in the building. For this reason, the temporary absence of a PIR signal may not be directly translated to the unoccupied state. It is reasonable to assume that the building is unoccupied if the PIR signal is not observed for a relatively long time (e.g., 10 min [42,43]). This characteristic is reflected in the probability decay function given by Eqs. (3) and (4). As shown in the lower part of Fig. 3 , the PIR-based inference result compensates for misses by the CO2-based inference result. (3) P P I R ( t ) = 1 if P I R i ( t ) ≠ 0 (4) P P I R ( t ) = P P I R ( t − 1 ) − β if P I R i ( t ) = 0 Here, PPIR (t) is the occupancy probability estimated with the PIR signal at time t, PIRi (t) is the PIR signal (occupied: 1, unoccupied: 0) in the i-th room at time t, and β is the reduction ratio of the PIR-based occupancy probability. Because the suggested inference algorithm depends on the time derivative of the CO2 concentration (∆CO2 (t)), obtaining an accurate trajectory of the CO2 concentration is important. Thus, the buildup or decay trend of the CO2 concentration needs to be acquired, while the measurement noise needs to be removed. The Kalman filter is an effective measure that optimizes the tradeoff between the tracking performance and noise sensitivity [44]. It can also be implemented with a relatively simple algorithm because its recursive method uses the present measured value and previously calculated state [45]. In this study, the Kalman filter method was adopted to estimate the time derivative CO2 concentration: (5) F ( C O 2 ( t ) ) = K · C O 2 ( t ) + ( 1 − K ) · F ( C O 2 ( t − 1 ) ) where F(CO2 (t)) is the Kalman filtered CO2 concentration in the i-th room at time t [ppm] and K is the Kalman gain. Fig. 4 shows the developed inference algorithm, which is composed of the CO2- and PIR-based occupancy inference algorithms. Each occupancy inference loop produces an inference result with a Boolean value (0 or 1). The final inference is determined by combining the inference results from each inference loop, or the Boolean addition of the CO2- and PIR-based inference results. 2.1.2 Verification method of the inference algorithm In order to verify the applicability of the inference algorithm, it was used to infer the occupancy based on the CO2 concentration and PIR signal measured in a real residential building. Fig. 5 shows the floor plan and sensor deployment in the investigated building. Tables 1 and 2 summarizes the detailed information of the verification experiment and the specifications of the sensors, respectively. The investigated building comprised a living room, kitchen, and three bedrooms and was inhabited by three occupants (two adults and one child). CO2 sensors were deployed 1.2 m from the floor, and their positions were determined to minimize the direct influence from the perspiration of occupants and infiltration. PIR sensors were installed above the door to detect movement in the whole room. The delay time of the PIR sensor was configured to the minimum value (0.3 s), and the detection coverage was set to the maximum value (110°) for the instantaneous and wide detection of human movement. The CO2 concentration and PIR signal were measured for 2 weeks (March 7\u201320, 2017). The accuracy of the suggested algorithm was evaluated through a comparison of the inference result with the ground truth occupancy, which was obtained from occupants\u2019 records of departure and arrival time. Because problems with the sensor battery led to missing measurement data for 2 days, the inference results of 12 days were used to evaluate the accuracy of the algorithm. The performance of the algorithm was investigated using the confusion matrix [16] as indicated in Table 3 . For the performance evaluation, the inference result of each day was analyzed in terms of accuracy, precision and recall, which can be formulated with Eqs. (6)\u2013(8): (6) Accuracy = ( TP + TN ) / ( TP + TN + FP + FN ) (7) Precision = TP / ( TP + FP ) (8) Recall = TP / ( TP + FN ) 2.2 Optimal start and stop control 2.2.1 Optimal start and stop algorithm In this study, the optimal start and stop times were assumed to depend on the outdoor air temperature a few hours before the probable arrival and departure times. For example, the outdoor air temperature at 1:00 AM can provide information on how early the heating system should be stopped. This approach to optimizing the start and stop times was programmed in DesignBuilder software [46]. As described in Fig. 6 , the start and stop times were determined by applying optimal start and stop time curves. The curves were assumed as a linear function of outdoor function, as the time required for the room air temperature to reach set-point temperature can be approximated as a linear function of the outdoor air temperature [47]. For example, the optimal stop curve shows that the stop time is inversely proportional to the outdoor air temperature at 1:00 AM. This curve indicates that a low outdoor air temperature would delay the stop time to ensure thermal comfort. A high outdoor air temperature may allow the heating system to stop much earlier than the departure time, which would reduce the heating energy. However, the stop time should be determined within the upper limit (TimeStop max at the low threshold outdoor air temperature TempStop min) and the lower limit (TimeStop min at the high threshold outdoor air temperature TempStop max). TimeStop max was adopted to prevent the room air temperature from descending below the comfort criterion for relatively cold weather. On the other hand, TimeStop min was set to maximize the heating energy reduction while maintaining comfort in relatively mild weather. For optimal start control, the outdoor air temperature at 1:00 PM was utilized to decide the start time, which is determined with the value between TimeStart min and TimeStart max. TimeStart max was used to maximize the heating energy consumption in mild weather (i.e., the outdoor air temperature is higher than TempStart max), while TimeStart min was adopted to provide sufficient preheating time in cold weather (i.e., the outdoor air temperature is lower than TempStart min). 2.2.2 Simulation model An EnergyPlus simulation was conducted to evaluate the heating energy consumption and thermal comfort in a residential building equipped with a radiant floor heating system. Table 4 summarizes the input parameters for the simulation. The information on the building fabrics such as U values of wall, floor, and window was referred to the energy-saving building design guideline [48] that was enforced when the investigated building was constructed. The infiltration data was referred to the previous study about the building regulation on energy consumption of residential buildings in Korea [49]. The average occupancy schedule was derived based on the above-mentioned occupancy inference algorithm and was applied to determine the optimal start and stop control of the radiant floor heating system. The average schedule was inputted as simulation parameters such as internal gains and heating system operation schedule. The method to derive the average occupancy schedule is explained in the Section 3.1.2 Because the optimal start and stop control is a function that overrides the schedule of the heating system based on the outdoor air temperature, the control function was implemented to the simulation loop via the energy management system (EMS) [50] in the EnergyPlus software. EnergyPlus Runtime Language (ERL) was utilized to develop the optimal start and stop time curves for determining the start and stop times according to the outdoor air temperatures at 1:00 AM and 1:00 PM, respectively. The parameters of the optimal start and stop time curves were determined considering the distribution of the outdoor air temperature and occupancy schedule, as summarized in Table 5 . Because differences in the parameter values can affect the energy performance and thermal comfort, the parameter values needed to be optimized in terms of the heating energy consumption and thermal comfort. The optimization of the parameters is discussed in Section 3. 3 Results 3.1 Implementation results for the occupancy inference 3.1.1 Performance of the occupancy inference Fig. 7 (a) shows the measurement result of CO2 concentration and PIR signals for 24h during the verification experiment. Fig. 7(b) shows the time variation of the occupancy probability derived from the CO2- and PIR-based occupancy decay functions, respectively. Fig. 7(b) shows that the occupancy probability was close to 1 when the CO2 concentration gradually increased, while the probability tended to decrease when the CO2 concentration decreased. At 9:00\u201310:00 and 19:30\u201320:30, the CO2 concentration abruptly decreased, even though a PIR signal was detected. CO2 level can decrease due to the natural ventilation (window opening) or mechanical ventilation, even though the occupants definitely stay in the household [25,41,51]. In this case, it is difficult to infer the occupancy solely from the CO2 concentration; therefore, incorporating the PIR-based inference can improve the accuracy of the occupancy inference. Fig. 8 compares the CO2-based, PIR-based, and combined inference results with the ground truth occupancy. The PIR-based inference clearly improved the inference accuracy by minimizing the miss time (\u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d in Fig. 8) in the CO2-based inference results. Fig. 9 shows the verification results for the occupancy inference algorithm. For clear visualization, the CO2 concentration in the living room, which was designated as the representative room, was plotted with a time step of 2 min. Because the PIR signal was acquired every second to detect the instantaneous movement of occupants, the aggregated PIR signals from each room for 2 min are plotted in the figure. As discussed earlier, the combination of CO2- and PIR-based occupancy inference provided accurate results close to the ground-truth occupancy. The verification result of each test day is summarized in Table 6 . Fig. 10 shows the accuracy of the occupancy inference during the measurement period as calculated with Eq. (6). In total, there were 720 inferred events in 1 day (the time step of the implemented inference algorithm was 2 min). There were more true positives and true negatives than false positives and false negatives, which indicates that the inference algorithm effectively detected the occupied and unoccupied states. The accuracy of the inference algorithm during the verification test was 83.5%\u201398.9% (average of 95.0%). The precision and recall were 85.5%\u201398.9% (average of 95.2%) and 92.4%\u201399.5% (average of 97.5%), respectively. Considering that the suggested algorithm is relatively simple and does not require a complicated machine learning technique, it can be efficiently used to infer the occupancy in a residential building even though there were some errors in the inference results. Potential error sources may have been when the indoor CO2 concentration dropped after occupant activities such as cooking (e.g., 19:00\u201320:00 in Fig. 9(a)), the CO2 concentration in the unoccupied state showed a very slow decay because of the tight envelope (e.g., 10:00\u201312:00 in Fig. 9(b)), or outdoor air was introduced by uncontrolled infiltration (e.g., 4:00\u20136:00 in Fig. 9(d)). The error can be minimized if the parameters of the inference algorithm (e.g., the reduction ratio of the occupancy probability or Kalman filter gain) are optimized according to the rate of change in an indoor environmental parameter such as the CO2 concentration. Further study is needed to optimize the parameters of the occupancy inference algorithm. 3.1.2 Derivation of the occupancy schedule Based on the verification test results, a standard occupancy schedule (average departure and arrival time) was extracted in order to apply the occupancy-related data (e.g. internal gains, lighting, heating operation) to building energy simulation. In this study, cumulative moving average(CMA) of the departure and arrival time was used because it is effective in generating a representative schedule while reflecting dynamic change of departure and arrival time. For the implementation of the CMA, recursive Eqs. (9) and (10) were used to decide the average departure and arrival time until current day, because the equations can yield the current average value using previous average value and newly added value, which can be simply implemented to the home controller with the reduced calculation load and low memory. The departure and arrival times were approximately 9:05 and 18:05, respectively, as shown in Fig. 11 . To simplify the following analysis, the residential building was assumed to be unoccupied from 9:00 to 18:00. (9) T D ( n ) ¯ = T D ( n − 1 ) ¯ + T D , n − T D ( n − 1 ) ¯ n (10) T A ( n ) ¯ = T A ( n − 1 ) ¯ + T A , n − T A ( n − 1 ) ¯ n where T D ( n ) ¯ is the cumulative moving average of the departure time until the nth day [h], T A ( n ) ¯ is the cumulative moving average of the arrival time until the nth day [h], T D, n is the departure time of the n-th day [h], and T A, n is the arrival time of the n-th day [h]. 3.2 Optimal start and stop control 3.2.1 Simulation results Fig. 12 shows the start and stop times determined with the optimal start and stop time curves, as discussed in Section 2.2 (Fig. 6 and Table 5). The lower part of Fig. 12 includes the outdoor air temperatures at 1:00 AM and 1:00 PM, which were used to determine the stop and start times, respectively. Thus, it provides meaningful information on the relation between the start and stop times and outdoor air temperature. The stop time tended to be delayed while the start time was advanced on relatively cold days. The opposite tendency was observed in relatively mild weather. Fig. 13 shows the simulation results for the mean room air temperature and gas consumption on a typical winter day. Without the optimal start and stop control, the room air temperature was maintained in the comfort zone even during the unoccupied period, which led to unnecessary heating energy consumption. Furthermore, thermal discomfort was caused when the occupants returned home because the room air temperature took some time to reach the comfort zone. In contrast, the optimal start and stop control made the heating system stop approximately 2 h earlier, which saved heating energy while maintaining thermal comfort until the occupants departed. In addition, thermal discomfort was reduced because the building was preheated before the occupants arrived. Although the simulation results showed that the optimal start and stop control is effective in reducing energy consumption and discomfort hour, the amount of reduction can be affected by the parameter setting of optimal start and stop time curves. For example, earlier stop time and/or later start time can provide more energy saving potential; however, it can increase the risk of thermal discomfort during the occupied period. Therefore, it needs to optimize the parameters of optimal start and stop time curves in terms of energy saving and thermal discomfort. 3.2.2 Optimization of the start and stop times Because the parameters of the optimal start and stop times can affect the heating energy consumption and thermal comfort, the optimal parameter values to minimize the heating energy consumption and thermal discomfort were investigated. Table 7 presents the assumed ranges of the parameters and their distributions. The eight parameters for determining the start and stop time curves were assumed to have uniform distributions because it was not known which time and temperature conditions minimized the energy consumption and thermal discomfort. The two parameters for reference times to read outdoor air temperatures were assumed to have discrete distributions (1:00 AM, 2:00 AM and 3:00 AM for TimeRef stop, 1:00 PM, 2:00 PM and 3:00 PM for TimeRef start) because it is reasonable to refer to weather data measured at the specific time. SimLab software [52] was used to perform parametric simulations to find the optimal parameter values. Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) was implemented for case sampling because it ensures that each parameter is represented in a fully stratified manner, no matter which parameters might turn out to be important [52]. The 400 simulation cases, or candidates for the optimal start and stop time curve, were generated based on the assumption in Table 7. The simulation cases can be considered as the coordinates for the optimal start and stop time curves, which are included in the boundary area illustrated in Fig. 14 . Fig. 14 shows the simulation cases for TimeRef stop=1:00 AM. Simulation cases for TimeRef stop=2:00 AM and 3:00 AM were not shown for clear visualization of the simulation cases. Based on the simulation cases, parametric simulations were conducted with jEPlus [53] to find the optimal start and stop time curve that would minimize the energy consumption and thermal discomfort. Fig. 15 shows all of the parametric simulation results in terms of the heating energy consumption and thermal discomfort time. Compared with the manual control (baseline), the optimal start and stop control resulted in wide ranges of energy consumption and discomfort time. Among the results, an appropriate alternative could be selected depending on the priority of control objective. For example, alternative 1 in Fig. 15 minimizes the heating energy while maintaining the thermal comfort. Alternative 2 minimizes the thermal discomfort without consuming more heating energy. Alternative 3 is suitable if thermal comfort is prioritized regardless of the heating energy consumption. Alternative 4 is suitable if minimizing the energy consumption is the priority. Fig. 16 shows the time variation of the room air temperature and heating rate for a typical winter day. The start and stop times were adjusted to achieve the control target of each alternative. Alternative 1 ensured thermal comfort during the occupied period even at the arrival time. Alternatives 2 and 3 provided better thermal comfort by delaying the stop time and advancing the start time compared with alternative 1. Alternative 4 minimized the energy consumption of the heating system by reducing the operation time; however, the thermal comfort was less than that of the other alternatives. Fig. 17 shows the parametric simulation results with regard to the annual room air temperature distribution to provide information on the overall improvement in thermal comfort. Compared with the baseline case, alternatives 1\u20133 reduced the temperature distribution below the comfort zone. In addition, the overall distribution was slightly lowered, which indicates that the optimal start and stop control prevents unnecessary over heating during the occupied period. Because alternative 4 was intended to maximize the energy performance regardless of decreased thermal comfort, the temperature distribution below the comfort zone showed a slight increase. 4 Discussions In this study, an occupancy inference method was developed that utilizes occupancy probability functions based on the CO2 concentration and PIR signal. The inference accuracy was 83.5%\u201398.9% (average of 95.0%), which is acceptable considering that the inference uses a relatively simple algorithm without a complicated learning process. Although the developed inference method was found to produce reliable results, it was verified against measurement data from one residential building with a relatively regular occupancy schedule. Therefore, the inference accuracy may be reduced for other residential buildings with a more irregular occupancy schedule. More occupancy data from various residential buildings needs to be collected in order to extend the applicability of the proposed occupancy inference method. It needs to be noted that the ground truth data obtained from the occupants\u2019 self-report may give rise to the inaccurate inference results due to the human errors, as discussed in the recent study [54]. Therefore, the methodology of acquiring the ground truth data needs to be improved using the more reliable method to minimize the human errors, for example, using an automatic recording system rather than manual recording method. In addition, it is difficult to apply the suggested method to a building with a continuously operating mechanical ventilation system; the system would prevent CO2 concentration buildup, which is a significant parameter for the occupancy probability function. In this case, the occupancy inference may be improved by using the differential CO2 concentration between the return and supply air, which would be proportional to the occupancy rate in the building. Further study is needed on whether the differential CO2 concentration can be used to estimate the occupancy in mechanically ventilated buildings. Natural ventilation can also affect the indoor CO2 concentration and thus the occupancy inference result. The inference accuracy can be improved if the inference method is complemented with window reed switches that can detect the open state of a window. The contact signal of a reed switch can be translated into the occupancy state because the window can be opened or closed only when an occupant is in the building. The present study showed that the thermal comfort and energy performance can be enhanced by optimal start and stop control based on the inferred occupancy schedule. A parametric simulation was performed to select the optimal start and stop times according to the priority of the control alternatives. With the optimal start and stop control, the heating energy consumption could be reduced by up to 3.1% (alternative 4 in Fig. 15) compared with the manual control. The thermal discomfort time during the heating season could be reduced from 62.5 h to 8.3 h (Alternative 3 in Fig. 15). This study was limited because the selected optimal start and stop time curves may not be appropriate if building characteristics such as the insulation level, thermal mass, and air tightness are changed. In order to derive generalized optimal start and stop time curves that can be applied to various buildings, the above building characteristics need to be included in the parametric simulation. For practical application of generalized optimal start and stop time curves, further study is needed on developing regression equations to determine the optimal start and stop times based on the thermal characteristics of a building. In addition, further studies should be conducted to embed the parametric simulation tool in the commercial controller in order to apply the optimal start and stop control to the real-time heating system controls. For now, two steps can be considered to implement the optimal heating start and stop control. First, the average occupancy schedule is determined using the suggested inference algorithm. In this step, the average departure and arrival times need to be updated every day in order to apply the daily variation of occupancy schedule to the real-time control of heating system. Second, the parameters of heating controller (optimum start and stop time curve) are reset based on the results of parametric simulations that can be conducted by a remote simulation server. 5 Conclusions In this study, an occupancy inference method was developed and applied to the optimal start and stop control of a radiant floor heating system. The inference method was derived from the occupancy probability according to the indoor CO2 concentration and PIR signal. The probability was estimated by applying different probability reduction ratios depending on the derivative of the CO2 concentration and aggregated PIR signal. The developed inference algorithm was validated against the real occupancy data of a residential building. The inference accuracy was 83.5%\u201398.9% (average of 95%), which is acceptable for application to residential buildings. The inferred occupancy data were used to extract a standard occupancy schedule, which was used as input data for the simulation of the optimal heating start and stop control. A simulation model was developed with the optimal start and stop time curves to minimize the heating energy consumption and thermal discomfort during the heating season. Parametric simulations with jEPlus were conducted to find the optimal start and stop time curves for the investigated residential building. The optimal start and stop control reduced the heating energy consumption by up to 3.1% and the thermal discomfort time from 62.5 h to 8.3 h. Although the developed inference method provides acceptable accuracy and can be successfully applied to optimal heating start and stop control, it was verified with occupancy data collected from a residential building with a relatively regular occupancy schedule. In order to extend the applicability, more occupancy data from various residential buildings need to be collected. In addition, further study is necessary to investigate whether the inference method can be used in mechanically ventilated buildings. The optimal start and stop time curves can depend on building characteristics such as the insulation level, thermal mass, and airtightness. Therefore, a future research topic is to derive generalized optimal start and stop time curves that can be applied to various buildings.

        "dc:description": "Occupancy-based heating control is important for not only achieving thermal comfort but also reducing the heating energy consumption of residential buildings. In this study, an occupancy inference method was developed for the optimal start and stop control of radiant floor heating systems. The basic concept of the inference is to combine the occupancy probabilities based on the indoor CO2 concentration and passive infrared (PIR) signals. The probability is estimated by applying different probability reduction ratios depending on the derivative of the CO2 concentration and aggregated PIR signals. In a validation experiment, the results showed that the developed algorithm can predict the occupancy with an accuracy of 83.5%\u201398.9%. The inferred occupancy data were used to determine the optimal heating start and stop control to improve energy saving performance and thermal comfort. Parametric simulations were conducted with jEPlus to find the optimal start and stop times. This optimal start and stop control was found to reduce the heating energy consumption by up to 3.1% and thermal discomfort times from 62.5 h to 8.3 h.",
