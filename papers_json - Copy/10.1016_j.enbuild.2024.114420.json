The optimization of HVAC system control affects the thermal comfort of building environment and air-conditioning energy consumption. However, most existing studies concentrate on human thermal comfort and neglects to incorporate air-conditioning energy consumption required to establish a controlled indoor thermal environment within the policy, which results in air-conditioning system high energy consumption. This paper suggests an indoor temperature intelligent control method based on thermal comfort and energy consumption of air-conditioning, and the TD3 algorithm is employed as an intelligent control algorithm to obtain the optimal setpoint that maximizes the joint benefit of the occupant\u2019s thermal comfort and the energy saving rate of air-conditioning system. The air-conditioning indoor temperature intelligent control model based on TD3 algorithm is trained by using the experimental data, and the method is simulated in TRNSYS simulation software to corroborate the efficacy and energy saving rate of the method. The results indicate that the indoor temperature intelligent control model based on thermal comfort and energy consumption of air-conditioning has less optimal adjustment of indoor temperature setpoints, which is more stable for the air-conditioning system and can satisfy the thermal comfort demand at the initial control stage to prevent significant fluctuations in human thermal sensation compared to the linear control method based on thermal sensation and the fuzzy control method based on thermal sensation. Besides, the average daily energy consumption can be reduced by 6.54% and 3.37% respectively, when compared to the linear control method based on thermal sensation and the fuzzy control method based on thermal sensation.

Establish an indoor environment that is both comfortable and healthy for indoor users is the central objective of the heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system, which in turn improve their working efficiency and quality of life [2]. The HVAC system typically constitutes over 50 % of the aggregate energy outlay in architectural structures [3]. Improving the indoor thermal environment and efficiently reducing operational energy outlays of HVAC systems can be achieved by optimizing the control of HVAC system. Hence, it is crucial to investigate and devise optimal control method for building HVAC systems. Currently, most buildings use the temperature setpoints based method to regulate indoor temperatures. However, since the dynamic thermal comfort needs of humans are influenced by many factors, including environmental conditions, clothing conditions, and activity status, maintaining a constant indoor temperature is insufficient to satisfy these needs. To improve this situation, numerous studies have incorporated real-time human thermal sensation into the operational policy of HVAC systems to achieve optimal control [4\u20136]. However, this method requires obtaining precise thermal sensation information from individuals. Chaudhuri et al. [7,8] have used physiological parameters to forecast the thermal comfort state and introduced a model for assessing the thermal comfort of individuals which utilizing skin temperature and the temperature gradient surrounding the body as key determinants. For the past few years, numerous investigations have commenced the monitoring of facial cutaneous temperature of individuals employing infrared thermography, subsequently, predict human thermal sensation through specific algorithms and integrating it into the regulation of the indoor thermal environment [9,10]. Researchers have investigated the monitor physiological parameters and predict human thermal sensations by the utilization of wearable devices to optimize HVAC system control, the results of these studies have demonstrated that taking human thermal sensations into account during the regulation process of air-conditioning systems can effectively improve user thermal comfort [11\u201313]. However, the above studies focused on satisfying human thermal comfort, omitted the air-conditioning systems energy consumption in the regulation process, which may result in experiencing undue energy consumption. Therefore, we should consider the operational energy consumed in the regulation process of the system for air conditioning, which requires real-time prediction of air-conditioning energy consumption. Enhancing the energy efficiency of buildings is feasible through implementing energy-saving operations for air-conditioning systems, which is particularly important owing to the increasing energy consumption in buildings [14]. Recently, researchers have begun to carry out research on prediction of air-conditioning energy consumption. Cao et al. [15] designed a model that integrates spatial characteristics of time-series data has been developed for predicting short-term energy consumption in an educational building, and the findings indicated that the integrated energy prediction model exhibited a reduction in Root mean square error (RMSE) and Mean absolute error (MAE) values ranging from 13.64 %\u201334.55 % and 10.25 %\u201330.54 % respectively in comparison to alternative energy prediction models with higher prediction precision. Wei et al. [16] suggested an air-conditioning system energy prediction model which employing ensemble model and feed-forward neural network and extreme learning machine, and the findings indicated that incorporating occupancy as an input variable enhances the precision of energy consumption predictions through the neural network model. Sendra-Arranz et al. [17] suggested a prediction model for HVAC system energy consumption utilizing Long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks which used in a solar residence achieving autarky, and the outcomes indicated that the model's normalized root mean square errors (NRMSE) was 0.13 and 0.052 for predictions 24 h and 1 h in advance, respectively. Nonetheless, most of the existing studies are limited to predicting the air-conditioning systems energy consumption within the subsequent 24 h at an hourly granularity and necessitate a significant amount of input feature parameters. Consequently, the existing operational strategies cannot be optimized in time based on energy consumption prediction, posing difficulties in augmenting the energy efficiency of individual control steps. In this paper, utilizing LSTM neural networks improves the accuracy and stability of a short-term energy consumption prediction model tailored to air-conditioning systems [14]. Drawing from the discussion above, optimizing the buildings energy efficiency relies heavily on predicting for air-conditioning systems energy consumption, and with the rapid growth in machine learning algorithms and their application in HVAC control domain, which aids in enhancing the predictions' accuracy and stability of the prediction. Reinforcement learning (RL) control represents a model-free control approach wherein the system state obtained from feedback and rewards are acquired via interactions with the environment, enabling the updating of control actions on the environment. [18,19]. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) widely used in the field of HVAC system control in buildings. Lei et al. [20] proposed an occupant-centered multivariate control framework based on DRL, which was shown to 14 % decrease in cooling energy consumption while enhancing the total thermal acceptability by 11 %. Qiu et al. [21] suggested a RL approach devoid of model-free utilizing the Q-learning algorithm for controlling a building chilled water system, and the results indicate that the method saves 11 % system energy consumption during the initial cooling season compared to control method based on the basic control algorithm. Anh Tuan Nguyen et al. [22] developed and proposed a strategic control learning framework for HVAC systems using a deep reinforcement learning approach, which reduces energy consumption by 2 % to 14 % and significantly enhances temperature comfort metrics by over 6 % to 52 % compared to traditional methods. Cui et al. [23] proposed a hierarchical HVAC optimal control method combining soft Actor-Critic and hybrid search optimization, which achieves good indoor air quality in multiple zones while saving an average of 35.1 % and 43.6 % energy compared to the Proportional method and the P2S-DCV method, respectively. Liang et al. [24] presented the design of an intelligent comfort control system for HVAC that combines human learning with minimum power control strategies, and the simulation results show that the system can provide a higher level of comfort compared with the conventional temperature controller, and the cooling capacity can be reduced by 3 kW h compared with the normal constant air volume control within 12 h; if the COP of the HVAC system is 2.8, about 1 kW h of energy can be saved. Valladares et al. [25] suggested a control approach utilizing DRL that concurrently considers indoor air quality, energy control and indoor thermal comfort in buildings, and finding indicated that the control approach outperform Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) than the current control method and can reduce the CO2 level by 10 % alongside a 4 % to 5 % decrease in energy consumption. The above study shows that the rapid development of DRL and its application in the field of HVAC has improved the indoor thermal environment and concurrent reductions in energy consumption within air-conditioning systems. In summary, by introducing human thermal sensation and air-conditioning operational energy consumption within real-time automatic control processes for air-conditioning systems, and then applying DRL methods to regulate the indoor temperature setpoints, it becomes feasible to minimize energy consumption while meeting human thermal comfort needs. Therefore, this study suggested an indoor temperature intelligent control method based on thermal comfort and energy consumption of air-conditioning, which using the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient (TD3) algorithm as an intelligent control algorithm, quantifying the indoor personnel's thermal sensation through a model for predicting thermal sensation, and employing a LSTM neural network air-conditioning energy prediction model for the air-conditioning systems projected energy consumption to attain the optimal control over the indoor thermal environment. The air-conditioning indoor temperature control model based on TD3 algorithm is trained using experimental data. Subsequently, the control method is tested with TRNSYS simulations to validate the validity and energy-saving of the method. The subsequent section in this study follows the subsequent structure. Section 2 presents the indoor temperature intelligent control method based on thermal comfort and energy consumption and simulation process; Section 3 delves into the analysis of the outcomes from the experimentation; in Section 4, the outcomes from the experimentation are discussed and along with a review of the limitations of this paper; Section 5 outlines the primary conclusions drawn from the study. 2 Methods 2.1 Analysis of indoor temperature regulation process under the collective influence of both thermal comfort and air-conditioning systems energy consumption There exists a range of air-conditioning temperatures in alignment with the human thermal comfort region, and any air-conditioning temperature within this range can be considered comfortable. Existing research has indicated that appropriately increasing the setpoint for indoor temperature in air-conditioning within the human thermal comfort range effectively decrease the operational energy consumed and concurrently ensuring user thermal comfort [26,27]. There exists a temperature value that facilitates the attainment of optimal human thermal comfort within the indoor thermal environment, when the indoor temperature descends below this value, in conjunction with the escalation of indoor temperature, the air-conditioning system energy saving rate and the occupant's thermal comfort will increase; Conversely, raising the indoor temperature above this point will further improve the energy saving rate but will diminish thermal comfort of the occupants to a some extent. Rasing the indoor temperature within the comfort range for the optimal human thermal comfort value has less impact on human thermal comfort and improves the energy saving rate. Therefore, the indoor temperature setpoint should consider both the occupant's thermal comfort and the energy saving rate of the air-conditioning system. Initially, the indoor temperature should be adjusted to ensure that the human physiological state resides within the comfort range. Subsequently, the indoor temperature setpoint was appropriately increased, in order to maximize the collective benefits of human thermal comfort and the energy saving rate at a certain indoor temperature. Then the temperature setpoint obtained at this time satisfies human thermal comfort requirements while attains a more favorable energy saving rate. This paper introduces TD3 algorithm into the policy for controlling the indoor temperature and further investigates the air-conditioning indoor temperature intelligent control method. The aim is further to explore the potential for the energy saving rate within the air conditioning system built upon the premise of satisfying human thermal comfort. 2.2 Overview of deep reinforcement learning method 2.2.1 Reinforcement learning algorithm As artificial intelligence technology advances, The RL algorithm situated within the realm of machine learning, constitutes a computational method for decision-making in conditions of uncertainty [28], which has demonstrated excellent decision-making ability in engineering problems. All RL problems can be expressed as exemplars of Markov Decision Processes [29], depicting the process through which an intelligent agent guide its actions by interacting with the environment to acquire rewards. The Markov decision process is delineated by a quintuple ( S , A , R , P , γ ) , where S denotes the state representing the observable information about environment before decision is made by the intelligent agent and A denotes the action decided by the intelligent agent in line with the observed environmental state; R denotes the reward, typically a mathematical function of the objective to be optimized, indicating the size of reward that can be obtained for the decision by the intelligent agent. The agent's decision-making is optimized towards greater reward. P denotes probability of state transition, representing the likelihood distribution of the environment from state s t to state s t+1 when action at is executed in a specific state. γ is discount factor that facilitating the mitigation of feedback delay in the interaction between the intelligent agent and the environment, which can balance the short-term optimization goal and the long-term optimization goal by discounting rewards over a series of sequential steps to obtain the accumulation of cumulative rewards over multiple future steps. The policy π establishes the mapping relation from state S to action A. The optimal policy is sought to be determined by RL as its primary objective, which maximizes the cumulative reward by the utilization of a Markov decision process. While most RL only can solve decision-making problems in discrete action spaces, the use of the Actor-Critic framework enables RL algorithms to be extended to action spaces of a continuous nature. The Actor-Critic framework is a classical framework in RL, which comprises two components: the actor policy network μ and the critic policy network Q. The actor and critic networks may differ in accordance with the algorithm utilized. The critic policy network Q serves the purpose of appraising the current action and computing the function assessing the actional value. The actor policy network μ refined by leveraging feedback from the critic network and outputs the actional value of decision via the vector representing the input state. This calculation relies on the maximum value determined by the critic policy network. Within the Actor-Critic framework, Equation (1) depicts the utilization of the Bellman equation in updating the Q network. (1) Δ Q t = r t + γ · Q s t + 1 , μ s t + 1 | θ μ | θ Q - Q s t , a t | θ Q The actor network undergoes updating in accordance with Eq. (2): (2) ∇ θ μ μ = ∇ a Q s t , a | θ Q | a = μ ( s t ) ∇ θ μ μ s t | θ μ Wherein θ Q , θ μ , represent the parameters of the critic policy network and actor policy network respectively. Given that the entire formulation exclusively involves gradient calculations regarding the parameters within the actor network, this computation enables the actor network to output continuous actions while determining the action yielding the maximum Q-network output. 2.2.2 TD3 algorithm The TD3 algorithm belongs to the category of DRL algorithms designed for continuous action spaces, operating within an Actor-Critic framework, which can collect experience with arbitrary behavioral policies and then train both the actor policy network and critic policy network through experience replay. The TD3 algorithm architecture is show in the upper part of Fig. 1 . Compared with other RL algorithm, TD3 optimizes both actor and critic policy network, resolves the issue associated with Q-value overestimation, and is commonly used to solve continuous control problems with excellent performance. It has the following three primary advantages: 1) Network architecture optimization: the actor policy network output actions are assessed by two critic target networks. The aim is to address the Q overestimation problem by selecting the minimum Q-value from critic target networks 1 and 2, as depicted in Equation (3): (3) y t = r ( s t , a t ) + γ min i = 1 , 2 Q θ i \u2032 s t + 1 , π ϕ s t + 1 L Q θ i = E μ y t - Q θ i s t , a t Q θ i 2 , i = 1 , 2 Wherein y t represents the Q-value obtained from critic target network. Q θ 1 and Q θ 2 denote the values derived from the function representing action-value yielded by the critic policy network, respectively. L is loss function, which is utilized for updating the weight parameters of the critic policy network through minimization of the loss function. 2) Update method optimization: employed the delayed update method for Q-value updates. Specifically, the actor policy network undergoes an update after several iterations of updating the critic policy network. This can improve the stability of network learning and prevent certain incorrect updates. Simultaneously, the network weight parameters are updated according to the parameter soft update method, which is shown in Equation (4). (4) θ Q \u2032 ← τ θ Q \u2032 + 1 - τ θ Q \u2032 θ μ \u2032 ← τ θ μ \u2032 + 1 - τ θ μ \u2032 Wherein θ Q \u2032 , θ μ \u2032 , represent the parameters of the critic target network and actor target network, respectively, and τ represent the smoothing factor. 3) Policy smoothing regularization: enhancing the algorithm's robustness involves smoothing the target policy by adding truncated normally distributed noise that the target action is clipped to the action range. The Equation is as follows: (5) y t = r s t , a t + γ min Q θ i s t + 1 , π ϕ s t + 1 + ε (6) ε ∼ c l i p N 0 , σ , - c , c Wherein ε represent the stochastic noise incorporated into the action. The stochastic noise must be cut off within a specific extent to guarantee that the output value of the target policy network falls within a specific extent. 2.3 Air-conditioning indoor temperature intelligent control model based on TD3 algorithm In fact, the regulation of air-conditioning indoor temperature is a decision-making problem for multi-objective optimization in a continuous action space. Simultaneously, the interaction process between the air-conditioning control system and indoor environment through the indoor temperature setpoint is in line with the basic characteristics of the Markov decision process, and TD3 algorithm is selected as the intelligent control algorithm to realize the intelligent regulation of air-conditioning indoor temperature setpoint in view of this situation. 2.3.1 Setting of model parameters In constructing the air-conditioning indoor temperature intelligent control model based on TD3 algorithm, we define the controller of air-conditioning which includes TD3 algorithm as intelligent Agent; the thermal environment within the building's interior is regarded as the environment E; the state parameter S is comprised of the human thermal sensation and the real-time air-conditioning system energy consumption. The prediction model for human thermal sensation is employed to compute the human thermal sensation [30], and the air-conditioning system real-time energy consumption is predicted by the short-term energy consumption prediction model [14]; the reward R for the intelligent control model of air-conditioning based on the TD3 algorithm which is determined by the composite assessment encompassing of human thermal comfort and the energy saving rate, and depicted in Fig. 1 is its overall control model. 2.3.2 Setting of reward function In RL algorithms, the existence of reward function will guide the direction in which the network optimization is carried out and determine the effectiveness of the policy implementation. Therefore, the formulation of the reward function necessitates design aligned with the specific of the research problem. This study aims to recognize the indoor temperature setpoint that satisfies the user's thermal comfort and has better energy saving rate by TD3 algorithm. Consequently, two primary indicators are considered when designing the reward function: thermal comfort and energy saving rate. The weight parameter is set on the basis of the reward to evaluate the significance of both the control policy, and the reward obtained at time t can be characterized as follows: (7) R total = ω 1 × R Comfort + ω 2 × R Energy Wherein R total represents the total reward, R Comfort represents the reward for thermal comfort, R Energy represents the reward for the energy saving rate, ω 1 and ω 2 denote the weights of thermal comfort and energy saving rate rewards, respectively, the weighting parameter is appropriately adjusted in the range of 0 to 1 depending on the importance given by the manager to thermal comfort and energy saving rate of the air-conditioning system, while ensuring that the sum of the two weighting parameters is 1. In the research work of this paper, however, in order to balance the thermal comfort of the user and the energy saving rate of the air-conditioning system, both weighting values are set to 0.5. Thermal comfort refers to indoor temperature that satisfies the comfort of most user. When the human sensation is close to 0 value, it represents higher thermal comfort for individuals. Therefore, configuring the thermal comfort reward setting should aim to better satisfy the user's thermal comfort requirements in regulating the indoor thermal environment. EN ISO-7730 divides the indoor required thermal environment into three classes, A, B, and C [31]: where class A is −0.2 < PMV < +0.2; class B is −0.5 < PMV < +0.5. Therefore, the reward stage is divided based on the class B when designing the reward function for thermal comfort. The maximum reward is given when the human thermal sensation satisfies class B. If the thermal sensation is outside of class B, the reward is greatly reduced and accompanied by a penalty, and. Equation (8) represents the reward for thermal comfort. (8) R Comfort = a 1 - b 1 × TS ∧ c 1 TS < = 0.5 a 2 - b 2 × TS ∧ c 2 0.5 < TS < = 3 Wherein R Comfort represents the thermal comfort reward and TS represents human thermal sensation. a 1 , a 2 , b 1 , b 2 , c 1 , c 2 represent model parameters, respectively. Based on the practical problem discussed in this study and the range of thermal sensations of the personnel, the corrected thermal comfort reward obtained is shown in (9). (9) R Comfort = 10 - 3.16 × TS ∧ 2.5 TS < = 0.5 10 - 3.54 × TS ∧ 1.5 0.5 < TS < = 3 Wherein defines the thermal sensation range of personnel as TS ∈ [−3,3]; Maximum thermal comfort reward obtained by the system is 10 when the user's TS value is 0. However, as the user's TS value moves further away from the 0 value, the maximum thermal comfort penalty obtained by the system is −8.4. The reward for energy saving rate primarily pertains to the recognition of energy consumption reduction achieved by the air-conditioning system, the lower the air-conditioning system's energy consumption, the more pronounced its energy saving rate becomes concurrently. Therefore, the reward for energy saving rate is set so that the air-conditioning system in creating an indoor thermal environment with less energy consumption, and Equation (10) illustrates the reward for energy saving rate. (10) R Energy = e - d × E n e r g y Wherein R Energy is reward for energy saving rate, the expected energy consumption of the system for air-conditioning is denoted as Energy. e and d represent model parameters. Since the expected energy consumption range in this study is Energy ∈ [0.5218,0.5297], and for the sake of reducing the dominant effect due to the excessive variation of a single reward, it is necessary to map the energy saving rate reward to the dimension of same magnitude as the thermal comfort reward. Considering the energy consumption reward range as well as the reward dimensions, the modified energy saving rate reward can be expressed as (11). (11) R Energy = 2527 - 4800 × E n e r g y With this parameter setting, the system's energy saving rate ranges from −15.66 to 22.24. Therefore, the range of total system reward under the combined influence which considered reward for thermal comfort and reward for energy saving rate is −12.01 ∼ 15.21. 2.4 Training of the model After constructing the air-conditioning indoor temperature intelligent control model based on the TD3 algorithm, it is also imperative to attain the optimal policy by training the TD3 algorithm. The learning process of the air-conditioning indoor temperature intelligent control model based on the TD3 algorithm is depicted in Fig. 2 : After the air-conditioning indoor temperature intelligent control model based on TD3 algorithm learns the optimal policy, the air-conditioning indoor temperature intelligent control method based on TD3 algorithm can be implemented to the air-conditioning system for the regulating indoor thermal environment. During the course of adjusting the indoor thermal environment, the control system can predict the user's human thermal sensation by leveraging the human physiological parameters obtained from the sensors and air-conditioning systems real-time energy consumption from historical energy consumption, equipment operating parameters and indoor environmental parameters obtained, and then obtain the indoor temperature setpoint of air-conditioning with the maximum reward in the current state. The control system then controls the indoor thermal environment in accordance with the indoor temperature setpoint and runs to next control stage. The air-conditioning indoor temperature intelligent control model based on TD3 algorithm implemented in the Pytorch environment of Python 3.8. The data used for training is a collation of previous experimental data [32]. The settings of hyperparameters in model training are shown in Table 1 . 2.5 Model simulation To corroborate the efficacy of the proposed the air-conditioning indoor temperature intelligent control method based on TD3 algorithm with greater assurance, we conduct the simulation for this method. The simulation in this study was carried out in TRNSYS 18 software environment. A 3D simulation model of the artificial environment laboratory was built in Sketchup software, and the Fig. 3 displays its spatial layout and model parameters. The parameters for thermal in the simulation model were configured using the TRNbuild program within TRNSYS, while the air-conditioning system was built in Simulation Studio program within TRNSYS. Finally, the room model after setting the parameters is added to the air-conditioning system for indoor temperature control. Simulated building models are different from experimental buildings, the simulated building model used in this paper is only to verify the effectiveness of the proposed the air-conditioning indoor temperature intelligent control method based on TD3 algorithm, and it is also feasible to use other simulated building models. The control method proposed in this paper is written in Python code, and TRNSYS invokes Python through the Type-169 module. Fig. 4 shows the connection between the modules in the simulation system. The simulation was conducted spanning from 1st August to 1st September under the meteorological conditions of Changsha City. The simulation operates with a time step of 1 min, each simulation time is for one day, and the indoor temperature control cycle is 15 min, which means the control system adjusts the indoor temperature every 15 min. The air-conditioning indoor temperature intelligent control method based on TD3 is compared with the indoor temperature linear control method based on thermal sensation [33] and indoor temperature fuzzy control method based on thermal sensation [32] in the simulation to confirm the efficacy of the proposed more robustly in this study. Only the indoor temperature setpoint is changed under all three control methods. The two methods mentioned above used for comparative validation corrects the indoor temperature by considering human thermal sensation since the current setpoint. Thus, the initial temperature setpoint for both method is 25 °C, and all the rest of the air-conditioning equipment follows the same operational policy. 3 Results There exists an air-conditioning indoor temperature intelligent control method based on TD3 algorithm, for which simulation is carried out to collect indoor and outdoor environmental parameters and the power consumption of each device of the air-conditioning system, and a total of 334,800 sets of data are collected, and at the same time, during the training process of the model, the rewards obtained by the model are recorded in order to judge the degree of completion of the training of the model. For this study, the rewards obtained by the model are different when the same set temperature is reached at different initial indoor temperature settings, and this reward may exceed the reward range at final convergence, and if the reward range at final convergence is set as the termination condition, it may lead to the model jumping out of the training in the early stage of training, and at this time the model does not obtain the optimal reward strategy. Therefore, in this study, we set a constant number of training times to judge whether the training is completed by finally judging the degree of convergence of the model's reward curve. After the training indoor temperature intelligent control model of the air-conditioning based on TD3 algorithm is completed, the proposed method is applicable for real-time management of the indoor thermal environment. To assess viability of the proposed control method, the 19th of August, which is the hottest day of the outdoor climatic conditions, is selected as a typical working day for the comparative analysis. The comparative analyses of the performance of the indoor temperature control, the thermal comfort as well as the air-conditioning system energy consumption are implemented under the three control methods. 3.1 Training results Throughout the DRL algorithm training phase, the model's training progress is assessed by observing the convergence of the reward curve. Fig. 5 shows that average reward curve during the model training phase. Aligned with the configuration of the reward function, the model can attain rewards within the range of −12.01 ∼ 15.21. As depicted in Fig. 5, the average reward curve begins to converge for the first time to the range of 11.4 ∼ 12.4 upon reaching 1000 training times. As the number of training times continues to increase, the range of convergence of the average reward is not further narrowed, nevertheless, the average reward obtained by the model did not converge to a singular value, which is due to varying electricity consumption levels caused by setting same indoor temperature setpoint with different indoor temperature conditions, and therefore the optimal reward of the model is different in different room states. This indicates that the training of the indoor temperature intelligent control model of air-conditioning based on TD3 algorithm has been completed, and the model has learned the optimal policy. 3.2 Indoor temperature control performance analysis Fig. 6 shows the temperature change curves for indoor and outdoor environments under three control methods. In the morning, the linear control method based on thermal sensation makes the indoor thermal environment stable by optimizing the indoor temperature setpoint. Room No.1 maintains a stable indoor temperature of 27.8 °C, while Room No.2 sustains a temperature of 28.2 °C. The difference in stable temperature between the two rooms is since the control method no longer optimizes and adjusts the indoor temperature setpoint when human thermal sensation meets the range of −0.5 ∼ 0.5. However, the indoor user\u2019s thermal sensation may be different. After optimizing the indoor temperature setpoints with the fuzzy control method, the indoor temperature based on thermal sensation of both rooms stabilized at 28.2 °C. In the afternoon, the stable indoor temperature of both rooms maintained at 28.2 °C using the linear control method based on thermal sensation, and the stable indoor of both rooms also maintained using the fuzzy control method based on thermal sensation. This paper proposed the air-conditioning indoor temperature intelligent control method based on TD3 algorithm can be used to set the indoor temperature setpoint with the maximum comprehensive benefit according to the present indoor state at the air-conditioning system initial operation, following that regulate the indoor thermal environment in accordance with this indoor temperature setpoint. Therefore, the indoor thermal environment can achieve stability with a small amount of regulation in the morning and afternoon, and the indoor air temperatures of the two rooms can be maintained at 28.6 °C. The proposed control method is based on real-time regulation of indoor temperature setpoints taking into account the thermal comfort of the personnel and the energy consumption of the air-conditioning, which requires the prediction of the short-term energy consumption of the air-conditioning system in advance, however, most of the existing studies are unable to predict the energy consumption of the air-conditioning system for the next control step (e.g., 15 min) at a given operating parameter when the indoor parameters change. This means that the operation strategy of the air-conditioning system cannot be optimized based on the predicted energy consumption in sufficient time to improve the energy efficiency of each control step. Suroor M. Dawood et al. [34] proposed the hybrid DP-NARX-RL controller, the algorithm that efficiently handles the long term predicted continuous state-action space by tuning the HVAC system actuators to achieve optimal control of the continuous actions in each control cycle while the controller acquires the next continuous state space based on the executed actions, the results of case study 1 show that both DP-RL and DP-NARX-RL methods maintain indoor comfort levels within the desired range, but DP-NARX-RL provides more stable indoor temperatures and its daily energy consumption is reduced by 20.5 % and 6.5 % compared to RL and DP-RL, respectively. The short-term energy consumption prediction model for air-conditioning systems based on LSTM neural networks used in this paper provides energy consumption information for optimally adjusting the system's operation strategy in real time within a single control duration (e.g., 15 min) by predicting the energy consumption of the air-conditioning system at the next control duration (e.g., 15 min). The indoor thermal environment can be regulated to satisfy the occupant's needs by optimizing the temperature setpoint a few different times. The air-conditioning indoor temperature intelligent control method based on TD3 algorithm has the least optimization adjustment of indoor temperature setpoint which requires only one or two optimizations. This indicates that the proposed method is more stable for air-conditioning system. After the indoor air temperature achieves stability, the indoor temperature under the proposed control method exceeds that of the two other control methods, which implies that the proposed control method has potential to save energy. 3.3 Thermal comfort analysis of personnel The simulated variations in human thermal sensation are represented by the thermal sensation curves corresponding to the actual person in different temperature conditions, and this correspondence was obtained from previous experiments [33]. In Fig. 7 , the absence of human thermal sensation recordings at 8:00 and 14:00 is due to the air-conditioning system has just begun to regulate the indoor thermal environment which has not yet reached a stable state. Fig. 7 illustrates the users' thermal sensation can be stabilized within the range of −0.5 and 0.5, i.e., B-level thermal comfort environment under all three indoor control methods [31]. This indicates that each of the three control methods is capable of fulfilling the users' thermal comfort requirements. During the pre-optimization process indoor temperature setpoint, the indoor human thermal sensation experiences significant fluctuations under the linear control method before finally stabilizing in the thermal comfort region. The indoor thermal sensation under the fuzzy control method is increasing to the region for thermal comfort. These two different optimization processes cause constant changes in human thermal sensation, which can negatively impact thermal comfort to some extent. The human thermal sensation of indoor users under both control methods is approaching 0 (neutral). However, in the morning of Room No.1, the human thermal sensation under the linear control method based on thermal sensation is close to −0.5, which is the reason why the indoor air temperature of Room No.1 in the indoor temperature control analysis is stable at 27.8 °C. The air-conditioning indoor temperature intelligent control method based TD3 algorithm can satisfy the user's thermal demand at the early stage of control, thus avoiding significant fluctuations in human thermal sensation. Additionally, the final stabilized human thermal sensation slightly exceeds the other two control methods, which indicates that it is feasible to moderately increase the temperature value while still ensuring human thermal comfort. 3.4 Analysis of system energy consumption The air-conditioning system daily electricity consumption consists mainly of the energy consumption of individual components (e.g., chilling station equipment, like chillers and circulating water pumps, and unit equipment of air-conditioning, like supply and return fans). Fig. 8 shows the energy consumption around the hottest day of the outdoor climatic conditions. From the Fig. 8, the energy consumption under the three methods is reduced in turn by comparing the linear control method based on thermal sensation with the fuzzy control method based on thermal sensation and the air-conditioning indoor temperature intelligent control method based on TD3 algorithm. The indoor temperature at final stabilization of the room is the same for the first two methods. However, linear control method based on thermal sensation has greater fluctuations in the indoor temperature setpoint during the optimization process, which will increase the operational energy consumption. Moreover, both the linear control method based on thermal sensation and the fuzzy control method based on thermal sensation only adjust the indoor thermal environment to within the range of human thermal comfort, and do not take into account the energy consumption of the air-conditioning system. In contrast, the air-conditioning indoor temperature intelligent control method based on TD3 algorithm can improve the energy saving rate of the air-conditioning system while ensuring the thermal comfort of the personnel. Therefore, compared to the other two control methods, the control method achieves a slightly higher personnel thermal sensation, and also avoids the energy consumption generated by the change in the air-conditioning indoor temperature setting value when the personnel thermal sensation changes drastically. The control method put forward in study can obtain a reasonable indoor temperature setpoint faster than the other two methods, and therefore the air-conditioning system has lower operational energy consumption. Fig. 9 demonstrates the air-conditioning system energy saving rate under various indoor temperature control methods, from which the energy saving rate under the air-conditioning indoor temperature intelligent control method based on the TD3 algorithm increases as the average outdoor air temperature rises. Fig. 9 and Table 2 are both comparisons of the air-conditioning indoor temperature intelligent control method based on TD3 algorithm proposed in this paper with the fuzzy control method based on thermal sensation and the linear control method based on thermal sensation, so the reference is the same. The energy saving rate data in Table 2 is a more visual representation of Fig. 9. Table 2 shows that the air-conditioning indoor temperature intelligent control method based on TD3 algorithm can reduce energy consumption by up to 9.11 %. The lowest reduction is 4.82 %, and the average reduction is 6.54 % compared to the linear control method based on thermal sensation. The air-conditioning indoor temperature intelligent control method based on TD3 algorithm can reduce energy consumption by up to 4.66 %. The lowest reduction is 2.33 %, and the average reduction is 3.37 % compared to the fuzzy control method based on thermal sensation. 4 Discussion To reduce energy consumption of air-conditioning system whereas preserving the occupants\u2019 thermal comfort, this paper appropriately increases the indoor temperature setpoint to achieve optimizing the control of indoor thermal environment through HVAC system, while ensuring that human thermal comfort falls within the comfort range. This study holds significant practical implications for enhancing indoor thermal comfort in buildings, contributing to energy-saving and emission reduction efforts by minimizing the energy consumption. It promotes application of intelligent technology in the field of construction and contributes to a practical path to realize the Carbon peaking and neutralization goal within the domain of construction. Balancing the fulfillment of human thermal comfort needs with the reduction of associated energy consumption poses a classic optimization challenge, necessitating intelligent system design [35]. To tackle this challenge, Gao et al. [36] recommended a control method based on deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) that that considers both energy consumption and human thermal comfort and showed that the method can achieve a 4.31 % reduction in HVAC energy consumption concurrently with a 13.6 % improvement in occupant thermal comfort. Schito et al. [37] conducted a multi-goal optimization study of air-conditioning control in a museum taking into account the integrity of the artwork, the visitors' comfort, and the energy consumption. The outcomes indicated that all three aspects were improved. However, to maintain the integrity of the artwork, it is necessary to optimize thermal comfort and air-conditioning energy consumption by keeping the temperature lower than the visitor comfort level. Therefore, this optimization is rather limited and maintains indoor temperatures within the range of 22 to 25 °C. This paper focuses on optimizing the thermal comfort and the energy consumption and proposed an air-conditioning indoor temperature intelligent control method based on TD3 algorithm which increases the temperature moderately on the basis that the indoor thermal environment satisfies human thermal comfort at the early stage of the control period. The method obtains reasonable indoor temperature setpoint faster and maintains indoor temperature at 28.6 °C, which makes the indoor environment more comfortable and the operation energy consumption lower. As the average outdoor air temperature increases, the energy saving rate under the air-conditioning indoor temperature intelligent control method based on the TD3 algorithm also increases. Although the proposed control method can reduce the operational energy consumption while satisfying the human thermal comfort demand, it still exhibits some limitations: the simulation was conducted under the meteorological conditions of Changsha City, and the feasibility and stability of the proposed method in other regions still need to be further verified. In future work, we need to carry out a long-term assessment of the effectiveness or usefulness of the results of the method in reducing energy consumption and satisfying the thermal comfort of the personnel in terms of novel built-environment optimization strategies in ecologically disturbed areas [38], as well as the field applicability of the method in other different regional conditions, and establish an experimental bench and conduct practical tests. Simultaneously, the occupants' preferences for indoor temperature in the area significantly contribute to directly aligning the indoor thermal environment within the comfort range. Therefore, we can introduce the indoor temperature preference setting into the HVAC control policy, which is able to enhance the occupants' thermal comfort and increase the air-conditioning system energy saving rate. Moreover, in this study, it is by setting a constant number of training times to judge whether the training is completed or not by finally judging the degree of convergence of the model reward curve, and in the subsequent research work, it is necessary to further optimize and adjust the TD3 algorithm to find a kind of training termination condition applicable to a large reward change in order to better obtain the training effect in order to reduce the number of training times. 5 Conclusions This study proposed an indoor temperature intelligent control method based on thermal comfort and energy consumption of air-conditioning, and the TD3 algorithm was employed as an intelligent control algorithm to obtain the optimal setpoint. This setpoint aims to maximize the collective benefits of thermal comfort and the energy saving rate. The air-conditioning indoor temperature intelligent control model based on TD3 algorithm is trained by using the experimental data, and the air-conditioning indoor temperature intelligent control method based on TD3 algorithm is simulated in TRNSYS simulation software to corroborate the efficacy and energy-saving of the method. This study yields the following key conclusions: 1) In applying the TD3 algorithm to multi-objective optimal decision-making problem of indoor temperature setpoint, an air-conditioning indoor temperature intelligent control model based on the TD3 algorithm is proposed. The model contemplates both the human thermal comfort and the energy saving rate, i.e., the model considers the rewards regarding both thermal comfort and the energy saving rate. 2) The method can obtain the optimal indoor temperature setpoint early in the operation of the air-conditioning system. This setpoint maximizes the collective benefits of human thermal comfort and energy saving rate. The method does not need be significantly adjusted many times and improves the stability of the system's control over the indoor thermal environment. 3) Compared to the linear control method based on thermal sensation and the fuzzy control method based on thermal sensation, the method can quickly fulfill the thermal comfort demands in the control initiation stage, while avoiding the impact of continuous changes in the indoor thermal environment on human thermal comfort. 4) The indoor temperature intelligent control method based on TD3 algorithm can save 6.54 % of daily energy consumption on average compared to the linear control method based on thermal sensation; and 3.37 % on average compared to the fuzzy control method based on thermal sensation.

        "dc:description": "The optimization of HVAC system control affects the thermal comfort of building environment and air-conditioning energy consumption. However, most existing studies concentrate on human thermal comfort and neglects to incorporate air-conditioning energy consumption required to establish a controlled indoor thermal environment within the policy, which results in air-conditioning system high energy consumption. This paper suggests an indoor temperature intelligent control method based on thermal comfort and energy consumption of air-conditioning, and the TD3 algorithm is employed as an intelligent control algorithm to obtain the optimal setpoint that maximizes the joint benefit of the occupant\u2019s thermal comfort and the energy saving rate of air-conditioning system. The air-conditioning indoor temperature intelligent control model based on TD3 algorithm is trained by using the experimental data, and the method is simulated in TRNSYS simulation software to corroborate the efficacy and energy saving rate of the method. The results indicate that the indoor temperature intelligent control model based on thermal comfort and energy consumption of air-conditioning has less optimal adjustment of indoor temperature setpoints, which is more stable for the air-conditioning system and can satisfy the thermal comfort demand at the initial control stage to prevent significant fluctuations in human thermal sensation compared to the linear control method based on thermal sensation and the fuzzy control method based on thermal sensation. Besides, the average daily energy consumption can be reduced by 6.54% and 3.37% respectively, when compared to the linear control method based on thermal sensation and the fuzzy control method based on thermal sensation.",
