Nowadays identifying techniques aimed at a rational use of electric power has become even more important than the production of energy itself. This is caused by different factors, as the progressive saturation of the electricity grid, which is increasingly subject to connection requests, mainly due to the development of plants which exploit renewable energy sources. This work suggests a new approach based on the combination of the optimizer and the simulator developed in the MATLAB/Simulink environment, in order to reduce the energy costs in buildings during the summer while taking into consideration the user comfort. The electrical consumption of the entire building is taken into consideration is here examined with the aim of applying an air-conditioning system. The goal is to find, the day before, which is the optimal hourly scheduling of the control variables that must be applied the next day, taking into consideration all external conditions; weather conditions and the hourly energy price. In order to achieve this objective, the control variables, that have been changed, are the room temperature set points and the flow water temperature set point. As required by the UNI EN ISO 7730:2006 standard, comfort measurement is calculated by PPD (Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied) index. Different scenarios are investigated and two optimization algorithms are compared. The results show that there is an average of 10 − 28 % potential cost saving, while maintaining a high level of comfort (PPD ≤ 12). The study is carried out by simulating a real office building in Italy, and the comparisons are shown regarding the actual settings applied to it. Keywords Multi objective optimization Simulation Energy cost 1 Introduction The building sector is the biggest/most important user of energy and CO 2 emitter in the European Union (EU) and is responsible for about 40% of the EU\u2019s total final energy consumption and CO2 emissions. As a consequence, the cornerstone of the European energy policy has an explicit orientation to the conservation and rational use of energy in buildings as the energy performance of building directive (EPBD) 2002/91/EC and its recast (EPBD) 2010/31/EU indicate [19,20]. The EPBD\u2019s main objective is to promote the cost-effective improvement of the overall energy performance of buildings. In Europe, member states have set an energy savings target of 20% by 2020 and 27% by 2030, mainly through energy efficiency measures. A number of methodologies for optimizing real-time performance, automated fault detection and isolation are developed in IEA-Annex 25 [21]. Moreover, amongst worldwide scale organizations, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) and the International Energy Agency (IEA) have complementary provided strategic and operational directions towards the implementation of energy efficiency improvements in buildings [22]. In the scientific literature various studies are presented regarding the optimization methodologies for the energy management of buildings. In accordance with the European Directive on building performance (EPBD) 2010/31 / EU [24], the next target, starting from 2021, will be the diffusion of almost zero energy buildings. The EU Delegated Regulation 244/2012 [25] establishes that an intermediate step towards this final goal is the so-called \u201dcost optimization\u201d where the level of energy efficiency guaranteed is optimal in terms of costs. Finding proper techniques for a rational use of electrical energy has become, nowadays, even more important than the production of energy itself, because the power grid is gradually becoming saturated and affected by many connection requests coming mostly from plants exploiting renewable energies. The present energy consumption which is necessary to the thermal comfort achievement of rooms and clean water represents almost 30% of the national energetic consumption and it is responsible for almost 25% of the national CO2 emission, which is one of the principal cause of greenhouse effect and temperature heating [4]. An involvement of final users is crucial to reach a new equilibrium, in harmony with the environment and respectful of future generation\u2019s rights. According to the latest Italian Energy Strategy Plan, a change in terms of energetic consumption and rational use of energy is necessary and is considered crucial in order to pursue sustainable economic growth. The dominant algorithms for the optimization of building energy design are derivative-free, stochastic heuristic, multi-objective ones, such as genetic algorithms (GAs). This occurs for the following reasons: \u2022 generally, the objective functions are not differentiable because they are black box functions provided, as output by the simulation tools; \u2022 stochastic heuristic algorithms are preferred because they ensure good sub-optimal solutions in reasonable computational times; \u2022 multi-objective algorithms are highly recommended because building energy performance involves different objective functions such as the minimization of energy needs, thermal discomfort, investments, and polluting emissions. In very recent years, several derivative-free, stochastic heuristic, multi-objective approaches for building energy design are proposed, as outlined by comprehensive review studies see [17]. Most of these approaches are based on Pareto optimization, the Pareto front, that is the set of non-dominated solutions, represents the trade-off solutions among contrasting objective functions. 2 Background and objectives of the study There are numerous methods for the energy optimization, the Genetic Algorithms (GA) are the most popular, mainly because they do not usually converge to local minima and allow to explore large domains of solutions with a feasible computational burden while using single or multi-objective approaches (i.e. with two or more contrasting functions be optimized) [23,26,27]. In the case of multi-objective functions, the optimization is implemented through the use of the Pareto front [28]. The selection of the optimal solution on the Pareto front is indicated by balancing the will and needs of the parties concerned, respecting the weights given to the different objective functions. Several scholars have introduced the multi-objective genetic algorithm to identify the optimum pay-off characteristic between the energy cost of a building and the occupant thermal discomfort [18]. In [16], the aim is to optimize the hourly set point temperatures with a day-ahead planning horizon, based on forecasts of weather conditions and occupancy profiles. The outcome is the Pareto front, and thus the set of non-dominated solutions, among which the user can choose according to his comfort needs and economic constraints. The optimization is performed daily by means of a genetic algorithm (GA) and compared to the reference system, the model predictive control(MPC) produces a reduction of the operating cost around 50%, with a thermal discomfort around 21%. In [14], it is presented a dynamic estimates and predictions of zone loads and temperatures, outdoor weather conditions, and Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system models to minimize energy consumption and cost while meeting equipment and thermal comfort constraints. The MPC results show 34% cost savings compared to baseline feedback control during the cooling season and 16% energy use reduction during the heating season. In this study [15], the control of an integrated heating and cooling system for a building complex in Oslo, Norway, is analyzed. The first objective was to reduce the electricity use of the system and the second objective was to reduce the electricity costs of the system. The results showed that the electricity use of the system could be reduced by about 5% and the electricity costs could be reduced by about 5 − 11 % . In [13], it works by coupling EnergyPlus and MATLAB to run a multi-objective genetic algorithm and proposes an approach for multi-criteria decision-making. The achieved cost reduction is included between 6 − 34 % , while the thermal comfort is between 25 − 47 % In this paper authors combine simulation and optimization techniques to solve the problem of energy management in a smart building. They provide the optimization of a scalarized problem that models the energy costs and the service quality perceived by the residents. The scalarization method makes the multi-objective function create a single solution and the weight is determined before the optimization process. The weights are fixed by an analysis that guarantees the good trade off between the energy cost of a building and the occupant thermal discomfort. The level of service is derived by unhappy residents percentage due to thermal discomfort. This percentage is determined by PPD index (Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied) in the current regulation UNI EN ISO 7730:2006 (see [5]). Multi-objective approaches are very suitable for solving this problem, but given the complexity of the problem, it is difficult to formulate pure mathematical models to evaluate performances. Simulation has been more widely used as the tool to evaluate the energy management of buildings under different policies. When the system operates in a stochastic environment and no closed form expression for objective function is available, the problem is further complicated by the need to estimate the objective function. Afterwards, the interaction between simulation and optimization phases provides the objective function value and its minimization. For this kind of problem, traditional optimization methods based on derivatives cannot be applied. Most known approaches are based on some form of random search, or ordinal optimization approach. In addition, also being the simulation computationally expensive, the extensive exploration of the entire solution domain would imply unacceptable calculation time. To avoid these problems, the Surrogate Method is introduced, first for manufacturing problem and then also for transportation problem [2,3,12]. This Method combines the advantages of stochastic approximation type of algorithm with the ability to obtain sensitivity estimates. The gradient information necessary to drive the stochastic approximation part of the surrogate method is simplified considering the estimation of the objective function for a selection set (it will be describe in Section 4.2.2). In this paper two optimization algorithms have been implemented, namely N S G A − I I (non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm version II) and SM (the Surrogate Method). The N S G A − I I is implemented in several simulation tools and it is useful to validate the Surrogate Method as benchmark; the Surrogate Method is more complex and its main characteristic is to avoid local minima. The aim of the paper consists in comparing and analysing the results and the performances of the these procedures: N S G A − I I is a multi-objective genetic algorithm (i.e. Pareto approach) and the SM for the scalarized problem. The paper is organized as follows: Section 3 presents the problem description. In Section 4 the methodology is reported, where an optimization module, described in Section 4.2 cyclically interacts with a simulation module, described in Section 4.1. The optimization module is formed by one of the two heuristic procedures presented in the paper. In Section 5 tests are described and results are reported and analyzed. Section 6 is dedicated to the conclusion and to the description of the future development of the study. 3 Scalarized problem description A common approach to solving a MOP is,first, to convert the MOP into a single-objective optimization problem by combining the multiple objectives through parameters, which is referred to as parametric, or parameter-based, scalarization. The optimization problem is the minimization of the cost while maintaining adequate comfort level inside the building. The problem analyzed is a bi-criteria problem considering the energy cost and the level of persons satisfaction, we tra (1) min ( X h , Y h ) { E _ c o s t _ d y n ( h ) / C + P D D ( h ) / P } where: \u2022 E _ c o s t _ d y n ( h ) is the cost of energy consumed with dynamic price in a specific hour h of the day, \u2022 PPD(h) is the expected percentage of unsatisfied persons in a specific hour h, \u2022 C and P are parameters, that guarantee a good trade-off between the two terms of the objective function. The constraints of the problem are the following: \u2022 X min\u202f≤\u202fXh \u202f≤\u202fXMax \u2022 F min\u202f≤\u202fYh \u202f≤\u202fFMax Where: - Xh is the zone set-point at time h. It is the set point room temperature at time h. - Yh is the flow set-point at time h. It is the set point temperature of water outlet by thermal plant at time h. Fixed by the optimization the values of Xh and Yh , the simulator evaluates the value of the objective function because there is not a closed form of this function. This optimization it is done 24 times, one for each hour of the day. The range considered for Xh and Yh in the simulation phase is the same with which the real modeled building is working today. The aim is to find, the day before, which is the optimal hourly scheduling of the set points that must be applied the next day, taking into consideration all external conditions; weather conditions and the hourly energy price. The optimization module finds the values of Xh and Yh that minimize the objective function hour by hour, considering the system in the conditions obtained at the previous hour ( X h − 1 and Y h − 1 ). When it considers i = 1 , that is the first hour of optimization, the system is assumed at hypothetical initial condition (X 0 and Y 0). Given the best values for Xh and Yh by the optimization module, the simulation module calculates the objective function value, the cost of energy consumed with dynamic price and the level of unsatisfied persons, hour for hour in a day. The analysis of the objective function is carried out while changing one decision variable at a time (temperature set-point and flow set-point), setting it progressively to each single value assumable, respecting the constraints of the problem and define the baseline to calculate the efficiency of optimization systems. An example of the shape related to one component of the temperature set point vector variation and one component of the flow set point variation is depicted. To visualize the characteristics of the solution space it is not necessary to plot the average system time for all possible combinations of temperature/flow. To show the characteristics of the solution space, the flow and the temperature are kept constants, except for one component at time for each decision vector (X or Y). The behaviour of the objective function is reported in Fig. 1 and 2 , varying Xh and Yh respectively. In particular in Fig. 1 the trend of the objective function is reported when the temperature for the first hour is set be equal to 21 ( X 1 = 21 ∘ ) and the flow varies between its range, instead in Fig. 2 the trend of the objective function is reported when the flow for the first hour is set be equal to 10 ( Y 1 = 10 ) and the temperature varies between its range. The trend is similar for the other hours of the day. The trend of the objective function both compared to Xh and Yh has several local minima, this highlights the complexity of the problem and the difficulty to find global optimum. Each simulation is about a single day in which it is possible to set the different set-points from hour to hour. This made the system dynamic and efficient in the vision of a hypothetical functioning in reality. 4 The proposed methodology In this section the simulation and optimization modules are described. In Fig. 3 the interaction between the two modules is depicted. The input to the system are the building layout and external parameters. The simulation module calculates the objective function value and optimization module optimizes the zone and the flow set-point. The two modules cyclically interact till a stop criterion is verified. The output of the system consists of the optimal value of the objective function, the cost of energy consumed and the measure of the level of satisfaction associated to the best solution for each hour of the day. 4.1 Simulation module Simulink is the software chosen to model the building and all its thermal and electrical components (heating system, fan coil power supply network, lighting network). Simulink is a software dedicated to modeling, simulation, and analysis of dynamic systems, which is closely integrated with MATLAB. On the other hand, HAMBASE (Heat, Air and Moisture model for building and system evaluation)[8,9] which is a software to do a simulation model for the heat and vapour flows in the building. The HAMBASE software helped to simulate the behavior of the building, and to do this it uses the model of the internal temperature, relative humidity of the internal air, and energy consumption required for the heating and cooling of a multi-zone building. The purpose of the software developed is to allow to simulate energy saving strategies and control logic, having as output of the simulation itself two main parameters such as: - Internal environmental parameters, such as internal temperature and relative humidity that identify the environmental comfort; - Aggregate parameters such as electricity and methane consumption that identify the energy expenditure, calculated in terms of euro spent. The parameters received as input from the simulator are different, the most significant for the purposes of calculating the two functions PPD (Predicted Percent Dissatisfied) and cost of given the flow set point and zone temperature set point. These two decision-making variables certainly can determine the value of the total objective function, however, they are not the only ones that have a direct influence on the value of the objective function. Indeed, there are other parameters that affect the function, but they are not set dynamically. These parameters are mainly six: the national unit price curve (PUN) that determines the dynamism of the energy price; the external climatic conditions that affect the trend of consumption and the climatic conditions inside the building; the external and internal humidity; energy parameters to best simulate the energy absorption of the building; the activities and occupation of the different areas and rooms of the building; and other parameters. In output, a multiplicity of values regarding the thermal conditions and consumption of the building is obtained, but for what concerns the use of the simulator in this case, it will stop to specify only the output values of the PPD and the cost (\u20ac), calculated respectively by the two subsystems of the simulator Subsystem Comfort Meter and Subsystem Dynamic Pricing highlighted in Fig. 4 . In fact in the following figure we can see an idea of the general scheme of the simulator and in particular a zoom on the two subsystem that will be described in detail in the next sections. For more details regarding the different specifications of the simulator, the reader can refer to other more detailed articles [7,10,11]. 4.1.1 Subsystem comfort meter The thermo-hygrometric comfort indices provided by the simulator are in line with the UNI EN ISO 7730:2006 standard, which specifies the methods for predicting the overall thermal sensation and the degree of discomfort (thermal dissatisfaction) of people. The Danish scholar Fanger established two equations described in detail in UNI EN ISO 7730:2006 for the evaluation of thermo-hygrometric well-being. PMV expresses the level of satisfaction of a large sample of people working in the same building and expressing their thermal sensation through a psychophysical scale. In Table 1 it is possible to see the ranges of possible values that the PMV index can accept, if the thermal environment is neutral the values will be 0, but if the people are warm or cold the value will be respectively positive or negative. The PPD can be computed using PMV model, in fact they are experimentally related through the following formula: (2) P P D = 100 − 95 * e − ( 0 , 03353 * P V M 4 + 0 , 2179 * P V M 2 ) It should be noted that it is not possible to use PMV and PPD evaluation indices in all working conditions but only when certain parameters are included in fixed ranges. The ranges through which it is possible to apply the PMV and PPD indices, in terms of energy metabolism, thermal insulation of clothing present and the air temperature and velocity are reported in Table 2 . These four variables are set to their typical values: metabolism (70 [W/m2]), external work (0 [W/m2]), air velocity (0.1 [m/s]) and clothing (0.18 o m2 ∘C/W). The convergence of four input channels is performed during the modelling of this subsystem (Fig. 4). These channels are: - Ta = air temperature [∘C], it is the temperature perceived inside the room; - Ts = radiant temperature [∘C], it is the temperature of the walls inside the room, including the ceiling and floor; - Rh = it is the relative humidity inside; - c_pmv = it is the comfort meter. When appropriately processed with a function that takes into account both the inputs and the limits of applicability of the criterion, these channels produce three different output channels in output, which, however, can only be traced back to the PPD: - PMV = expected average score (for each zone); - PMV_mean = average expected average score (average of values for each zone); - PPD = expected percentage of dissatisfaction [%]. 4.1.2 Subsystem dynamic pricing The Subsystem relative to the simulation of the cost of the consumed energy is modelled as in Fig. 4 where two inputs can be examined: - Q_e_tot= total electric power consumed[W], which is calculated as the sum of fan-coil ventilation consumption, lighting consumption and heat pump consumption (electric power supplied) (3) Q _ e _ t o t = Q _ e _ f a n + Q _ e _ l i g h t + Q _ e - PUN = single national electricity price [\u20ac /MWh], i.e. the reference price of electricity on the Italian electricity exchange (IPEX, Italian Power Exchange); and 4 outputs properly calculated as: - E_cost_flat = cost of energy consumed with static price [\u20ac ]; - E_cost_flat_h = cost of energy consumed with static price sampled hour by hour [\u20ac /h]; - E_cost_dyn = cost of energy consumed with dynamic price [\u20ac ]; - E_cost_dyn_h = cost of energy consumed with dynamic price sampled from hour to hour [\u20ac /h]. By looking at the inputs and outputs of this subsystem, it is possible to identify the consequences, since the multiplications between the amount of energy consumed[W] and its cost [\u20ac ] ordered the variables in terms of magnitude and measure. The attention is drawn by the values of dynamic cost, in particular those sampled from hour to hour. 4.2 Optimization module The optimization module embeds an optimization algorithm. Two different algorithms are testes by considering the same input data sets. The procedures are: a Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II), a Surrogate Method. The first one represents a reference case, since the Genetic Algorithms are adopted by several simulators; In the following the two procedures are described and the related pseudo-code is reported. 4.2.1 The genetic algorithm for smart building The NSGA-II is a genetic algorithm proposed by Kalyanmoy Deb in 2000 and represents an advanced revision of the NSGA, Deb himself, dating from 1994. This algorithm is part of the family of elite evolutionary algorithms, which is distinguishes from non-elitarians by passing from one generation to the next without lost good solutions. The abbreviation NSGA (Non dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm) emphasizes how solutions for the optimization problem are ordered in accordance with the concept of non-dominance. NSGA-II provides that all solutions of a population are classified according to a dominance order. Non-dominated population solutions will have rank 1. Solutions that are not dominated by the entire population, except for those with rank 1, will have rank 2 and so on. The computational complexity of this procedure is the sum of the complexities required to identify each non-dominated set. It is important to notice that once the first non-dominated set is identified, the number of remaining solutions will be smaller than the original number of individuals in the population, hence the classifications after the first one will require less computational complexity. The entire classification process has O(MN2) complexity, with M number of targets and N size of population. Fig. 5 shows an example of ordering by levels, of a population of 10 individuals, in a problem of minimization of two target functions. Assigning a rank to all solutions means the crowded distance is assigned, which is a value that indicates how much a solution is isolated. The aim is to preserve the diversity of solutions on the same non-dominated front, thus maintaining a good distribution. They are ordered iteratively in a worsening order with respect to each target function. Extreme results with the best and worst fitness are assigned at an infinite crowding distance. The others are assigned with a value proportional to the distance between the i-solution and the previous and subsequent solutions. When comparing two solutions the rank is compared first, if they have the same rank the crowding distance is compared. It is possible to notice how the steps that the NSGA-II performs are the same as those of any genetic algorithm: Steps of (NSGA-II) GM 1. Population initialization; 2. Rank assignment and crowding distance; 3. Application genetic operators 4. A union of father and daughter generation; 5. Rank assignment and crowding distance; 6. Selection of the best; 7. Return to step 3 until the stop condition is met. 4.2.2 The surrogate method for smart building The Surrogate Method solves the optimization problem by using the gradient method. This procedure presents an iterative structure that, in each cycle, transforms the original problem with discrete decision variables, into an optimization problem with continuous decision variables. The last problem is known as Surrogate. Subsequently, the gradient estimate, which allows to update the solution, is performed in the discrete field. The transition from the discrete problem to the continuous problem occurs at each cycle of the algorithm and the update of the surrogate solution is obtained through the variation of the objective function computed in the discrete state. The Surrogate Method gives good results in various application areas, such as the lot sizing problems or the urban traffic, failing to find the solution good/sub-optimal original discrete problem and reaching the very fast convergence [1\u20133]. The steps sequence of the algorithm is reported in Algorithm 1 . Vector Z = ( X , Y ) is an 2N-dimensional decision vector (N is equal to 24 where each component denotes the degree for zone flow set-point for each hour of the day, subject to the capacity constraints Ad and Jd (Z) is the cost incurred when the state is Z. The integer capacity constraint is relaxed and a resulting surrogate problem is obtained. The basic idea of this method is to solve a continuous optimization problem by stochastic approximation methods and establish the fact that when (and if) a solution of the relaxed problem ρ* is obtained it can be mapped into a discrete point z = f ( ρ * ) ∈ A d which is in fact the solution of our problem. The Transformation function f is defined in step 4. Note however, that the sequence {ρk }, k = 1 , 2 , \u2026 , generated by an iterative scheme for solving the relaxed problem consists of real-valued solutions which are unfeasible, since the actual system involves only discrete resources. Thus, a key feature of the Surrogate algorithm is that at every step k of the iteration scheme, the discrete state is updated through z k = f ( ρ k ) as ρk is updated. This has two advantages: - the cost of the original system is continuously adjusted (in contrast to an adjustment that would only be possible at the end of the Surrogate optimization process); - it gives the possibility to make use of information typically employed to obtain cost sensitivities from the actual operating system at every step of the process. Note that there is an additional operation: the {zk } corresponds to feasible states based on which one can evaluate estimates ∇Lc (ρk ), calculated on actual system zk (not the surrogate state ρk , see step 3 of Fig. 1). We can therefore see that this scheme is intended to combine the advantages of stochastic approximation type of algorithm with the ability to obtain sensitivity estimates with respect to discrete decision variables. In Fig. 6 the integration of the simulation module into the Surrogate Method is represented. The Surrogate Method starts from a random feasible solution and determines the selection set S(ρk ) described in Steps 5\u201313 of Algorithm 1. Note that, for each updating step of the surrogate state (step 16 of Algorithm 1) the objective function value is computed 2 N + 1 times by the simulation module. Hence, it becomes crucial to develop an efficient simulation module which performs an acceptable computation time. 5 Results analysis Each simulation is about a single day in which it is possible to set the different set-points every hour. This made the system dynamic and efficient in the vision of a hypothetical functioning in reality. The simulator takes in input both the values of the decision variables that are set up and the final states of the simulator returned by the optimization system. The goal of the problem is to minimize a multi objective function with cost and comfort (energy cost [\u20ac ] and PPD [%]). 5.1 A case study A real office building located at ENEA (Casaccia Research Centre, Rome, Italy) is examined as a case study (Fig. 7 ). The building has an L-shaped structure, it is oriented 15∘ north-east and it is built between 1970 and 1972 and it is formed by three floors and a heating plant in the basement. There are 41 offices of different size with a floor area ranging from 14 to 36 m2, 2 EDP rooms of about 20 m2 each, 4 Laboratories, 1 Control Room and 2 Meeting Rooms, for a total of 1277,3 m2. Each office room has from one up to two occupants. Each room and laboratory is equipped with fan-coils with on-off fan speed which is controlled by a room thermostat with hysteresis. The heating plant is a traditional natural gas boiler [10,11]. The building is equipped with an advanced monitoring system aimed at collecting data revealing both external and internal conditions, electrical and thermal energy consumption. In order to simulate the control variables of interest, a MATLAB Simulink simulator based on HAMBASE [5,6] model is developed. The control variables are: - Zone set point temperature which can be set using thermostats in each room [∘C]; - Flow set point (set point temperature of water outlet by thermal plant) which can be set by means of special instrumentation in the building\u2019s thermal power plant [∘C]. These control variables are setting also in the real building, in fact it is an intelligent and connected bulding, equipped with IoT devices. Simulink is used to both model the described building, together with all its thermal and electrical components and simulate the behavior of the F40 building is used the HAMBASE software, which exploited the internal temperature model, the relative humidity of the indoor air and the energy consumption required for the heating and cooling of a multi-zone building. The purpose of the software developed is to simulate the energy saving strategies and control logic in order to maximize energy savings, and therefore to minimize the cost. The outputs are: - environmental comfort; - cost of consumed energy. To evaluate the efficiency of the algorithm, the combination of set-points with which the F40 building is currently air-conditioned during the summer season is taken into consideration: \u2022 Zone s e t _ p o i n t = 22 ∘ C; \u2022 Flow s e t _ p o i n t = 10 ∘ C; which are kept constant throughout the simulation period. The simulations are performed by taking three different initial zone set point and one flow set point: X 0 = 21 ; 23 ; 25 [ ∘ C] and Y 0 = 10 [ ∘ C]. The constrains of the problem are fixed as \u2022 22 ≤ Xh ≤ 25 \u2022 10 ≤ Yh ≤ 12 The weights of the scalarization C and P have been set by analysing the values of the objective function in order to guarantee the requirements of UNI EN ISO 7730:2006 (see [5]) for PPD: C = 1 and P = 12 . It is possible to observe the results obtained by simulating the real functioning of the building, without any kind of optimization (RC Real Case, with static set-point), in comparison with the optimized one, in which each simulation involved changing the flow set-point and the zone set-point in specific ranges. In Tables 3 and 4 a comparison between Real Case (RC), Surrogate Method (SM) and Genetic Algorithm ( N S G A − 2 ) is reported, considering the average trend in a day. In particular in Table 3 the values of the average cost for a day are reported, for the three different initials temperatures, which affect the total cost of cooling and the percentage of dissatisfied. In fact, with a higher initial temperature more people are dissatisfied because it is warmer, and the cost of cooling the building is higher. On the other hand, in Table 4 reports the average improvement given by the optimization methods. The average improvement is calculated by: \u2022 E c o s t ( R C ) − E c o s t ( S M ) E c o s t ( R C ) * 100 \u2022 E c o s t ( R C ) − E c o s t ( N S G A − 2 ) E c o s t ( R C ) * 100 The best performances are given by the Surrogate Method when the initial temperature is equal to 23∘ given an improvement of 28.3%. In particular, the mean value of the cost of energy consumed with dynamic price passes from an average of 29.8 \u20ac/day to 23.92 \u20ac/day, which means a decremented of around 20%, while the average PPD for the same period still remains equals to around 9%. Therefore, the proposed methodology allows to save around 6 \u20ac/day, it passes from around 2,980 \u20ac to around 2,329 \u20ac for the whole building, obtaining a saving of 588 \u20ac during the cooling season. In Figs. 8\u201310 the trend of the objective function for the two optimization methods is shown during the 24-hours. The biggest gap occurs in the early hours of the afternoon when the Surrogate Method provides better performances. When the initial temperature is equal to 25∘ the trend of the optimization methods is different because it is more difficult to satisfy users when the initial temperature is higher. 6 Conclusion Through this study it is possible to identify and understand two different optimization strategies applied smart buildings, which aim to reduce energy consumption and, at the same time, minimize the percentage of unsatisfied occupants caused by thermal discomfort. Furthermore, this combination of simulator and optimizer will be used for experiments in the field of local energy communities, which is one of the last topics of the system research of the ENEA Research Center, whose goal is to achieve autonomy, sustainability and efficiency with respect to today\u2019s energy needs. On average, a theoretical saving of 16.5% is found compared to the reference case, in particular the two algorithms, NSGA-II and Surrogate Method, brought respectively an average theoretical saving of 13.9% and 19.1%, even though it would be more correct and consistent to consider and analyze the three cases separately. As a matter of fact, for the first two cases it is examined the Surrogate Method is more efficient, obtaining much better results, while in the last case ( X 0 = 25 ∘ C) the NSGA-II algorithm is competitive in finding an excellent solution during the first hours of the simulation, even though Surrogate Method is once again the most efficient throughout the day. It is here used the term theoretical savings because the strategy is not applied to the actual building. In this regard, it is appropriate to make some considerations to have a better understanding of the differences that may arise in dealing with a problem of this type compared to the case simulated: - The results obtained are the result of simulations which, although accurate, do not reproduce the exact behaviour of the F40 building; - The external climatic conditions, taken as input from the simulator, are not the result of a forecast but are a record of the conditions revealed in 2013 season. This implies the need of extremely accurate weather forecasts; - The trend of the PUN, taken as an input from the simulator, represents energy prices dating back to 2013 in the same period of the simulation; - The PPD index used to evaluate the percentage of dissatisfied personnel, although imposed by the regulations, is a subjective index and difficult to calculate in reality since it depends on parameters such as metabolism and clothing, specific to each individual; In conclusion it can be stated that the two algorithms have both led to economic savings without losing sight of PPD and that however a different and innovative approach as that of the Surrogate Method gives the possibility to obtain better results than a classic approach such as that with NSGA-II. Right this way, we are already working to perform the integration with the optimizer will be upgraded so that the different values of the zone set-points of the 15 different climate zones of the building can be managed individually. In addition, we are working on a new version of the simulator that integrates the PV (PhotoVoltaic) and a storage for an even more effective management of energy consumption. Finally, to validate the solutions proposed in a real case, this strategy will be applied to the F40 smart building and for a real implementation would require the real time information of the energy price on the market, which we could assume to have from the MSD (Dispatching Services Market), [29].

        "dc:description": "Nowadays identifying techniques aimed at a rational use of electric power has become even more important than the production of energy itself. This is caused by different factors, as the progressive saturation of the electricity grid, which is increasingly subject to connection requests, mainly due to the development of plants which exploit renewable energy sources. This work suggests a new approach based on the combination of the optimizer and the simulator developed in the MATLAB/Simulink environment, in order to reduce the energy costs in buildings during the summer while taking into consideration the user comfort. The electrical consumption of the entire building is taken into consideration is here examined with the aim of applying an air-conditioning system. The goal is to find, the day before, which is the optimal hourly scheduling of the control variables that must be applied the next day, taking into consideration all external conditions; weather conditions and the hourly energy price. In order to achieve this objective, the control variables, that have been changed, are the room temperature set points and the flow water temperature set point. As required by the UNI EN ISO 7730:2006 standard, comfort measurement is calculated by PPD (Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied) index. Different scenarios are investigated and two optimization algorithms are compared. The results show that there is an average of 10 − 28 % potential cost saving, while maintaining a high level of comfort (PPD ≤ 12). The study is carried out by simulating a real office building in Italy, and the comparisons are shown regarding the actual settings applied to it.",
