Department of Electrical Engineering Amirkabir University of Technology 424 Hafez ave. Tehran 15916-34311 Iran The optimal performance of the smart home energy management system (SHEMS) in coordinating and integrating the equipment in the house plays a significant role in increasing the efficiency and economic benefits of the smart home. This paper proposes a two-level optimization algorithm for the energy management of residential appliances within a smart home, including interruptible, uninterruptible, thermostatically controlled, and non-schedulable loads, as well as the charging/discharging strategies of electric vehicles (EVs) and energy storage systems (ESSs) in the presence of distributed energy resources (DERs). In the first level of optimization, to minimize the cost of electricity, the operating time of smart home components is determined by SHEMS, and active power is exchanged between equipment. At this level, the impact of demand response (DR) constraints on the cost and load factor (LF) of the smart home have also been investigated. In the second level, considering the optimal cost obtained in the first level, in addition to the active power, the reactive power required by loads is also provided by using the additional capacity of EV and ESS inverters and improves the power factor (PF) of the house at the connection point to the grid. Day-ahead electricity costs are calculated depending on different pricing signals (TOU, RTP) with the power exchange capacity (buying/ selling) with the grid. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is examined on a typical smart home over a 24-h. By reviewing the numerical results obtained for the cost and the LF in different scenarios, and observing the increase of the PF of home from 0.65 to 0.94 and also examining the performance of the equipment during the planning time, the efficiency of the model is proved.

Consequently, residential energy-saving and efficiency improvement are necessary, especially in the circumstance of energy crisis and environmental pollution (Wang et al., 2017). These critical issues have made researchers think about the smart grid as an overall and better solution. Demand-side management (DSM) strategies are one of the smart grid approaches to solve the mentioned problems that are designed to encourage consumers to modify their consumption patterns. DSM strategies, including strategic load growth, load shifting, peak clipping, flexible load shape, valley filling, and strategic conservation, reduce the gap between supply and demand (Babaei et al., 2020; Chamandoust, Derakhshan, Hakimi et al., 2020). To decrease electricity costs, homeowners can use renewable energy resources (RERs) like wind and solar generation. Since the amount of energy produced by RERs depends on climatic conditions, using ESSs to solve the uncertainty problem of these sources is a good solution because they can actively participate in tackling the fluctuations associated with these uncertainties (Aznavi, Fajri, Sabzehgar, & Asrari, 2020). However, to manage the generated and stored power and the power consumed by electric home appliances, some infrastructures, and smart appliances are needed, the most important of which is the home energy management system (HEMS). The HEMS is an essential system in smart homes for successful demand response (DR) and DSM programs. The HEMS can obtain all the information required by establishing two-way communication with utility as well as contact with house equipment and design the best possible schedule to control smart home appliances according to obtained information by considering the user\u2019s preferences to reduce the energy cost payments along with improving consumers' comfort level, data security and reliability in addition to power quality, and being capable of more flexible operation, etc. Recent advancements in information and communications technology, such as advanced measurement infrastructure (AMI), intelligent sensor technologies, two-way communication, smart home appliances, and home area network (HAN), help the HEMS with smart home management and control (Zhou et al., 2016). As part of DSM programs, DR is defined as any change in consumers' usual electricity consumption pattern, determined by the utility in response to changes in electricity prices during one day (Zhou et al., 2016). Loads in smart homes are divided into two general categories of schedulable and non-schedulable loads based on their ability to participate in DR programs. The HEMS plans a smart home in such a way that the operation of schedulable loads is transferred from peak to off-peak hours or that the power required during peak hours is supplied by DERs or the ESS as much as possible, thus reducing the power drawn from the grid and electricity costs of the smart home. Different time-varying pricing methods like time-of-use (TOU) pricing, real-time pricing (RTP), and critical peak pricing (CPP) are used to determine the price of electricity in DR programs (Zhou et al., 2016). Electric vehicles (EVs) have attracted the attention of smart homeowners due to their environmental and economic advantages for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and fossil fuel dependence. EVs, like ESSs, can charge power (G2V) as well as discharge it for home (V2H) and grid (V2G) use, but adding it to smart homes is a significant challenge for the HEMS (Khemakhem, Rekik, & Krichen, 2020). Many studies have been performed on the HEMS to optimally schedule different residential loads. Reference (Gil et al., 2020) aims at surveying the recent literature on the HEMS in the context of residential buildings, managed household appliances, and scheduling objectives, as well as discussing physical and operational constraints in addition to the HEMS solutions for them. In (Zhou et al., 2016), a comprehensive review of the smart HEMS architecture with advanced infrastructures, home appliances, and various buildings using RESs like solar, wind, biomass, and geothermal energy is presented. At last, different scheduling strategies to reduce electricity costs are investigated. A review of different management strategies for non-residential and residential buildings energy management systems (BEMS) to improve energy efficiency and discuss future challenges to increasing energy efficiency in BEMS is presented in (Hern et al., 2020). The authors (Kong, Sun, Kong, & Li, 2020) have established a HEMS with distributed power generation and an EV describing a multi-objective optimization model with risk cost and risk index constraints to reduce electricity costs while maintaining a degree of comfort. Reference (Wang, Mao, & Khodaei, 2021) presents a multi-objective optimization method for the HEMS based on the internet of things (IoT) to improve energy costs and user satisfaction. To increase the speed of convergence, a new, improved version of the butterfly algorithm has been used to solve the problem. A day-ahead multi-objective optimization model for BEMS is presented in (F. Wang et al., 2017) to increase economic benefits and improve the occupants' comfort, including the visual comfort, thermal comfort, and indoor air quality by the synergetic dispatch of source-load-storage. The authors (Liu, Xiao, Yao, & Bu, 2019) have presented a pricing-based DR for smart homes with different appliances by considering various occupants\u2019 satisfaction levels. Demand-limit-based DR and injection-limit-based DR can be easily adapted to this scheduling scheme. In (Ma, Hu, Yang, Xu, & Guan, 2018), a model for appliance-scheduling for the HEMS based on day-ahead prices is proposed to minimize electricity bills, carbon dioxide emissions, and users' dissatisfaction. The optimization problem is solved by particle swarm optimization (PSO). (Wu, Hu, Moura, Yin, & Pickert, 2016) presents a stochastic optimal control problem to manage the power flow among the sources in smart homes by developing random-variable models like the Markov Chain model of plug-in EV (PEV) mobility and predictive models of demand and photovoltaic (PV) generation. In (Lokeshgupta & Sivasubramani, 2019), an intelligent multi-objective DSM with the ESS is proposed and modeled by MILP to minimize electricity bills and the peak load demand. An economic analysis of ESS with demand uncertainty modeling is also presented in this paper. A novel approach to optimize the appliance operation towards retail electricity prices is presented in (Golmohamadi, Keypour, Bak-Jensen, & Pillai, 2019). On the demand side, the HEMS schedules various appliances like thermal and electrical storage capacity and uses a heuristic forward-backward algorithm (F-BA) and a peak flattening scheme (PFS) to minimize the electricity cost and keep the peak demand from occurring, respectively. In (Hu, Xiao, Cui, & Wang, 2018), is focused on real-time two-way communication between the utility and users so that each user is equipped with a HEMS to determine the optimal energy management and scheduling by proposing a distributed real-time algorithm. Reference (Yahia & Pradhan, 2018) presents residential appliance scheduling by developing and solving a binary integer linear programming optimization problem and examining influential factors on the obtained schedule of loads. Also, it proposes a conceptual definition of a new parameter in the problem, which is the so-called \u201cflexibility ratio\u201d. In (Essiet, Sun, & Wang, 2019), an improved and enhanced differential evolution algorithm is developed, which can optimize a multi-objective optimization problem for smart homes by considering shiftable and non-shiftable loads that model energy usage profile for an ordinary household. In (Chamandoust, Derakhshan, & Bahramara, 2020; Chamandoust, Derakhshan, Hakimi et al., 2020), for reshaping the demand profile and optimal planning of electrical and thermal energy consumption, with the objectives of reducing cost, reducing pollution emission, and also increasing the level of customer satisfaction, methods such as demand curtailment, demand shifting, and onsite generation program have been used. The uncertainties of energy and reserve prices are modeled using the lognormal distribution function and the shuffled frog-leaping algorithm (SFLA), fuzzy method, and the weight sum is used to solve the problem. All the mentioned studies have examined the HEMS from different perspectives. However, the common point among them is the HEMS's ability to manage active power and its distribution among the existing components in smart homes, whose primary objective is the reduction of electricity cost payments. The ability to determine reactive power consumption by smart meters will soon be provided in all residential homes, allowing the utility to impose penalties on people with a high consumption's level, whose power factor (PF) is lower than a specified limit. The reduction in PF is much more sensible in households with DERs. In traditional power systems, the utility provides both active and reactive power. Still, in the smart grids that house equipped with DERs, ESSs, and EVs, the required active power is supplied by these local sources in some intervals. The active input power from the grid is a small amount or equal to zero while the utility still provides the required reactive power; the PF is much less than one and may even reach zero (Golshannavaz, 2018). Therefore, the need for reactive energy management to increase the PF and prevent additional costs in residential homes, especially smart homes, is fully felt. Up to now, little research has been carried out on reactive energy management in smart home environments, in the presence of different types of home appliances, and without entering voltage and current in the calculations. In Reference (Golshannavaz, 2018), reactive power compensation is performed by ESS and EV inverters using a two-stage optimization program in addition to reducing the costs associated with active power. In the proposed paper, a two-level optimization method has been used. First, all the appliances in the smart home, including DERs and loads, are modeled. In the first level of optimization, the SHEMS deals only with active power management and does not refer to reactive power. Therefore, the time of using each household load, the time of charging and discharging the ESS and EV, and the time of buying and selling power from/to the grid are planned by the SHEMS in such a way as to minimize the cost of daily electricity consumption. The values set by the occupants of the smart home at the desired indoor temperature and water consumption are taken into account in the modeling of thermostatically controlled loads. The cost is calculated using the pricing signal set by the grid. TOU and RTP pricing schemes are part of the DR programs. In these schemes, the grid tries to change the consumption pattern of consumers by changing the price of electricity during the day. Limiting the amount of power purchased and sold from/to the grid is another DR strategy to change the consumption pattern. In the second level of optimization, in addition to managing active power with the lowest payment cost, reactive power management is also done to increase the PF of the smart home. To meet both objectives simultaneously, the optimal cost obtained in the first level is defined as the constraint in the second level. The maximum PF (minimum reactive power drawn from the grid) is defined as the objective function in the second level. Thus, the capacity of the two-way inverters of the ESS and EV are first used to supply the active power, and then their remaining capacity to provide the required reactive power is often used. The most important reason for presenting a two-level optimization algorithm is to prioritize the economic interests of the household over increasing the PF. Because reactive power management influences active power planning, it is complicated to achieve these two goals by prioritizing cost, at one level. While using two-level optimization achieves the desired goals without any problems. In general, the main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows: \u2022 Integration and coordination of some equipment including interruptible, uninterruptible, thermostatically controlled loads and DERs including PV and WT by SHEMS. \u2022 Establishing an Optimal schedule by the HEMS for a smart home with various types of residential appliances and determining whether loads are switched off or on together with the charge/discharge time of the EV and ESS. \u2022 Considering the convenience of smart home residents in providing the desired temperature of the home environment and water consumption by modeling thermal loads. \u2022 Utilizing the EV and ESS charging and discharging capability to supply the active and reactive power required in homes at some time intervals. \u2022 Ability to buy or sell active power from/to the utility by considering TOU and RTP pricing schemes. \u2022 Achieving the optimal amount of cost and PF of smart home by prioritizing the cost by the two-level optimization method provided. \u2022 Apply DR constraints on the amount of power purchased from the grid and examine its effects on cost and load factor (LF) The remainder of this study is organized as follows. In section 2, the structure of the smart home, modeling, and problem formulation for all residential appliances as MILP is proposed. The Discussions and simulation results are illustrated in section 3. Finally, the conclusion of the proposed paper is presented in section 4. 2 Proposed system architecture and modeling The structure and components of the smart home are shown in Fig. 1 . The SHEMS, smart meter, PV, WT, DC/AC inverter, EV, ESS, and different residential loads are the main components of the smart home. The HEMS can schedule the operating time of residential appliances, charging and discharging time for the EV and ESS, and the absorption or injection time of reactive power by a bidirectional inverter and by receiving the essential information and establishing bidirectional communication with the utility. The smart home can buy or sell active power and can only purchase reactive power from the utility. The assumptions made in modeling smart home equipment are as follows: \u2022 The effect of battery aging and its costs is ignored. \u2022 SHEMS receives all the necessary information, including weather forecast, from the data center. \u2022 All equipment is connected to the SHEMS via a communication signal such as ZigBee. In this section, first, modeling of DERs and types of loads in the smart home will be presented. Then, by examining the equations in the first and second levels, the objective functions of each level are defined. 2.1 DERs DERs refer to the small power resources located close to energy consumers like smart homes and buildings. Installing and applying renewable energy resources have many economic benefits for the residents of smart homes; instead of buying expensive energy from the utility, they use the electricity produced by renewable resources and even can sell this power to the utility. PVs and WTs are presented as two power generations here. Solar energy is converted into electrical energy through a photovoltaic (PV) system. Due to its easy installation and low cost, solar PV is widely used in smart homes. Wind turbine (WT) is another DER in homes whose output power depends on wind speed. For modeling PV and WT, the relations expressed in (Shirazi, Zakariazadeh, & Jadid, 2015) and (Wang, Palazoglu, & El-Farra, 2014), respectively, have been used. 2.2 Residential loads In this analysis, home appliances are divided into two main groups based on their inherent characteristics: schedulable and non-schedulable. Non-schedulable appliances such as refrigerators and lighting equipment have an unchanging operating time; therefore, they cannot be scheduled or optimized (Melhem, Grunder, Hammoudan, & Moubayed, 2017). These loads cannot be interrupted, curtailed, and/or moved to another time and have to be satisfied by the HEMS whenever the consumer needs to do so. For this reason, this type of load doesn't contribute to energy management. In contrast, there are schedulable household appliances that are classified into three categories: interrupted, uninterrupted, and thermostatically-controlled. These appliances can participate in energy management programs and be scheduled by the HEMS, taking into account user preferences so that the smart home can achieve its desired goals. 2.2.1 Interruptible loads (IL) Interruptible loads can be interrupted in the middle of their operation and restarted at another time without sacrificing the user's comfort. In other words, due to the price of electricity and other restrictions, HEMS can change the operating time of these loads and postpone it to another time. In other words, due to the price of electricity and other constraints, HEMS can change the operating time of these loads and postpone it to another time (Solat, Hossein, Hosseinian, Gharehpetian, & Hosseini, 2018). EVs and ESSs equipped with a bidirectional inverter also can absorb and inject reactive power. 2.2.1.1 ESS modeling In a smart home, the ESS can act both as a power source and an energy consumer, depending on its operating mode (charging or discharging). When the ESS is being charged as a load, the HEMS can stop charging as scheduled and postpone it to another time. For this reason, the ESS is a type of interruptible load. The constraints of the ESS are mathematically shown as follows: (1) − P t E S S , d c h . η E S S = P t E S S , u s e d + P t E S S , s o l d , ∀ t (2) 0 ≤ P t E S S , c h ≤ R E S S , c h . a t E S S , ∀ t (3) − R E S S , d c h . 1 − a t E S S ≤ P t E S S , d c h ≤ 0 , ∀ t (4) P t E S S = P t E S S , c h − P t E S S , d c h , ∀ t (5) C t E S S = C E S S , i n i t , i f t = 1 (6) C t E S S = C t − 1 E S S + P t E S S , c h . η E S S + P t E S S , d c h / η E S S . Δ t , ∀ t > 1 (7) C E S S , min ≤ C t E S S ≤ C E S S , max , ∀ t (8) C t E S S = C E S S , i n i t , i f t = T Eqs. (1)\u2013(8) are related to the first level, while active energy management. Eq. (1) represents a part of the discharging power of the ESS used at home and another part sold to the main grid. According to (2) and (3), the amount of charge and discharge cannot be more than the rated charging and discharging power of the ESS. They also state that charging and discharging cannot take place at the same time. The net active power of the ESS is calculated by (4). Eq. (5) denotes the initial capacity of the ESS. The ESS capacity is calculated by (6), and this amount is bounded in a suitable range by (7). The final capacity of the ESS should be equal to the initial value based on (8). 2.2.1.2 EV modeling EVs and ESSs have the same function, except that the EV is not available in smart homes at the part of the scheduling horizon and is outside the home using the energy stored in its battery. The EV is parked and charged in the smart home parking lot as soon as it enters the house. Of course, like the ESS, it can act as a power supply at some intervals and give some of its charged power to the smart home (V2H) or even sell it to the upstream grid (V2G). The equations of the EV are shown in (9)\u2013(16). (9) − P t E V , d c h . η E V = P t E V , u s e d + P t E V , s o l d , ∀ t ∈ [ T a , T d ] (10) 0 ≤ P t E V , c h ≤ R E V , c h . a t E V , ∀ t ∈ [ T a , T d ] (11) − R E V , d c h . 1 − a t E V ≤ P t E V , d c h ≤ 0 , ∀ t ∈ [ T a , T d ] (12) P t E V = P t E V , c h − P t E V , d c h , ∀ t (13) C t E V = C E V , i n i t , i f t = T (14) C t E V = C t − 1 E V + P t E V , c h . η E V + P t E V , d c h / η E V . Δ t , ∀ t ∈ ( T a , T d ] (15) C E V , min ≤ C t E V ≤ C E V , max , ∀ t ∈ [ T a , T d ] (16) C t E V = C E V , max , i f t = T The equations of the EV are pretty similar to those of the ESS. The only difference is that these equations only work when the vehicle is plugged inside the home. 2.2.2 Uninterruptible loads (UL) There is another type of load the HEMS shifts the operating time thereof, but it cannot be stopped in the middle of the work. In other words, when these loads start working, they have to keep working until the end of their operation. Hence, these loads are called uninterruptible loads. Washing machines (WM), dishwashers (DW), and clothes dryers (CD) are examples of these loads. To investigate how they function, we assume that each load has different operational phases, each of which represents one of its operational stages. Each load also has a particular power consumption and execution time. These phases must be performed without interruption and consecutively until the load operation steps have been completed. The equations of uninterruptible loads are shown in (17)\u2013(25) (Savasci, 2018). (17) ∑ t = 1 T m i , j , t = P T i , j , ∀ i , j (18) m i , j , t + n i , j , t ≤ 1 , ∀ i,j,t (19) m i , j , t − 1 + m i , j , t ≤ n i , j , t , ∀ i,j,t : t > 1 (20) n i , j , t − 1 ≤ n i , j , t , ∀ i,j,t : t > 1 (21) m i , j , t ≤ n i , j − 1 , t , ∀ i,j,t : j > 1 (22) ∑ t = 1 T c i , j , t = P D i , j , ∀ i , j (23) c i , j , t = n i , j − 1 , t − ( m i , j , t − n i , j . t ) , ∀ i,j,t : j > 1 (24) ∑ j = 1 7 ( m i , j , t . P i , j U ) = P i , t U L 1 , ∀ i , t (25) ∑ i = 1 3 P i , t U L 1 = P t U L , ∀ t Eq. (17) denotes that each phase of each load should be completed in predefined time intervals. Based on (18), the state of a phase must be either on or off. Eq. (19) represents sequences in intervals of a phase and no interruption between them. Eq. (20) denotes that when a phase finishes, it does not start again. The continuity among sequential phases is represented by (21). The delays among the phases are calculated by (22) and (23), while the total power consumption is calculated by (24) and (25). 2.2.3 Thermostatically controlled loads (TCL) Loads such as air conditioners (AC) and electric water heaters (EWH), based on temperature regulation, are called thermostatically controlled loads. These appliances often work by continuously calculating the air and water temperature and considering the users' preferences. They start to increase the air or water temperature and satisfy the house occupants\u2019 comfort. 2.2.3.1 AC modeling The indoor temperature in homes is calculated by a linear equation that depends on the heat exchange between the internal and ambient environment of the house, thermal parameters of the air, and thermodynamic parameters of the house (Paterakis et al., 2015).

Eq. (27) is related to users' preferences because occupants choose the lowest and highest temperature by themselves. Eq. (28) represents the AC power consumption. 2.2.3.2 EWH modeling EWH is another substantial thermal load that prepares hot water whenever it is needed for taking a shower or other uses. To calculate the water temperature, two denoted equations are used. Eq. (29) is used when the earlier water use is zero. Eq. (30) is used when the water usage of previous times is not zero because in this situation, the EWH tank is empty and must be filled with inlet water. The hot water temperature is limited by considering users' preferences based on (31). The EWH power consumption is calculated at time t by (32) (Paterakis et al., 2015).

(33) is known as the power balance equation. This equation states that the total consumed power in smart homes should be equal to the total generation power. At some time intervals, the necessary power for different loads is more than the supplied power by DERs, so smart homes must draw power from the grid to compensate for this power shortage.

In this paper, this advantage is taken into consideration while the HEMS can sell extra power at some time intervals when the total produced power along with the ESS and EV discharge power are greater than the total amount of power required by the home loads. (34) P t s o l d = P t P V , s o l d + P t W T , s o l d + P t E V , s o l d + P t E S S , s o l d , ∀ t (35) P t G r ≤ P t G r , max . u t G r , ∀ t (36) P t s o l d ≤ P t s o l d , max . ( 1 − u t G r ) , ∀ t As shown in Eq. (34), a part of the output power of the PV and WT, as well as a part of the energy stored in the EV and ESS is sold to the grid. Based on (35) and (36), smart homes cannot sell and purchase power simultaneously. Also, the limit on the amount of transmission power, according to DR programs is expressed by (35) and (36). 2.5 Added restrictions in the second level All the mentioned equations, are used as constraints in the first-level optimization. In the second level, in addition to Eqs. (1)\u2013(36), the following ones must also be considered. (37) ( P t E S S ) 2 + ( Q t E S S ) 2 ≤ ( S E S S ) 2 , ∀ t (38) ( P t E V ) 2 + ( Q t E V ) 2 ≤ ( S E V ) 2 , ∀ t (39) ( P t G r ) 2 + ( Q t G r ) 2 ≤ ( S G r ) 2 , ∀ t (40) Q t G r + Q t E S S + Q t E V = t a n ( c o s - 1 P F I n f l e x ) .

P t E W H + ∑ i = 1 3 ( P i , t U L 1 . t a n _ U L i ) , \" t The ESS, EV, and smart home's apparent power is limited by Eqs. (37)\u2013(39). Eq. (40) shows that the total reactive power consumed in homes must be equal to the total input power from the utility and the power provided through the inverters at any time. EV and ESS inverters can absorb or inject reactive power. However, the critical point is that both inverters must work in the same operating mode so that the energy injected by one inverter is not absorbed in the other one. To prevent this, the equations mentioned in (Golshannavaz, 2018) are used. It should be noted that the existence of Eqs. (37)\u2013(39) causes the program to be nonlinear. To linearize it, it can be referred to (Hamidi, Golshannavaz, & Nazarpour, 2017), which provides a trapezoidal linearization method. 2.6 Objective functions As shown in Fig. 2 , in this paper, two objectives for the planning of home appliances by the SHEMS are considered at two levels, cost in the first level and PF in the second level. After implementing the first level, the minimum cost is obtained. At the second level, this obtained amount is used as a constraint. The second level of optimization is ready to be implemented by changing the objective function (minimizing the PF) and adding new equations for reactive power to the previous equations. 2.6.1 Cost (first level) The most important purpose of home appliance management by the SHEMS is to minimize household electricity prices using the following equation. In Eq. (41), pricet denotes the price of electricity according to the TOU or RTP pricing scheme, which is set by the main grid and sent to the HEMS.

Δ T , ∀ t 2.6.2 Power factor (second level) As previously explained, to increase the smart home power factor at the point of connection to the utility, it is necessary to supply the reactive power needed for home equipment through the EV and ESS inverters as much as possible as well as minimize the reactive power drawn from the utility based on Eq. (42) and all previous equations. (42) M i n i m i z e O F 2 = ∑ t = 1 T ( Q t G r ) . Δ T , ∀ t s u b j e c t to ( 1 ) − ( 40 ) O F 1 ¯ = ∑ t = 1 T ( P t G r − P t s o l d ) . p r i c e t . Δ T , ∀ t O F 1 ¯ ≤ O F 1 3 Simulation analysis and discussion As mentioned earlier, the proposed optimization program runs at two different levels. At the first level, the scheduling of appliances is done without applying reactive power equations to minimize the cost of electricity consumption. At this level, the smart home has no role in supplying the reactive power required by the equipment, and all this reactive power is taken from the grid. But at the second level, the desired purpose at the first level can be achieved and turn the smart home into an independent entity essentially providing reactive power by adding reactive power equations and changing the objective function and applying new constraints obtained from the first level. Before evaluating the results obtained from these two levels, it is noteworthy that the optimization problem is modeled by the MILP method, which has been solved by IBM ILOG CPLEX optimization studio 12.8.0 and runs on an Intel Core i5-7200U @ 3.1 GHz computer with 8 GB RAM. The simulation time in the basic scenario of the first level is 7:38 s and in the second level is 68:29 s (With the RTP pricing scheme). 3.1 Input data and assumption In this section, the efficiency of the proposed model is evaluated with a simulation example. First of all, it should be noted that planning is done over a day (24 h). The scheduling horizon starts at 7 AM, continues until 7 AM the next day, and is divided into 288 5-minute intervals. The output power of the PV and WT is shown in Fig. 3 (Tutkun, Can, & Şan, 2015). The total power consumption of non-schedulable loads is displayed in Fig. 4 . The names of these loads are listed in Table 1 , along with their relevant information. The EV and ESS information is provided in Table 2 . It can be seen from the data in Table 2 that the EV leaves the house at 7 AM. At 5 PM, it is connected to the grid immediately after returning to the house parking lot and can charge and discharge power and participate in energy management programs until 7 AM the next day. Tables 3 and 4 (Missaoui, Joumaa, Ploix, & Bacha, 2014) present information on thermal and uninterruptible loads, respectively. The graph related to the inlet water temperature to the EWH tank and the ambient temperature is shown in Fig. 5 (Paterakis et al., 2015). The amount of water consumed is also considered so that the people of the house take a shower at 7:50 AM, 1:30 PM, and 8:30 PM. Each shower lasts 10 min, and the shower flow is 2.5 gals/min. At 9 AM, 1 PM, 5 PM, and 10 PM, 5 gallons of water are used for other needs, each lasting 5 min. Finally, the price of electricity set by the main grid with the two pricing methods of TOU and RTP is specified in Fig. 6 (L. Zhou et al., 2018). 3.2 Results of first level As mentioned in Eqs. (1) and (2), the amount of power purchased and sold from/to the grid can be limited. These constraints, which are part of the DR programs, are set by the grid operator to maintain the grid parameters (voltages and currents) within the allowable range. Here are six different scenarios for examining the impact of these constraints on household cost, as well as its effects on a parameter called the load factor (LF). The assumptions made in each scenario are as follows. 1 The maximum allowable amount of power purchased from the grid is 2 kW, and the smart home cannot sell power to the grid. 2 The maximum allowable amount of power purchased from the grid is 4 kW, and the smart home cannot sell power to the grid. 3 There is no limit on the amount of power purchased, and no ability to sell power. 4 The maximum allowable amount of power purchased from the grid is 2 kW, and the smart home can sell power to the grid. 5 The maximum allowable amount of power purchased from the grid is 4 kW, and the smart home can sell power to the grid. 6 There is no limit on the amount of power purchased, and the smart home can sell power to the grid. (Base scenario) The numerical values obtained for cost and LF in different scenarios defined in the first level of optimization are given in Table 5 . Before evaluating the results, it is necessary to define a quantity called load factor (LF). As shown in Eq. (43), LF is defined as the ratio of the average net power drawn from the grid to the maximum amount of net power drawn from the grid. The higher this index, the flatter the smart home load profile. Increasing the LF is very important for reasons such as reducing production costs, reducing losses, etc. Therefore, by applying DR strategies, the grid tries to increase the LF and flatten the load profile of smart homes. (43) L F = a v g ( P G r − P s o l d ) max ( P G r − P s o l d ) As shown in the table above, in scenarios 1\u20133, the lower the power purchased from the grid, the higher the cost of smart home electricity and the LF, regardless of the pricing scheme. Therefore, it can be said that with the reduction of the power purchased from the grid, the load profile becomes flatter because inevitably, the performance of flexible loads is transferred from cheap periods to higher cost periods, which increases the cost paid by consumers. These results are also true for scenarios 4\u20136, with the difference that by adding the ability to sell power to the grid, the cost for the smart home is less than scenarios 1\u20133. It should be noted that the cost obtained in scenario 6 with RTP pricing method is used in the second level. The final planning performed by the HEMS is shown in Fig. 7 , in which the operating time for each load, as well as the charge and discharge time of the EV and ESS during a day, are specified. The columns above the x-axis are related to consumers, and those below the x-axis are related to power supplies and the input power from the grid. The equality of the total height of the upper and lower pillars indicates the equality of supply and demand at all times. By examining the price curve and the height of the columns, it can be seen that to reduce cost, HEMS has planned in such a way that more energy consumption is in the intervals where the price of electricity is lower. Therefore, in the time intervals of 1 PM to 6 PM and 1 AM to 7 AM, the height of the columns is more. Also, ESS and EV are charged during hours when energy is cheap and discharged during hours when electricity prices are high. Fig. 8 shows the power drawn from the grid and the energy sold to the grid at different times. As shown in the figure, the energy sold to the grid is the sum of the power output of the PV and WT and a part of the power discharged from the EV and ESS. What stands out in the figure is that buying and selling do not happen simultaneously. Figs. 9 and 10 illustrate how the ESS and EV work in 24 h. In both figures, there are three different states for the battery. When the battery is charging, its capacity increases and when it is discharging, its capacity decreases. Even if it is neither charged nor discharged, its capacity remains constant. During planning, the capacity does not exceed the desired limits. As shown in Fig. 10, the EV is out of the smart home from 7 AM to 5 PM and does not participate in planning; it arrives at home at 50 % capacity and is charged and discharged alternately until it finally leaves the house at total capacity after being unavailable for a while. In general, the SHEMS determines when the EV and ESS act as a consumer and act as a feeder according to the defined constraints to maintain the economic benefits. At the end of the first level, the AC and EWH performance is investigated based on Figs. 11 and 12 , respectively. As shown in Fig. 11, the room temperature should be between 24 °C and 26 °C according to the preference of smart home users. If the temperature rises, the AC turns on and sets the temperature between the two defined values. When home users use water in the shower and other daily requirements, the water temperature should be above 40 °C and below 60 °C. According to Fig. 12, the EWH turns on and increases the water temperature within the allowable range when water is needed. Therefore, it optimizes the defined objective functions in favor of the smart home with the planning done by the HEMS while meeting the needs of users to use the equipment. 3.3 Results of second level After reviewing the results obtained in the first level, the cost of scenario 6 is considered as a constraint in the second level, the objective function is changed, and new constraints are added. To evaluate the success of the second level in achieving its objective of improving the smart home PF at the point of connection to the grid, Figs. 13 and 14 are analyzed. In Fig. 13, the blue dotted line curve represents the reactive power input from the grid at the first level and the blue curve represents the reactive power required by the smart home. The convergence of the two confirms the statement that in the first level, the smart home draws all the reactive power it needs from the network. But the same power in the second level is provided jointly through ESS, EV, and input power from the grid. Due to the absence of the EV from 7 AM to 5 PM, the ESS alone is not able to provide this power and SHEMS inevitably seeks help from the grid, which reduces the PF of the smart home at this time. Fig. 14 also shows the rate of change of the PF from the first to the second level. By providing reactive power locally, the PFis increased and in most moments is equal to one. On average, it has increased from 0.65 to 0.94 in the second level. 4 Conclusion In this study, a two-level optimization programming modeled by MILP was proposed to manage and schedule different residential loads, EVs, ESSs, and DERs. The modeling of all appliances like interruptible, uninterruptible, and thermostatically controlled loads in addition to the local generations that give the SHEMS the ability to participate in price-based DR programs as well as exchange power with the utility was performed. The SHEMS has achieved the desired objectives, such as reducing the cost of payment and increasing the PF according to the users' preferences. By using a bidirectional inverter for the EV and ESS that injects the required reactive power, the PF of the house can be increased at the point connected to the utility. By observing the simulated results, the efficiency of the proposed system in achieving the desired objectives can be proved. Numerically, despite the existence of different types of residential loads in the optimization program, the values obtained for the payment cost were optimal compared to other studies. Also, while achieving this optimal value in cost, the PF has also increased significantly. Therefore, using the method presented in this paper ensures economic and technical benefits for both consumers and the utility.

This paper proposes a two-level optimization algorithm for the energy management of residential appliances within a smart home, including interruptible, uninterruptible, thermostatically controlled, and non-schedulable loads, as well as the charging/discharging strategies of electric vehicles (EVs) and energy storage systems (ESSs) in the presence of distributed energy resources (DERs). In the first level of optimization, to minimize the cost of electricity, the operating time of smart home components is determined by SHEMS, and active power is exchanged between equipment. At this level, the impact of demand response (DR) constraints on the cost and load factor (LF) of the smart home have also been investigated. In the second level, considering the optimal cost obtained in the first level, in addition to the active power, the reactive power required by loads is also provided by using the additional capacity of EV and ESS inverters and improves the power factor (PF) of the house at the connection point to the grid. Day-ahead electricity costs are calculated depending on different pricing signals (TOU, RTP) with the power exchange capacity (buying/ selling) with the grid. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is examined on a typical smart home over a 24-h. By reviewing the numerical results obtained for the cost and the LF in different scenarios, and observing the increase of the PF of home from 0.65 to 0.94 and also examining the performance of the equipment during the planning time, the efficiency of the model is proved.",
