Editor name: Prof. S.K. Chou As building energy management systems are widely applied, a large amount of operational data can be acquired and utilized for building load forecasting and energy system control. However, there's a lack of methods for assessing the completeness of operational data sets and the requisite data quality for various control models. Without these assessments, addressing the loss of model accuracy due to fluctuations in data quality becomes challenging, resulting in deviations from actual operating conditions and decreased control performance. To bridge the gaps, a clustering method is employed to categorize load forecasting training dataset into high and low completeness categories. By matching a reinforcement learning control model combining transfer learning and imitation learning to low completeness datasets and a model-based optimization control model to high completeness datasets, an adaptive switching control model is proposed for air conditioning systems in this study. Case study demonstrates that employing transfer imitation learning results in an 11.5% higher operation benefit compared to model-based optimization under low completeness data conditions. The adaptive switching control model can further reduce operational costs by 5.5% and energy consumption by 5.0% compared to the single control models using only model-based optimization or transfer imitation learning. Data availability The authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used. 1 Introduction 1.1 Background As renewable energy becomes more prevalent and global electricity demand increases, the intermittency and uncertainty of renewable energy sources, along with the growth of peak grid loads, pose challenges to the reliability and stability of the grid [1]. Energy consumption in buildings accounts for about 40% of total global energy consumption [2]，with electricity consumed by buildings forms nearly 80% of peak demand in grid operation [3]. Therefore, building energy systems have significant energy-saving potential and the potential to participate in demand response. Traditional control methods based on operational personnel experience struggle to cope with complex and dynamic operational conditions. Consequently, there's a growing need to find flexible approaches to automate control of building energy systems, ensuring comfort while enabling responsive operation control on the building load side to meet grid control demands. The widespread adoption and ongoing enhancement of energy monitoring systems in buildings result in an increasing abundance of operational data [4]. Data-driven models for building and equipment can be more accurately established based on historical operational data, facilitating improved optimization objectives. However, challenges arise from the accuracy of control models and the reliance of data-driven systems on the quantity and quality of input and output data, hindering the application of model-based control methods in real-world buildings [5]. Fluctuations in data quality frequently impede a single control model's ability to adapt, leading to suboptimal overall control performance. When handling vast datasets, evaluating their quality and completeness enables the flexible allocation of different control models based on data conditions and operational scenarios. Thus, reducing the impact of data quality fluctuations on control effectiveness becomes increasingly significant. 1.2 Literature review 1.2.1 Data information quality and load forecasting The quality of the dataset can profoundly affect the prediction accuracy of the data-driven model. When redundancy occurs within the dataset, methods like correlation analysis are employed to select features highly correlated with the load. Furthermore, dimensionality reduction techniques are used to alleviate multicollinearity stemming from redundant information in the input features. Peng introduced the maximum relevance minimum redundancy algorithm (mRMR), which ensures features have maximum correlation with the load while minimizing redundancy. This approach reduces the adverse effects of multicollinearity among features on the forecasting outcomes [6]. When data scarcity occurs, transfer learning is introduced as a method to supplement information. Lu et al. pre-trained the forecasting model using transfer learning. They proposed a Similarity Measurement Index (SMI) to select source domain data similar to the target domain data, supplementing insufficient information in buildings and reducing thermal load forecasting errors by 0.6% to 15.26% [7]. The similarity and correlation between the training and forecasting sets, impacts data quality and, consequently, the accuracy of load forecasting. Xiang et al. computed the similarity between features in the training and forecasting sets, assigning weights to training samples to augment the likelihood of extracting pivotal samples. As a result, this method effectively lowered the MAPE of electricity load forecasting to 3.3% [8]. Saurette et al. quantified the richness of training sample information using statistical metrics. They established a distribution difference index to measure the difference in information contained in the training set samples and the overall samples. As the sample size increases, the information difference index decreases. When the reduction in information difference falls below 5%, the training set reaches the optimal sample size [9]. 1.2.2 Control method of air conditioning system Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) stand out as two advanced models with promising applications in the field of HVAC system control. MPC offer the flexibility to establish operational objectives and optimize system operation and control strategies, which relies on accurate models representing complex nonlinear systems, disturbance forecasting, and optimization algorithms [10]. Existing studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of MPC. However, when data quality cannot support model development, the application of model-based methods will be limited. Ceuster applied linear MPC in integrated energy system management. It was observed that deviations of 8%\u201312% in energy demand and 36%\u201337% in weather forecast distributions, compared to accurate forecasting, resulted in a 10.1% decline in MPC control performance [11]. Ma et al. pointed out that uncertainties in meteorological parameters will reduce MPC performance due to errors in heating load and renewable energy forecasting. Through the introduction of historical errors into rolling optimization for online correction to enhance forecasting accuracy, the case study revealed that neglecting the correction mechanism led to a 1.9% to 2% increase in operating costs when utilizing forecasting with significant errors in renewable energy and load forecasts for model predictive control [12]. In reinforcement learning (RL) and other learning-based control methods, agents interact directly with the environment, exploring and exchanging state, action, and reward information. They can learn optimal control strategies without requiring explicit dynamic models, using only simulated or real data to train learning agents [13]. Although RL does not require detailed mathematical models, it requires extensive data for training, and faces challenges such as low sample efficiency, unstable initial training, the curse of dimensionality, and difficulty in reward shaping [14]. Due to the instability in the initial stages of RL training and the lengthy training time, achieving satisfactory control outcomes may be challenging. Therefore, transfer learning is often introduced into RL to enhance the performance of agents during early deployment and shorten the time for agents to reach optimal states. Differences in climate, human activity patterns, and building characteristics between the source and target domains can influence the effectiveness of transfer learning. Coraci et al. used transfer reinforcement learning to control the operation mode switching of energy storage systems and compared differences between source and target domains from four aspects: meteorological conditions, electricity price, occupancy rates, and envelope efficiency. Meteorological conditions emerged as the most crucial factor influencing transfer learning effectiveness. Case studies demonstrated that the proposed online transfer reinforcement learning method reduced electricity costs by 20% compared to traditional rule-based control and reduced temperature discomfort violations by 50% [15]. Fang et al. used parameter-based transfer reinforcement learning to control the supply air temperature and chilled water temperature in office building HVAC systems and analyzed the impact of climate differences between source and target domains on transfer learning effectiveness. When source and target domain buildings are in the same climate zone, the transfer of strategies performs better. In contrast to solely training the RL model online, this approach can enhance training efficiency by up to 13.28% [16]. 1.2.3 Comparative and integrated control method When historical data and information are sufficient for building and equipment model establishment, model-based optimization methods exhibit efficiency in searching for global optimal solutions [17]. Compared to model-free control methods for building energy systems, model-based methods can achieve better operational performance. Stoffel et al. compared the performance of black-box, gray-box, and white-box MPC with model-free methods in AHU set temperature control. With a low AHU load forecasting error of 0.125 kW, black-box MPC can save energy by 1.3% compared to model-free methods and can meet indoor comfort requirements [18]. Wang et al. used a 1R1C thermal capacitance-resistance model for MPC forecasting and employed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) for controlling heat pump output power during the heating season. In the case study, DDPG's estimator searched over larger action-state spaces and was less efficient than MPC in directly searching for optimal values [19]. When model-based optimization methods are constrained by model performance, model-free reinforcement learning can leverage its strong exploration capabilities and achieve good performance. Ceuster applied Linear MPC and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithms in comprehensive energy system management. LMPC with perfect forecasting improved control performance by 5.4% compared to TD3. However, when energy demand and weather forecasting errors are present, LMPC's control performance decreases by 10.1%, falling behind the TD3 algorithm [11]. Peirelinck et al. controlled the heating power of electric water heaters using reinforcement learning and compared it with MPC. When there are errors in the heat transfer model of the electric water heater, the proposed reinforcement learning method can save 26% in operating costs compared to MPC [20]. Mixing model-based optimization control methods with reinforcement learning and other control methods can reduce reliance on system and building models and combine the relative advantages of different methods to improve control effectiveness. Arroyo et al. employed a thermal capacitance-resistance (RC) model in their MPC controllers. Unlike traditional MPC, this model forecasts only the current step's operating parameters, with future state forecasting relying on reinforcement learning's state value functions. Integrating MPC with reinforcement learning mitigates multiple-step forecasting errors arising from inaccurate RC models. Case simulations demonstrate that the control effectiveness of RL-MPC hybrid methods on room temperature closely matches that of ideal MPC control effects [21]. O'Malley et al. integrated reinforcement learning with Mixed Integer Programming (MIP), employing reinforcement learning for environmental exploration and perception to create eight executable policies for the following day. MIP then selects and optimizes policies within the executable framework. MIP can handle multiple constraints and seek optimal solutions within these constraints, effectively addressing the variability inherent in reinforcement learning [22]. Stoffel et al. employed a black-box approach to pinpoint suitable operating conditions for MPC adaptation. They discovered that during initial deployment, the MPC's forecasting model often lacks training data for all operating conditions, resulting in unreliable load forecasting for unfamiliar scenarios. They trained a k-nearest neighbor classifier using the out-of-range dataset to create an effective domain classifier for identifying unknown conditions. A fixed setpoint backup controller takes over to regulate the heat pump power instead of the MPC algorithm. This strategy, compared to MPC without switching, can reduce cumulative discomfort during the heating season testing phase by 85.6% [23]. 1.3 Research contributions From the literature review, several research gaps can be found in the load forecasting and control method of air conditioning system operation: (1) Limited research offers methods to evaluate the quality of training datasets, hindering the ability to ascertain the completeness of information relative to the forecasting day. Consequently, it's challenging to determine whether existing datasets can effectively train high-precision data-driven forecasting models. (2) In the utilization of model-based optimization techniques for air conditioning system control, the accuracy of the model is compromised by low-quality data, resulting in diminished control performance. Similarly, applying reinforcement learning under conditions of low data quality leads to unstable control performance during the training process, posing challenges for practical applications. (3) Current research lacks a mechanism to seamlessly integrate model-based optimization with transfer reinforcement learning methods to mitigate the impact of variations in operating conditions and data quality on scheduling control effectiveness. Considering the research gaps, a control model switching method based on data completeness assessment is introduced in this study, offering the following contributions: (1) To tackle the absence of methods for evaluating dataset information quality, a method to assess data completeness is proposed. This facilitates a preliminary assessment of whether the training dataset quality is sufficient for building high-precision load forecasting models. (2) For low-quality data conditions, transfer reinforcement learning is employed to supplement information and improve control effectiveness. A domain similarity test method is established to select the source domain for transfer. Additionally, a combination of imitation learning and DQN is utilized to enhance online training efficiency. (3) A control model switching method is developed to accommodate changes in data quality. By leveraging historical operational data, the accuracy of load forecasting models is assessed in advance using the data completeness evaluation method. This guides the transition between model-based optimization methods and transfer imitation learning methods deployed during operational days, ensuring the adaptability of control strategies to varying operating conditions. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the main structure of the adaptive switching control method. Section 3 describes specific implementation cases of the adaptive switching control model through case studies. Section 4 presents the results and discusses the analysis of the case studies. Section 5 provides the conclusion. 2 Methodology The research roadmap outlined in Fig. 1 comprises the following key steps: (1) Information completeness judgment method: This involves establishing training set-forecasting set information completeness indexes and categorize datasets as either high or low completeness by clustering. (2) Development of reinforcement learning incorporating transfer and imitation learning: A method leveraging cross-spectral analysis is proposed to assess domain similarity, aiding in the selection of suitable transfer source domains. Subsequently, a model parameter-based approach facilitates the transfer of DQN model. Additionally, imitation learning is integrated to bolster online training efficiency. (3) Creation of an adaptive control model switching method: Based on the outcomes of the information completeness judgment, the control model is pre-determined. For datasets with high completeness, a model-based optimization approach is utilized for control; conversely, transfer imitation learning is employed. 2.1 Information completeness judgment method To build the difference index between the training and forecasting set data, including external disturbance, internal disturbance and historical similar days: (1)External disturbance difference index. Given two probability distributions, Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence can be used to quantify the difference between the distributions [9], and the KL divergence calculation formula is shown in the equation: (1) D KL P Q = ∑ i P x i ⋅ log P x i Q x i where, P x i and Q x i are the probability densities of distributions P and Q respectively. However, D KL is asymmetry, and there is no upper limit to the simultaneous value, which makes it cannot directly represent the distance between the two distributions. Therefore, the Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence is introduced and calculated as follows: (2) D JS P Q = 0.5 ⋅ D KL P M + 0.5 ⋅ D KL Q M (3) M = 1 2 P + Q JS divergence is symmetric and ranges from 0 to 1. It serves as a quantitative index of distribution difference, measuring the distance between the training set and the forecasting set of externally disturbed variables. Selecting the distribution of external disturbance variables for the i-th forecast day as distribution P i , and the distribution of external disturbance variables for the training set as distribution Q i , calculate their JS divergence as the difference between the distribution of the j-th external disturbance variable in the forecasting set and the training set, denoted as D JS P i , j Q i , j . Then the external disturbance difference index J S i of the i-th forecasting day is calculated as follows: (4) JS i = ∑ j = 1 m D JS P i , j Q i , j / m where m is the number of external disturbance variables. (2)Internal disturbance difference index. Performing wavelet transform on the load curve, the high-frequency signal obtained is correlated with indoor occupant activities, according to the wavelet transform method described in [24] the high-frequency signal obtained is denoted as d 1 , and its fluctuation is correlated with changes in the occupancy rate. Selecting the coefficient of variation (CV) to reflect the volatility of the d 1 sequence in the training set. The CV is calculated as follows in eq. (5): (5) CV = σ Q ¯ where σ is the variance of the d 1 sequence in the training set, and Q ¯ is the mean of the d 1 sequence in the training set. The value of CV lies between 0 and 1. A smaller CV indicates that the standard deviation of the dataset relative to the mean is smaller, indicating less volatility in the d 1 sequence. Therefore, the uncertainty of internal disturbances is smaller, and data-driven models can induce the variation patterns of internal disturbances from the training set. For the i-th forecast day, the high-frequency signal d 1 , i is obtained from its training set load curve, and the variance σ i and mean Q i ¯ of the high-frequency signal are obtained. According to eq. (5), the intra-disturbance distinctiveness indicator C V i for the i-th forecast day in the training set can be calculated. (3)Difference index of historical similarity day. Historical load on similar days can reflect load patterns under similar operating conditions. To ensure that the load on similar days and the forecast day have similar variation patterns, it is necessary to establish indicators to quantify the similarity of their operating conditions. Normalizing features such as weather, date, and occupancy rate can form a historical similar day feature vector X i = x i , 1 x i , 2 \u2026 x i , m for the i-th day, which includes information about operating conditions. Cosine similarity cos i j can be used to measure the similarity of vectors composed of multiple indicators, based on the angle between the two vectors, avoiding interference from vector length. The formula for calculating the cosine similarity cos i j between the i-th and j-th days is shown in eq. (6). (6) cos i j = X i ⋅ X j X i 2 X j 2 The value of cos i j approaching 1 indicates high similarity between the two vectors. When cos i j approaches 0, there is no similarity between the vectors. If cos i j approaches −1, it indicates that the two vectors are negatively correlated. Furthermore, introducing cosine distance ensures that similarity and metric indicators have the same trend of change. The formula for calculating the cosine distance between the i-th and j-th days is as follows: (7) H ij = 1 − cos i j Select a historical similar day within k days before the i-th forecast date to ensure that the cosine distance between the historical similar day and the forecast day is minimum, that is: (8) H i = min H i , 1 H i , 2 \u2026 H i , j \u2026 H i , k where H i , j represents the cosine distance between the j-th day before the i-th forecast day and the forecast day. Selecting H_i as the historical similar day distinctiveness indicator can determine whether the data-driven model can induce the correct load variation pattern from historical similar days. By combining the three types of indicators, an information completeness indicator c _ i = JS _ i CV _ i H _ i can be obtained. Using unsupervised learning clustering algorithms, the historical data of indicator c _ i is classified. This study employs a spectral clustering algorithm based on spectral graph theory to mitigate the computational load resulting from multi-dimensional parameters and the impact of complex distribution shapes on clustering outcomes [25]. Ultimately, spectral clustering categorizes the information completeness indicators into two groups, leading to the division of corresponding training set-forecasting set historical data into two categories: low completeness datasets and high completeness datasets. 2.2 Transfer and imitation learning methods 2.2.1 Domain similarity test Before implementing transfer learning, it is necessary to assess the similarity between the source domain and the target domain to avoid negative transfer. The K-means clustering algorithm is used to identify typical load patterns in the source and target domains. Cross spectrum is utilized to quantify the differences between typical load patterns in the source and target domains. Based on the quantitative indicators of differences, the source building that best matches the characteristics of the target domain is selected. Cross spectrum serves as a method to measure the similarity of shapes between two curves including the coherence spectrum and phase spectrum of two load sequences. The coherence spectrum identifies the frequency-domain correlation between two-time sequences, while the phase spectrum determines the lead-lag relationship of the curves in the frequency domain. A coherence spectrum value close to 1 indicates a strong correlation between the two sequences at that frequency. The phase spectrum reflects the phase difference between the two sequences at each frequency, indicating the degree of leading or lagging. A phase spectrum value close to 0 indicates weak leading or lagging at that frequency. The specific calculation methods are described in [26]. Normalizing the coherence spectrum values and phase spectrum values and then calculating the difference between them can assess the similarity between the two curves. The calculation method is as follows: (9) Δ = norm w i − norm b i where Δ represents the normalized difference obtained from cross spectrum analysis, Δ ∈ 0 1 norm w i is the normalized coherence spectrum value of the i-th typical curve in the target domain relative to the source domain curve, w i ∈ 0 1 ; b i represents the normalized phase spectrum value of the i-th typical load curve in the target domain relative to the source domain load curve, b i ∈ 0 1 . A larger normalized difference value closer to 1 indicates a higher degree of similarity between the two curves. Using the Calinski-Harabasz method, the number of typical load patterns in the target domain and each source domain is calculated. Then, the K-means clustering method is employed to obtain the sets of typical load curves in the target domain c i t i = 1 n t and each source domain c j s , p j = 1 n s , p . Where c i t and c j s , p represent the i-th typical load curve in the target domain and the j-th typical load curve in the p-th source domain, respectively. n t and n s , p denote the number of typical load patterns in the target domain and the p-th source domain, respectively. Normalization is applied to the set of typical load curves. Based on the normalized difference indicator obtained from cross spectrum analysis, the most similar load patterns can be selected from each source domain for the target domain. For the i-th typical pattern in the target domain, the similar load pattern c m i s , p selected from the p-th source domain satisfies the condition in eq. (10): (10) c m i s , p = argmax m i Δ c j s , p c i t s . t . c m i s , p ∈ c j s , p j = 1 n s , p Eq. (10) indicates that the maximum normalized difference obtained from cross spectrum analysis between the i-th typical curve c i t in the target domain and the p-th typical load curve c m i s , p in the p-th source domain signifies the highest similarity between the two typical load patterns. At this point, the similarity indicator D i , p is obtained, where: (11) D i , p = Δ c m i s , p c i t By applying eqs. (10) and (11) to obtain similarity indicators for all typical curves in the target domain regarding the p-th source domain and weighting them, the similarity indicator D p for the target domain concerning the p-th source domain can be obtained as shown in eq. (12). (12) D p = ∑ i = 1 n t D i , p ⋅ ω i where, ω i represents the weight of the i-th typical pattern, where the weight value is the proportion of the number of load curves under the i-th typical pattern. Selecting the q-th source domain from the source domains as the transfer source domain is subject to the condition expressed in eq. (13). (13) q = arg max D p s . t q ∈ 1 P That is, the q-th source domain is chosen from P source domains based on maximum similarity indicators, indicating that the building. 2.2.2 Transfer reinforcement learning method In this study, model parameter-based transfer reinforcement learning is chosen as the transfer model. The Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm [27] is employed to estimate the value function Q s a . In model parameter-based transfer learning, the neural network parameters are trained in the source domain. Subsequently, part of the hidden layer parameters is frozen, and the remaining neural network parameters are fine-tuned in the target domain. Let the source domain network parameters be denoted as w S = w S 1 w S 2 w S 3 w S 4 and b S = b S 1 b S 2 b S 3 b S 4 . After transfer, the first and second-layer networks are frozen, and the third and fourth-layer network parameters are trained in the target domain. Therefore, the target domain network parameters become w T = w S 1 w S 2 w T 3 w T 4 and b T = b S 1 b S 2 b T 3 b T 4 . The relationship of network transmission in the target domain can be expressed as eq. (14): (14) Y T 1 = g w S 1 X + b S 1 Y T 2 = g w S 2 Y T 1 + b S 2 Y T 3 = g w T 3 Y T 2 + b T 3 Q = g w T 4 Y T 3 + b T 4 Here, X represents the input state, Y represents the output of each layer, g · denotes the activation function, and Q represents the output Q value. After model parameter transfer, the first two layers of the neural network retain the knowledge obtained from training in the source domain, fine-tuning training of the last two layers' parameters allows the Q-network to learn knowledge about the target domain. 2.2.3 Imitation learning method The demonstration learning loss function, which is related to expert actions, is introduced into the gradient calculation of the agent network. The loss function for batch training samples is represented as eq. (15) (15) L lfd = − ∑ i = 1 N D f π s i θ π a i where, N D represents the number of samples taken from the experience pool, π s i θ π denotes the policy of the agent for the i-th sample, and a i represents the expert policy for the i-th sample. Therefore, the update process of the agent network parameters θ π is illustrated in eq. (16) (16) θ π t + 1 = θ π t − α ⋅ λ 1 ∇ θ π J + λ 2 ∇ θ π L lfd Here, α is the learning rate, λ 1 and λ 2 are weight coefficients, and J represents the reinforcement learning loss function. In eq. (16), in addition to optimizing the reinforcement learning loss function, the demonstration learning loss function is also optimized. This allows the expert policy to be incorporated into the update of the agent network. The imitation learning loss function in this study is introduced in Appendix B. 2.3 Adaptive control model switching method 2.3.1 Model-based optimization method For air conditioning system optimization, the model establishment includes establishing models for building load forecasting and equipment. The optimization problem can be summarized as eq. (17), (17) minF X = min f 1 X f 2 X \u2026 f n X s . t . g j X ⩽ 0 j = 1 , 2 , \u2026 , p h k X = 0 k = 1 , 2 , \u2026 , q where f X represents the objective function of air conditioning system optimization; g j X are the inequality constraint, h k X are the equality constraints in optimization. The specific process includes the following steps: 1) Input relevant operating data and forecast the building cooling load for a time window of length T. In this study, the time interval is 0.5 h, and T is 20. 2) Based on the forecasting results and the air conditioning system model, optimize the control variables for the next T time intervals to minimize the objective function while satisfying constraints. 3) Implement the optimized control signal as scheduling control signals for the air conditioning system for the first control variable in the time window. 4) Update the operating data, repeat steps 1) to 4), and complete rolling forecasting optimization. In this study, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) [28] is used as the cooling load forecasting model. Gray-box modeling is employed to characterize the main equipment of the air conditioning system. Using measured operating data, the parameters of the gray-box model are regressed using the Least Squares method. Appendix A provides a specific description of the optimization problem in this study. 2.3.2 Adaptive control model switching process As shown in the Fig. 2 , the process includes two layers of loop: the outer loop is used to determine the model switching, including executing information completeness judgment, dataset updating, and XGBoost load forecasting model training update. The outer loop performs actions at the beginning of each day, pre-judging the completeness of the training set for the daily load forecasting, and if the judgment result indicates high completeness, the model-based optimization method is chosen for the inner loop; otherwise, transfer imitation learning is selected, and the training dataset is updated simultaneously. The inner loop iterates once for each control time step, scheduling the equipment, including running model-based optimization algorithms and reinforcement learning algorithms, and maintaining rolling updates of operational parameters. 3 Case study 3.1 Case building overview An office building located in Tianjin, China, with three floors above ground and a total floor area of 3970.5 square meters, is selected as the case building, as shown in Fig. 3 . The occupancy hours of the building lasts from 8:00 to 20:00. The terminal of the building's HVAC system adopts a Variable Air Volume system. On the energy system side, one screw-type air-cooled chiller units are used, and a thermal energy storage tank is installed. A schematic of the HVAC system is also shown in Fig. 3. The HVAC system operates in two modes: daytime from 6:00 to 21:00 and nighttime from 22:00 to 6:00 the following day. During the daytime mode, the chiller units provide cooling capacity either independently or in conjunction with the thermal energy storage tank. In the nighttime mode, the indoor HVAC terminals are deactivated. The chiller units provide cooling capacity to the storage. The meteorological data, occupancy rate and energy consumption of the building in the cooling season are measured for load prediction and verification of the information completeness method, and for the verification of the simulation model. The building is modeled by EnergyPlus. With the same meteorological, occupancy rate and control strategy boundaries as the field testing, the errors of NMBE and CV-RMSE of air conditioning system energy consumption of the case building model are 2.41% and 14.63% respectively, both of which meet the limits of NMBE <10% and CV-RMSE <30% stipulated in ASHRAE standard. The building and equipment simulation system is used to test and evaluate control strategies. To enable real-time interaction between the scheduling control algorithm model and the case study building, the EnergyPlus model is connected to the Python via FMU. A baseline strategy is set: the indoor temperature setpoint is kept constant at 25 °C, the chilled water supply temperature of the chiller unit remains constant at 7 °C during working hours, and the thermal energy storage tank remains inactive. The benefit indicator B is defined as a comprehensive metric in Eq. (18). The control effect is measured by the percentage increase in the benefit indicator value of the optimization strategy relative to the baseline strategy, as shown in Eq. (19). (18) B = α 1 ⋅ f 1 + α 2 ⋅ f 2 + α 3 ⋅ f 3 (19) δB = B baseline − B B baseline ⋅ 100 % f 1 , f 2 , f 3 represent comfort, operational cost saving and energy saving indexes respectively, which are described in Appendix A. α 1 α 2 α 3 are the weight coefficient. B baseline is the baseline benefit index，B is the benefit index value of optimal control. 3.2 Load forecasting model and information completeness judgment setting To establish the cooling load forecasting model, the first step is to select input features using the mRMR method. The input features of the prediction model are determined as follows: outdoor dry bulb temperature, indoor dry bulb temperature, solar radiation intensity, relative humidity, electricity consumption of outlets, historical similar day load. The data from the previous 14 days of the case study building are selected as the training set. To ensure that the forecasting model can adapt to daily environmental changes, the model is retrained after each daily forecasting to update the forecasting model. In the daily forecast, the building cooling load for the next time step is predicted with a time interval of 30 min. Using the calculation method described in Section 2.1. Outdoor dry bulb temperature, solar radiation intensity, and outdoor humidity are selected, histogram methods are applied to obtain statistical models of these variables for the training set and the prediction set, respectively. And then calculate JS divergence between training set and the forecasting day and obtain the external disturbance difference indicator. The training set load curve is decomposed into high-frequency signals using wavelet decomposition and reconstructed, then CV is calculated to obtain the internal disturbance difference indicator. Outdoor dry bulb, date, and occupancy rate is select to form a historical similar day feature vector and cosine distance H between the forecasting day and historical similar days is calculated to obtain the historical similar-day difference indicator. These three types of indicators are combined to form an information difference index, and historical data of the indicators are used for spectral clustering to determine the completeness of information for the training set data used for the forecasting day. 3.3 Transfer reinforcement learning settings The control of the air conditioning system in this study is divided into three agents, each responsible for scheduling and controlling the operating parameters of the indoor temperature controller, the thermal energy storage tank, and the chiller unit, respectively. 1) Agent A estimates the optimal temperature setpoint T in , set at the current time 2) Agent B schedules the discharge of thermal energy from the thermal storage tank at the current time. 3) Agent C controls the setpoint of the chilled water outlet temperature of the chiller unit. The Markov decision processes of each agent are detailed in Appendix B. Three offline reinforcement learning models with different characteristics are established based on source domain buildings. These source domain buildings are constructed using the DOE building model consisting of a 3-story office building divided into exterior zones in four directions and a central core area, which is shown in Fig. 4 . To maintain consistency in control methods, the source domain buildings have the same air conditioning system components and time-of-use electricity prices as the target building. They also have identical start and stop times for the air conditioning system operation. The differences between the source domain buildings lie in the building envelope appearance, climate zones and variations in occupancy patterns. The distinctions between the target building and the source domains are illustrated in Table 1 . Source domain A represents a source domain with similar climate zones and occupancy patterns, source domain B represents a source domain with similar climate zones but different occupancy patterns, and source domain C represents a source domain with different climate zones but similar occupancy patterns. In Fig. 5 , the occupant activities in target building and source domain B are obtained through field investigation, and the activity schedule of source domain A and source domain C is the same as that of target building. 4 Results and discussion 4.1 Information completeness judgment Load forecast is carried out, and the forecast error CV-RMSE is calculated for comparison. To set 30% as the threshold of CV-RMSE, the cooling load forecasting results are divided into two sets: acceptable and unacceptable, as shown in Fig. 6(a). Additionally, through the method of information completeness judgment, the training datasets are divided into high completeness dataset and low completeness dataset, as illustrated in Fig. 6(b). The three-dimensional vector c = JS CV H in the figure corresponds to external disturbance difference, internal disturbance difference and difference of historical similarity day. In Fig. 6(a), the points where CV-RMSE is less than the threshold are mainly located at smaller values of each indicator, indicating that good forecasting results are usually obtained when the differences in indicators are small. However, when the external disturbance difference indicator JS is >0.6 or the internal disturbance difference indicator CV is >0.7, the probability of forecasting results exceeding the CV-RMSE threshold significantly increases. This discrepancy arises due to differing distributions of meteorological parameters between the training and test sets. Consequently, the forecasting model struggles to capture the evolving patterns of weather conditions, leading to inaccuracies in load forecasting. Moreover, the considerable uncertainty surrounding occupancy rates poses a challenge for the load forecasting model to learn the trends in occupancy changes during training. Similarly, differences in historical similar days also affect forecasting accuracy. In Fig. 6(a), despite the high external and internal disturbance differences, the forecasting results of some data points can still be accepted, as indicated by the JS-H and H-CV axes, where the historical similar day difference indicators are at low levels. This implies that when the external and internal disturbance differences are large, but the forecast day is similar to historical similar days, the forecasting model can still extract information from historical load data, mitigating the adverse effects of poor information quality in the training set on external and internal disturbances. Comparing Figs. 6(a)and 6(b), the clustering results are generally consistent with the classification results based on the CV-RMSE threshold Combining the statistical results of the box plot in Fig. 7 , the CV-RMSE values for the high completeness dataset are within the acceptable range. However, for the low completeness dataset, the results prejudged by the spectral clustering method may not fully correspond with the post-judge index CV-RMSE. For example, data points exhibiting external disturbance difference indicator JS ranging from 0.2 to 0.4 and internal disturbance difference indicator CV ranging from 0.6 to 0.8 labeled as the low completeness dataset may belongs to the acceptable CV-RMSE clusters in Fig. 6. In Fig. 7, a comparison of the forecasting errors reveals that the overall error of the high completeness clustering is lower than that of the low completeness clustering. Specifically, the average error CV-RMSE for the high completeness clustering is 15.4%, whereas for the low completeness clustering, it is 38.4%. Thus, the high completeness dataset yields more accurate forecasting results. Furthermore, the maximum CV-RMSE indicator in the high completeness clustering is 29.8%, implying that all data points in this cluster meet the engineering accuracy requirements. Using the information completeness judgment method can thus select datasets with high information quality, ensuring the establishment of accurate forecasting models. In contrast, the maximum CV-RMSE indicator in the low completeness clustering is 71.4%, with the upper quartile error exceeding 40%. Forecasting models based on low completeness datasets are therefore not suitable for directly use. Comparing with the baseline strategies, the benefits δB of using high completeness and low completeness datasets for the subsequent improvement in the control of the air conditioning system through model-based optimization methods are also shown in Fig. 7. The average benefit improvement when using high completeness datasets for optimization control is 20.9%, whereas for low completeness datasets, it is only 7.5%. 4.2 Effect of transfer imitative learning 4.2.1 Domain similarity test EnergyPlus is used to simulate the three source domains and target domains, with the simulation period set from July 1 to August 29 to obtain the summer cooling load. The K-means algorithm is used to determine the typical load curve pattern of the target domain and the source domain, with K = 3 being determined. The cross-spectrum method is then utilized to calculate the coherence spectral density and phase spectral density, facilitating the analysis of the load curves of both the target domain and the source domains. Fig. 8 shows the coherence spectrum and phase spectrum between the target domain and the source domain A, B, and C, respectively. The coherence spectrum analysis, as illustrated in Fig. 8, indicates that the coherence between source building B and the target building is higher in the middle and low-frequency bands (below 0.3) compared to source building A and C. Conversely, in the high-frequency band, source domain B exhibits lower coherence than source domains A and C. According to references [24,29], the middle and low-frequency components of the decomposed load time signal curve reflect the overall trend and gradual changes in load, whereas the high-frequency components are associated with sudden or random load variations. Consequently, the low-frequency part is significantly influenced by intrinsic, cyclical, and gradual factors such as building structures, meteorological conditions and periodic occupancy patterns. In contrast, the high-frequency part is predominantly affected by instantaneous usage patterns, such as occupant entrance/exit and equipment start/stop. Despite source buildings A and C having occupancy patterns same as the target domain, the meteorological data for source building B is identical to that of the target building. This similarity contributes to the higher coherence spectrum values of source building B and greater similarity in the middle and low-frequency parts. However, due to the consistent occupancy patterns, the coherence spectrum values between buildings A, C, and the target building are higher in the high-frequency band, primarily driven by abrupt load changes caused by occupancy patterns. Discrepancies in meteorological conditions and occupant schedules can either advance or delay changes in the load curve, which is reflected in the phase difference value. It is difficult to determine the optimal source domain only based on the qualitative analysis of the figure. To comprehensively consider the interaction of various factors, the spectrum normalization difference index is calculated according to the method described in section 2.2.1, which are presented in Table 2 . The results in Table 2 indicate that the spectrum normalization difference index of source domain A is greater than that of source domains B and C. Source domain A shares more similarities in terms of meteorological and occupancy conditions with the target domain, rendering it the most analogous to the target domain. To validate the enhancement effect of domain similarity test on transfer reinforcement learning, DQN intelligent agents are trained offline with source domains A, B, and C. The hidden layers of the intelligent agent networks are transferred to the target domain buildings. The intelligent agents within the source domains underwent online training and adjustments, while the air conditioning systems' scheduling control in the case buildings is executed, yielding observable operational effects. The average of benefits δB of the transfer models with source domains A, B, and C compared to the baseline strategy as calculated. The comparison between domain similarity indicators and benefits is illustrated in Fig. 9 . In Fig. 9, as the spectrum normalization difference decreases from source domain A to source domain C, the similarity between the source domain and the target domain decreases, resulting in a decline in the performance of the transfer models. As the spectrum normalization difference index decreases by 19.7%, the average percentage improvement in benefits of transfer reinforcement learning drops from 19.0% to 9.6%. The normalization difference index and operation benefits exhibit a similar trend. Therefore, the domain similarity testing method can help identify suitable source domains for transfer reinforcement learning. 4.2.2 Operation verification By using case building A as the source domain building for transfer imitation learning, the transferred model is applied to the target domain building. Fig. 10(a) shows the control schedules of transfer imitation learning. Fig. 10(b) shows the electrical load curves of transfer imitation learning strategy and baseline strategy. The color of the background area indicates time-of-use electricity pricing periods, with the intensity of the color deepening as electricity prices rise. The white area is the valley electricity price period from 23:00 to 7:00, 0.378RMB/kWh. The blue area is the peak tariff period, from 9:00 to 12:00, and from 16:00 to 21:00, at 1.115RMB/kWh. Other areas are flat price periods, 0.771RMB/kWh. From Fig. 10(a), the transfer imitation learning strategy raises the indoor temperature during high-priced electricity periods to reduce the load on the air conditioning system, thereby lowering operating costs and fulfilling grid demand response. The thermal storage tank is charged during the night and releases heat during morning and evening peak electricity price periods, thereby shifting the air conditioning load from high-priced to low-priced electricity periods. Throughout the operation, the indoor temperature variation remains within the comfortable range. According to Fig. 10(b), compared with the baseline strategy, the transfer imitation learning strategy transferred 551.8 kWh of electrical load from the peak price period to the low-price period, the operating cost is saved by 33.5%. Hence, employing transfer imitation learning in the target building can yield practical operational strategies. As transfer imitation learning leverages knowledge from the source domain to directly generate strategies based on the environmental condition, its efficacy remains unaffected by the quality of the load forecasting dataset. 4.3 Performance of the adaptive switching control model 4.3.1 Operation benefits The operation period for testing is from July 31st to August 29th, with the initial training of the XGBoost load forecasting model and transfer imitation learning model using data from July 1st to July 30th. During the operational days falling within the high completeness cluster, the model-based optimization is applied, whereas for those within the low completeness cluster, the transfer imitation learning method is employed. The relative improvement in operation benefits of the adaptive switching model is shown in Fig. 11 . The red line represents the information completeness judgment result of the data set used for load forecasting on the operating day. According to the judgment results, the control model is selected ahead of day. Correspondingly the green bars represent the switching of the control model to transfer imitation learning, resulting in improved operational effectiveness compared to the model-based optimization strategy, and the orange bars represent the switching of the control model to model-based optimization, resulting in improved operational effectiveness compared to the transfer imitation learning strategy. Operational days are arranged from high to low based on forecasting errors, with the dark gray area representing days with forecasting errors >30%, the light gray area representing days with forecasting errors between 13% and 30%, and the white area representing days with forecasting errors <13%. In Fig. 11, during days characterized by high forecasting errors, the air conditioning system control model primarily shifts towards employing the transfer imitation learning method to mitigate the impact of inaccurate forecasting on optimization scheduling outcomes. On these days, the adaptive switching model achieves a notable 21.1% reduction in operating costs and an 8.7% decrease in energy consumption, highlighting a substantial enhancement in operational effectiveness. During days characterized by low forecasting errors, the air conditioning system control model is mainly switched to the model-based optimization method, effectively utilizing constrained optimization based on the model and avoiding operational instability caused by the exploration process of reinforcement learning models. Compared to using the transfer imitation learning method, the adaptive model switching method results in a 13.2% reduction in operating costs and a 6.5% decrease in energy consumption. For days featuring forecasting errors between 13% and 30%, the operational effectiveness of both transfer imitation learning and model-based optimization methods appears comparable. In comparison to non-switching scenarios, the adaptive model switching method leads to decrease in energy consumption, amounting to 0.8% and 1.7% compared to transfer imitation learning and model-based optimization methods, respectively. In terms of total operating costs and energy consumption reduction percentages relative to the baseline strategy, the operation benefits of the adaptive switching method, the transfer imitation learning method and the model-based optimization method are shown in Fig. 12 . The results in Fig. 12 show that, during the test period, the adaptive switching method can save operating costs by 3.0% and 4.7% and reduce energy consumption by 2.0% and 2.8% compared to model-based optimization and transfer imitation learning methods without switching, respectively. This demonstrates that adaptive switching method can flexibly switch between model-based optimization and reinforcement learning methods based on the completeness of operational day information, leveraging the advantages of both methods in control. 4.3.2 Robustness To verify the robustness of the adaptive switching model, the scenario with uncertain inputs is considered. The operation days for testing are selected from July 31st to August 29th. Under the uncertain input scenarios, random errors following a normal distribution are introduced to the outdoor dry-bulb temperature and relative humidity of the prediction set to simulate the uncertainty caused by inaccurate weather forecasts. The dry-bulb temperature and relative humidity in the training set are the actual value. The relative improvement in operation benefits of the adaptive switching model is shown in Fig. 13 . Under uncertain input scenarios, the operational days with high forecasting errors increases. The adaptive switching model predominantly adopts the transfer imitation learning method for control on those days. Compared to solely relying on the model-based optimization method, the adaptive switching method can reduce operating costs by 15.2% and decrease energy consumption by 7.1%. Besides, during the days with low forecasting errors, the adaptive control model is predominantly switched to the model-based optimization method. Compared to using only the transfer imitation learning method, the adaptive model switching method reduces operating costs by 15.7% and decreases energy consumption by 12.5%. Compared to the baseline strategy, the operation benefits of the control models with adaptive switching method, transfer imitation learning method, and model-based optimization method are shown in Fig. 14 . In Fig. 14, compared to the operation performance of transfer imitation learning and model-based optimization methods without switching, the adaptive switching method can reduce operating costs by 3.0% and 5.5%, and decrease energy consumption by 2.3% and 5.0%, respectively. Although the uncertainty in outdoor dry-bulb temperature and relative humidity increases the forecasting errors, the adaptive model switching method exhibits good robustness by switching the control model to transfer imitation learning on those operational days. It demonstrates that transfer imitation learning method can better address the uncertainty in meteorological parameters than model-based optimization method. 5 Conclusion The matching mechanism between building HVAC control models and data information completeness is investigated in this study. By analyzing the differences in external disturbances, internal disturbances, and historical similar day information, an information completeness judgment method is proposed to pre-judge the quality of the dataset. The conventional DQN model undergoes enhancement through the introduction of transfer learning and source domain determination mechanisms, as well as the incorporation of imitation learning methods. The proposed adaptive switching model effectively combines reinforcement learning with model-based optimization methods and demonstrates better operation performance and robustness than single control models in practical case studies. The main conclusions of this paper include: (1) The information completeness judgment method can classify the quality of the dataset and distinguish between high and low forecasting error datasets. When using high completeness data for load forecasting and model-based optimization control, the relative improvement in operational benefits compared to the baseline strategy is 13.5% higher than that of low completeness data. (2) The transfer imitation learning model enhances the low completeness data for system control. Optimal selection of the source domain for transfer learning leads to a relative improvement in operational benefits, surpassing the baseline strategy by 11.5% compared to model-based optimization under conditions of low data completeness. (3) The proposed domain similarity test method effectively selects the optimal source domain. When different source domains are chosen for transfer learning, the enhancement in operational benefits of transfer reinforcement learning relative to the baseline strategy consistently varies with the trend of domain similarity indicators. (4) The adaptive switching model reduces operating costs by 3.0% and 4.7%, and decreases energy consumption by 2.0% and 2.8%, respectively, compared to the control models with model-based optimization and transfer imitation learning methods. Moreover, it demonstrates robustness, showing reductions in operating costs by 3.0% and 5.5%, and in energy consumption by 2.3% and 5.0%, respectively, compared to the single control models without switching, when facing scenarios with uncertain meteorological parameters.

Appendix A Appendix A.1 A Optimization problem description The model for the air-cooled chiller unit in this paper is selected from the DOE-2 model. This model uses nominal operating parameters and performance curves to determine the operating performance of the equipment under various conditions. The nominal operating parameters include nominal cooling capacity and nominal electrical power. The performance curves include the CapFTemp function, EIRTemp function, and EIRFPLR function. The energy of the thermal storage tank at time t + 1 is determined by adding or subtracting the energy stored or withdrawn at time t and subtracting the energy loss due to heat exchange with the surrounding environment. The calculation formulas are as follows: (A1) R t + 1 = R t + Δt · Q TES t + ϕ · T amb − T TES Q TES t ⩾ 0 (A2) R t + 1 = R t + Δt · Q TES t + ϕ · T amb − T TES Q TES t ⩽ 0 Here, Eq.

The first part represents the cost incurred by the electrical consumption of the equipment during the daytime forecasting window, and the second part represents the cost incurred by the release of energy from the thermal energy storage tank during the day, equivalent to the energy consumption of the chiller units during the nighttime. λ t and λ night represent the daytime time-of-use electricity price and the nighttime low electricity price, respectively, in RMB/kWh. Q TES , t represents the power of energy release from the thermal energy storage tank at time t in kW. ω hp , t is the energy consumption calculation coefficient, taking a value of 1 from 6 AM to 9 PM and 0 otherwise, and P hp , t represents the energy consumption of the equipment at time t. Eq. (A5) represents the optimization of energy consumption. The first part represents the electrical consumption of the equipment during the daytime forecasting window, and the second part represents the energy consumption incurred by the release of energy from the thermal energy storage tank during the day, equivalent to the energy consumption of the chiller units during the nighttime. During the optimization process, to ensure the safety and rationality of the operation, the following constraints are set: (A7) T in min ≤ T in ≤ T in max T in max and T in min represent the upper and lower limits of the indoor temperature, respectively. The upper and lower limits of the indoor temperature are set to 28.9 °C and 22.5 °C, respectively.

The optimization process is performed using particle swarm algorithm, implemented in Python. The computation is conducted on a computer with an Intel® Core™ i5-10210U CPU @ 1.60GHz 2.11 GHz and 16.0GB RAM. A.2 Markov decision process setting The parameter settings of the Markov decision process significantly impact the performance of reinforcement learning algorithms, including the selection of state variables, control actions, and reward functions. The parameter settings for agents A, B, and C are as follows: (1) Agent A. To reduce the dimensionality of the input state space and enhance training efficiency, it is necessary to select a subset of state variables. Due to the Markov property of reinforcement learning, agents primarily focus on the state information near the current time step. Therefore, the selected state variables are as follows: (B1) S t A = T in , t T out , t T out , t − 2 T out , t − 4 I t RH t E plug , t t λ t where, T in , t represents the indoor temperature at time t in Celsius, T out , t , T out , t − 2 , T out , t − 4 represent the outdoor dry bulb temperature at time t, t-2, and t-4 in Celsius respectively, I t represents the solar radiation intensity at time t in W/m2, RH t represents the outdoor relative humidity in percentage, E plug , t represents the power consumption of indoor socket in kw, λ t represents the electricity price at the current time step in RMB/kWh. For agent A, the output action is the resetting of the indoor temperature setpoint. Considering the thermal comfort range, the temperature resetting range is set to 23 ° C 28.5 ° C , with temperature adjustments made in 0.5 °C increments to account for the limitations of the indoor temperature controller. Therefore, the action space for agent A is set as follows: (B2) A t A = 23 ° C 23.5 ° C \u2026 28.5 ° C The objective of agent A's scheduling control is to reduce the operating cost of the HVAC system by adjusting the indoor temperature while ensuring that it remains within the comfort range. Hence, the reward function for agent A is defined as follows: (B3) r t A = − β 1 A ⋅ λ t ⋅ Q AHU , t EIR ref ⋅ Δ t − β 2 A ⋅ ω comfort , t ⋅ c t comfort − θ t A ⋅ penalty where Q AHU , t represents the load of the air handling unit (AHU) in kW, EIR ref represents the efficiency of the chiller unit under nominal conditions, ω comfort , t and c t comfort represent the temperature calculation coefficient and the function related to indoor comfort, respectively, calculated according to eq A6, β 1 A and β 2 A are weighting coefficients, θ t A is the penalty coefficient for violating comfort, as shown in eq. (B4), and penalty represents the penalty term, taking a large value when comfort is violated. (B4) 1 T in < T in min or T in max < T in 0 else (2) Agent B Agent B controls the discharging energy of the thermal energy storage (TES) tank and needs to perceive the building cooling load and its variation trend. Therefore, the state variables should include indoor and outdoor parameters. Additionally, one of the objectives of the joint operation of the chiller unit and the TES tank is to save operating costs. Hence, the state variables should further include time-of-use electricity prices and time parameters. Finally, to perceive the state of the TES tank, the state variables should include some parameters related to the operation of the HVAC system. The state variables for agent B are as follows: (B5) S t B = T in , set , t T in , t T out , t T out , t − 2 T out , t − 4 I t RH t E plug , t T TES , t t λ t Where T in , set , t represents the indoor temperature setpoint at time t in Celsius, and T TES , t represents the average temperature of the TES tank at time t in Celsius. For agent B, the output action is to schedule the discharging energy of the TES tank at time t, controlled according to the percentage of the AHU load at time t. The range of discharging energy relative to the AHU load percentage is from 0 100 % , with a step size of 10%. The action space for agent B is set as follows: (B6) A t B = 0 0.1 \u2026 1 The objective of agent B's scheduling is to transfer the electricity load from peak price periods to off-peak periods at night, thereby reducing the operating costs of the HVAC system. At the same time, it is necessary to ensure that the indoor cooling load demand is met, i.e., the indoor temperature remains within the comfort range. The reward function for agent B is set as follows: (B7) r t B = − β 1 B ⋅ λ t ⋅ P t B + Q TES , t Q ref ⋅ P ref ⋅ λ night ⋅ Δ t − β 2 B ⋅ ω comfort , t ⋅ c t comfort − θ t B ⋅ penalty where β 1 B and β 2 B are weighting coefficients, θ t B is the penalty coefficient for agent B violating constraints, calculated as in eq. (B8), and P t B represents the energy consumption of the unit under non-optimized outlet water temperature, calculated as in eq. (B9). (B8) 1 T in < T in min or T in max < T in 1 Q hp , t < 0.3 · Q avi , t or Q avi , t < Q hp , t 1 13 < T TES , t 0 else (B9) P t B = P ref ⋅ CapFTemp ref ⋅ EIRFTemp ref ⋅ EIRFPLR t In the equations, Q avi , t represents the available cooling capacity at time t under outdoor conditions, Q hp , t represents the load of the air-cooled chiller unit at time t, CapFTemp ref and EIRFTemp ref represent the values of the functions at the standard operating condition, and EIRFPLR t is the value of EIRFPLR at time t, related to the chiller load. (3) Agent C For agent C, the control involves setting the chilled water supply temperature of the air-cooled chiller unit. It needs to perceive the building and unit load requirements, so the state variables should include indoor and outdoor parameters as well as the TES tank discharging energy setpoint. Since the objective is to reduce the energy consumption of the HVAC system, the time of operation and time-of-use electricity prices are not included in the state variables. The state variables for agent C are as follows: (B10) S t C = T in , set , t T in , t T out , t I t RH t E plug , t T TES , t Q TES , t T chw , S , t T chw , R , t M sys , t where T chw , S , t and T chw , R , t represent the system supply and return water temperatures at time t in Celsius, respectively, and M sys , t represents the system flow rate at time t in m 3 / h . For agent C, the output action is the chilled water supply temperature setpoint at time t. To meet the cooling and dehumidification requirements and considering equipment performance, the setpoint range for the chilled water supply temperature is from 5 ° C 10 ° C , with a step size of 0.5 °C. The action space for agent C is set as follows: (B11) A t C = 5 ° C 5.5 ° C \u2026 10 ° C The objective of agent C control is to optimize the energy consumption of the chiller unit by changing the chilled water supply temperature setpoint based on the current indoor temperature setpoint and TES tank discharging energy setpoint. The reward function for agent C is set as follows: (B12) r t C = − P hp , t ⋅ Δ t − θ t C ⋅ penalty Where P hp , t represents the measured power of the unit at time t in kW, and θ t C is the penalty coefficient for agent C violating constraints, calculated as in the eq. (B13). (B13) 1 13 < T TES , t 1 10 < T chw , S , t or 16 < T chw , R , t 1 120 < M sys , t 0 else In this study, the imitation learning loss function is introduced to adjust the indoor temperature setting and energy release from the water tank, as shown in eqs. (B14) and (B15): (B14) A t A − A t , max A 2 λ t = λ max 0 else (B15) A t B − A t , min B 2 λ t = λ min , A t B > 0 A t B − A t , max B 2 λ t = λ max , A t B = 0 0 else In the equations, f A ⋅ and f B ⋅ represent the imitation learning loss functions for the agent A and the agent B respectively. A t A and A t B denote their action spaces. A t , max A represents the maximum action values for agent A, while A t , min B and A t , max B represent the minimum and maximum action values for agent B. λ min and λ max represent the minimum and maximum values of time-of-use electricity prices. Eq. (B14) indicates that during peak electricity price periods, the air conditioning system needs to reduce its load to lower operating costs and meet demand response. During these periods, the air conditioning set temperature should be set to a higher value. Eq. (B15) indicates that during off-peak electricity price periods, it is necessary to reduce the energy release from the storage water tank or not use the storage water tank; during peak electricity price periods, the storage water tank should be activated to achieve load shifting. The implementation of the DQN algorithm is facilitated using the Python language, with the neural network for the agent built and trained using the PyTorch library. References [1] Z. Dalala M.

        "dc:description": "As building energy management systems are widely applied, a large amount of operational data can be acquired and utilized for building load forecasting and energy system control. However, there's a lack of methods for assessing the completeness of operational data sets and the requisite data quality for various control models. Without these assessments, addressing the loss of model accuracy due to fluctuations in data quality becomes challenging, resulting in deviations from actual operating conditions and decreased control performance. To bridge the gaps, a clustering method is employed to categorize load forecasting training dataset into high and low completeness categories. By matching a reinforcement learning control model combining transfer learning and imitation learning to low completeness datasets and a model-based optimization control model to high completeness datasets, an adaptive switching control model is proposed for air conditioning systems in this study. Case study demonstrates that employing transfer imitation learning results in an 11.5% higher operation benefit compared to model-based optimization under low completeness data conditions. The adaptive switching control model can further reduce operational costs by 5.5% and energy consumption by 5.0% compared to the single control models using only model-based optimization or transfer imitation learning.",
