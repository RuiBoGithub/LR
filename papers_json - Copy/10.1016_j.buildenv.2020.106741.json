Public buildings have large indoor personnel flow changes and complex backgrounds. Due to the large lag of air-conditioning systems, such systems in public buildings have difficulty adjusting to changes in indoor loads, resulting in untimely system control, poor thermal control of buildings' internal environments, and energy waste. This paper proposes a real-time estimation method of building space personnel load and an air-conditioning predictive control strategy by integrating image information. First, deep learning image detection technology is applied to establish an end-to-end building space personnel load dynamic estimation model based on a convolutional neural network. The model is employed to realize the real-time detection of the number of indoor personnel and estimate changes personnel load. Second, to propose air-conditioning prediction control strategies introduce personnel occupancy load control factors, predict the indoor temperature change trend caused by load changes, provide compensation for the control system adjustment amount, improve the indoor environment quality problems caused by large lag under conventional control methods, adjust the cooling energy supply of air conditioning systems, and reduce energy consumption. Finally, the simulation experiment involving a student activity center and a small office building is carried out and the results are analyzed. Simulation results show that: the predictive control strategy proposed in this paper can better maintain environmental stability in a building, can respond more rapidly and has greater energy-saving potential. Keywords Load estimation Image information Air conditioning energy consumption Predictive control 1 Introduction Building energy consumption accounts for 40% of global energy consumption, of which air conditioning (HVAC) system energy consumption accounts for a large proportion. In China, the energy consumption of air-conditioning system operation accounts for approximately 40% of public-building energy consumption and is the main reason for the high energy consumption of public buildings [1,2]. Therefore, researching effective air-conditioning control strategies and reducing the operating energy consumption of air-conditioning systems on the premise of satisfying comfort has important theoretical research and practical application value for energy conservation, emission reduction and sustainable development of the national economy. In a building, due to the influences of the building's thermal inertia, indoor thermal mass diffusion, and the heat transmission and distribution efficiency of the air conditioning system itself, the air conditioning system has large lag. The room temperature response lags behind the adjustment actions of the air conditioning system (such as changing the air volume, air temperature, and valve opening), and the system's adjustments follow the changes of indoor loads (such as changes in the number of indoor personnel occupancy and movement status). The large lags cause poor system regulation, poor comfort, and low energy efficiency [3,4]. In recent years, many scholars have researched the problem of large lags in air conditioning process control, with proposed solutions falling mainly into two categories: predictive control methods based on accurate mathematical models and predictive control methods based on data-driven. Predictive control methods based on accurate mathematical models mainly include Smith predictive compensation [5,6] and generalized predictive control [7,8]. The Smith prediction compensation strategy is adopted to provide pure lag compensation to the PID controller to improve the stability and dynamic performance of the system and solve the large lag problem of dynamic adjustment of the air-conditioning system. Generalized predictive control uses input and output time series to achieve predictive control, through rolling optimization and feedback correction achieves predictive control. However, the performance of predictive control methods depends heavily on the accuracy of the model. With the rapid development of information technology, the data-driven Model Predictive Control (MPC) has established an excellent model structure for air-conditioning control systems by analyzing the strong non-linear characteristics implicit in the data [9], and become the main method for predicting control problems of large lags in domestic air conditioning [10,11]. [12]proposed a hybrid neural network-fuzzy decoupling controller to predict room temperature based on an autoregressive neural network model [13]; using the model characteristics of the NARX network, Establishing a discrete-time series equation for multiple input and multiple output of air-conditioning system, proposed a model identification method of a multizone air-conditioning system based on a neural network [14]; According to the basic principle of periodical predictive control for time-delay systems, an Elman network layer optimal selection algorithm for determining the lag time of room temperature to the system adjustment amount is proposed. A multi-step predictive model of a room temperature time-delay system based on an Elman network and a response indoor temperature predictive control method are established. The research presented in the present paper describes the large-temperature lag response characteristics of room temperature according to the system's input, output, and adjustments and can better identify the lag characteristics of room-temperature dynamic response to the air-conditioning system's adjustment action, predict the state quantities in the time domain, and then achieve correction of the control system adjustments. A better control effect is achieved with less disturbance. However, in actual application, an air-conditioning system is subject to great interference from internal and external heat sources, especially the randomness and uncertainty of the flow of people in public buildings, which causes large changes in the dynamic load of indoor personnel. Due to the influence of factors such as indoor thermal mass diffusion, existing control strategies cannot timely predict the response to indoor temperature changes caused by the dynamic load of personnel occupancy, resulting in a lag in the response of the system adjustment action, a large delay, and poor thermal comfort in the building's internal environment. Furthermore, energy is wasted. Therefore, accurately estimating the dynamic personnel occupancy load, predicting the change in room temperature, adjusting the air-conditioning action in a timely manner, improving the large lag of the system, and realizing supply and demand matching are practical problems that need to be solved. The accurate estimation of personnel occupancy load disturbance is a prerequisite for solving the above problems [15\u201318]. Using machine learning, neural networks, and other algorithms to estimate long-term, short-term, and ultra-short-term personnel load based on historical data but failed to reflect the true situation [19\u201322]. The CO2 concentration level is used to estimate the real-time occupancy of the internal personnel of the building, but the CO2 dilution process, the source of CO2 inside the building, and the building ventilation status affect the accuracy of test results [23\u201325]. The personnel occupancy load can be predicted by detecting the number of Wi-Fi network signals that people access indoors, but these signals are often subject to interference from the building's geometry and other signals, causing network instability or delay. In addition, the incoming quantity detection of Wi-Fi connections is not accurate. Furthermore, the privacy issues presented by this method have become key contributors to the failure of this method [26\u201328]. The application of video information in the detection of personnel occupancy load in buildings has also been discussed. However, most video detection methods use traditional methods such as HOG-SVM, which have low detection accuracy and require the preprocessing of video information [29]. Proposed the use of a combination of CO2 concentration and video information to detect a load of personnel occupancy in small space buildings to control the start and stop of individual air conditioners. The above-described methods have not achieved ideal results for the real-time detection of personnel occupancy in complex scenarios. In recent years, deep learning models represented by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which can acquire deep features, have developed rapidly in the areas of semantic segmentation, target detection and recognition [30\u201332]. Some scholars have applied them to the field of crowd counting in complex scenes and achieved good results [33\u201335]. This provides a new method for the real-time estimation of building space personnel occupancy load and a prerequisite and foundation for the realization of predictive control method of air conditioning systems based on personnel occupancy load estimation. The large changes in personnel flow and complex backgrounds in public buildings make it difficult for an air conditioning control system to adjust to changes in the indoor load. This paper proposes a method for the real-time estimation of building space personnel occupancy load and a predictive control strategy of air conditioning by fusing image information. Computer vision and deep learning detection technology are applied to establish an end-to-end building space staff load dynamic estimation model based on a convolutional neural network to realize the real-time detection of the number of indoor personnel and estimate the dynamic change of staff load. In addition, a method for air-conditioning forecasting is proposed, introducing personnel load control factors, predicting the indoor temperature change trend caused by personnel occupancy load changes, providing compensation for control system adjustments, improving indoor environmental quality problems caused by large hysteresis under conventional control methods, and adjusting the cooling supply of air conditioning systems, energy saving. At the end of the paper, with the example of an activity center and an office building, the feasibility and effectiveness of air-conditioning predictive control strategies are discussed based on real-time personnel occupancy load changes. 2 Methodology 2.1 A dynamic load estimation model of building space personnel occupancy based on a convolutional neural network The real-time detection of people inside a building is a prerequisite for dynamic regulation of the operation of air-conditioning systems based on real-time load estimation. In recent years, images have become an important means for human detection due to due to their ability to provide rapid, direct measures of detection. In complex background images of shopping malls, stadiums, airports, and other public buildings, crowd densities are high, and occlusion and light changes are common. Traditional methods using local or global features of a single scene image have limitations in solving crowd scenes under complex backgrounds. The problem and deep CNN can express complex prior knowledge of images, an advantage for model expression. In this paper, deep learning is used to build an end-to-end person (head) fast and accurate head detector (FCHD) model [36] and count the number of people (heads) detected to obtain the real-time number of people inside the building, the real-time indoor personnel occupancy load is calculated. The structure of the FCHD personnel (head) detection model is shown in Fig. 1 . The FCHD model combines the advantages of the head detection method and crowd counting method [37]. First, uses the VGG16 pretrained model as the model basis [38,39]and 5 convolutional layers to extract features from the scene image to obtain high-dimensional features with a dimension of (40 × 30 × 512) dimensions. Then, two convolutional layers are then used to predict the head positioning coordinate information and the predicted head probability score information. Finally, uses multiple loss fusion (classification loss and regression loss) to calculate the final head frame output area, gets head border map. When the loss function L is greater than the set threshold (0.70 in this paper), the frame is considered as a person. If L is less than the set threshold, it is interpreted as indicating that there is no one there. The loss function L considers both classification loss and regression loss, which can solve the problem of occluded scenes and high sensitivity of image resolution. The loss function is shown in Formula 1, the classification loss L c l s is shown in Formula 2, and the regression loss L r e g is shown in Formula 3. (1) L ( { p i } , { t i } ) = 1 N c l s ∑ i L c l s ( p i , p i * ) + 1 N r e g ∑ i p i * L r e g ( t i , t i * ) (2) L c l s ( p i , p i * ) = − log [ p i p i * + ( 1 − p i ) ( 1 − p i * ) ] (3) L r e g ( t i , t i * ) = R ( t i − t i * ) where, R is s m o o t h L 1 function, and its form is shown in Equation (4). (4) s m o o t h L 1 ( x ) = { 0.5 x 2 i f | x | < 1 | x | − 0.5 o t h e r w i s e where, p i is the predicted probability of the head contained in the candidate frame i , p i * is the truth value label; t i is the parameterized coordinates (i.e., scale and displacement) of the predicted bounding box, and t i * is the parameterized coordinates of the true value. N c l s is the total number of anchors, and N r e g is the size of the feature map. The FCHD personnel (head) model detection process is shown in Fig. 2 , the red box is the model detection result. First, the model parameters are estimated by performing network training on the sample images with human head labels; then, the trained parameters are applied to the detection model; Finally, the space image of the building to be detected is input to obtain the detection result with the head frame. Through the model to detect personnel, count the number of red boxes to obtain the current number of people N ( t ) , and the real-time personnel occupancy load can be calculated by the Formula 5. (5) Q ( t ) = k ⋅ N ( t ) ⋅ q where, Q ( t ) is the human load in the building space at time t, k is the clustering coefficient, N ( t ) is the total number of people in the room at time t, and q is the human load index in W / person [40]. The real-time personnel occupancy load estimation method using the FCHD model solves the problems of lag and complexity of traditional load calculations. It can more accurately and conveniently obtain the load changes caused by personnel changes in the current building and provide further energy supply and demand control for air conditioning systems. The load calculation is accurate and real-time. 2.2 Air-conditioning predictive control strategy based on building space personnel occupancy load estimation The conventional air-conditioning control system is usually a double closed-loop cascade control, including an outer-loop temperature control module and an inner-loop cooling capacity control module, as shown in the dashed box in Fig. 3 . The outer ring control module outputs the required cooling capacity of the system according to the difference between the current building space detection temperature and the set temperature; the inner ring cooling control section adjusts the air valve/water valve size to achieve the regulation of the cooling energy and maintains the indoor temperature within the set range. However, a public building space has large indoor personnel flow changes and complex backgrounds. The thermal inertia of buildings, indoor thermal mass diffusion, and other factors limit the ability of traditional temperature, humidity and CO2 sensors to detect changes in room temperature caused by changes in personnel occupancy load. The time lag makes it difficult for the air conditioning control system of public buildings to adjust to the changes in indoor load (such as changes in the number of indoor personnel and movement status). As a result, the system's cold supply is inappropriate, the building's thermal environment is not comfortable, and energy is wasted. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a predictive control strategy for air conditioning based on the dynamic estimation of the personnel occupancy load. The formula (6) is used to introduce personnel occupancy load control factors, calculate the load change △ Q . The formula (7) predict the indoor temperature change trend caused by personnel occupancy load changes and calculate cooling compensation △ G , and according to formula (8), calculate the actual cooling value G of the inner-loop cooling energy control module, achieve the purpose of quickly following the dynamic change of the indoor load, and improve the quality of the thermal environment control. The control principle is shown in Fig. 3. The dashed box is a conventional control strategy. (6) Δ Q = Q ( t ) − Q ( t − 1 ) = k × Δ N × q (7) Δ G = Δ Q N m a x × G 0 (8) G = G 0 + Δ G = ( 1 + Δ Q N m a x ) G 0 where, N m a x is the maximum personnel occupation load inside the building, and G 0 is the cooling supply of the system's original control strategy. The implementation process of the control strategy is shown in Fig. 4 . The steps of the process are as follows: First, set the optimal temperature of the air-conditioning system, and turn on the air-conditioning system. Then, collect the indoor scene image information through the camera; then, use the FCHD model to obtain the real-time number of people in the room N ( t ) . Next, obtain the system cooling value G0 of the conventional control strategy output from the outer loop control module; then, calculate the load change △ Q according to formula (6), and predict the cooling compensation △ G according to formula (7). Finally, determine the current required cooling energy G of the air conditioning system according to formula (8). The opening size of the air valve/water valve is accordingly controlled to maintain the internal ambient temperature of the building. To avoid adjusting the system too frequently, scene image collection is set in this article to be performed every 10 min. Compared with conventional air-conditioning control methods, the method in this paper uses building space image information to achieve accurate estimation of real-time changes in the load of personal occupancy inside buildings. Furthermore, it predicts cold compensation based on real-time changes in load. It represents an improvement over conventional control methods that suffer from large lag and indoor environmental quality problems, regulating the cooling supply of air conditioning systems, and reducing consumption. 3 Simulation design 3.1 Co-simulation Due to the experimental site conditions and the long-time required to obtain information from the actual environment, at the same time, in order to effectively compare different control strategies, the experiment should ensure that it is not affected by factors such as the envelope structure and outdoor temperature changes. Therefore, this paper uses simulation to complete the verification and analysis of the algorithm. SketchUp is used to construct a simulation building, and TRNSYS is used as the simulation platform for the air-conditioning system; the personnel occupancy load estimation and strategy is implemented by MATLAB [41]. The co-simulation process in this paper is shown in Fig. 5 . 3.2 Simulation model building To verify the effectiveness of this method for different building types, a activity center in Xi'an and a small office in Xi'an was established. The building simulation model of the activity center is shown in Fig. 6 (a), the building simulation model of the small office is shown in Fig. 6(b). In addition, the specific building parameter settings of the two buildings are shown in Table 1 , and the specific equipment deployment inside the building is shown in Fig. 7 . 4 Simulation results and discussion 4.1 FCHD personnel (head) detection model and results Public buildings have diverse functions and complex scenes, and their detection images have complex and changeable backgrounds, light levels, and occlusions. This paper uses the BRAINWASH dataset, Wanda mall dataset, and Qinghai showroom data set to verify the performance of the FCHD personnel detection model. Set image types represent most of the problems with complex background images. The results of the personnel detection are shown in Fig. 8 . The red box is the detected personnel. The image of the BRAINWASH dataset in Fig. 8 (a) is mainly from the cafe scene, which contains 11,917 images, of which 484 are used for testing. The image of the Wanda mall dataset in Fig. 8 (b) is from the large mall scene, which contains 1,200 images, of which 300 are used as test images. The image of the Qinghai exhibition hall dataset in Fig. 8 (c) is derived from the exhibition hall scene and contains 2,000 pictures, of which 200 are used for testing. The test results of three different scene datasets show that the person (head) detection method proposed in this paper can effectively identify image head features and personnel for different scenes, periods, personnel sizes, angles, and lighting conditions. The detection effect is better. Table 2 shows the average performance of the model on all data sets. The average accuracy of the model was approximately 0.7 for conditions of severe occlusion and dim light. Compared with traditional detection methods, the model has great advantages in detection accuracy in complex scenes. Furthermore, the FCHD model has a small size and a fast model inference speed and is thus suitable for running on embedded devices, which also suggesting the promise of the method for widespread application. 4.2 Control strategy simulation analysis To analyze the effectiveness of the control strategy and the impacts of changes in personnel occupancy load in this paper, this section conducts simulation analysis of public buildings of activity centers and small offices from both qualitative and quantitative perspective. 4.2.1 Qualitative analysis of simulation results for the activity center building In the simulation process, it is assumed that the activity center is used between 06:00 and 19:00, so the air-conditioning system is set to turn on at 06:00 and turn off at 19:00. Personnel occupancy changes are shown in Fig. 9 (a). The 7.21 system operating conditions are selected for qualitative analysis. The changes in temperature and cooling energy of the air conditioning system are shown in Fig. 9 (b) and (c). During T1 (07:00\u201308:30), the number of personnel gradually increases. The control strategy in this paper can quickly adjust the cooling energy of the system according to the current cooling load change, improve the adjustment delay phenomenon in the conventional control strategy, and control the indoor temperature more smoothly. During the T2 (10:00\u201313:00), the number of people gradually decreases. Because the control strategy in this paper can predict the trend of indoor temperature caused by personnel occupancy load changes, on the premise of ensuring stable temperature, it can reduce amount of cooling required of the system and save energy. During T3 (13:00\u201313:30), the building space personnel occupancy is always zero. The cooling value required by the method in this paper is much lower than the conventional control strategy. Although the temperature inside the building is higher than the set value, there is no movement of people inside the building, and the environment in the building can be relaxed. due to the large hysteresis of the air conditioning system, conventional control strategies cannot follow the changes in load in a timely manner, resulting in the internal temperature of the building is lower than the set value and excessive cooling supply, which wastes energy. During the T4 (13:30\u201315:30), the personnel gradually increased again, the load continued to rise, and the system response lag amount continued to accumulate, resulting in conventional control strategies that consume a lot of energy while the room temperature cannot be maintained well. Around 26 °C; the control strategy in this paper can not only make the indoor temperature quickly stabilized at 26 °C, but also reduce the consumption of cooling capacity, and achieve energy conservation while maintaining a good building environment. Through the above process, it can be seen that: using the conventional air conditioning control strategy, the indoor temperature variation fluctuates greatly; using this control strategy, the indoor temperature variation fluctuates less. When there are significant changes in building space personnel, the adjustment action of the conventional air conditioning control method cannot quickly reflect the load change, there is a large lag in the cooling output; the control strategy in this paper can quickly adjust the system cooling value according to the current environmental load demand, effectively improve the adjustment delay in the conventional control, so that the internal temperature of the building remains stable. Furtherly, under the same experimental conditions, different changes in the number of personnel are set. By observing the changes in the internal temperature of the building and the changes in the cooling energy of the system, the impact of personnel occupancy load changes on the predictive control effect in this paper is analyzed. Set the change of personnel inside the building to +20, +40, +60, +80. The experimental results are shown in Fig. 10 . It can be seen that the response of the conventional control strategy to the changes in building space load lags significantly. The greater the change in the number of people in the building space, the greater the increase in the space load in the building. the internal temperature above the set temperature for a long time, the thermal comfort is poor. The predictive control strategy in this paper can predict the response to changes in room temperature caused by load changes. According to the increase in the amount of load in the building space, the cooling energy required is compensated as needed, so that the indoor temperature can be quickly reduced to the set temperature, which better maintains the building environment quality. Set the change of personnel inside the building to −20, −40, −60, −80. The experimental results are shown in Fig. 11 . It can be seen that with conventional control strategies, due to the large lag characteristics of the air-conditioning system, the system continues to supply high cooling value, the indoor temperature is significantly lower than the set temperature, and the energy consumption is large; the greater the change in the number of building space personnel, the large the reduction in building space load, the more excess cooling energy provided by the conventional control system, and the larger the indoor temperature is below the set temperature. The predictive control strategy in this paper can quickly sense the reduction of personnel occupancy load, make the system respond quickly, realize the rapid adjustment of cooling supply, and save energy while maintaining room temperature stability. 4.2.2 Quantitative analysis of personnel occupancy load changes in activity centers building Based on the qualitative analysis, this section analyzes the impact of the change in personnel load on the control strategy in this paper. Table 3 shows the envelope structure load (including ventilation load) Q S , Miscellaneous loads Q M , lighting load Q L , personnel occupancy load change Q P / S , and personnel load change ratio δ . Among them, the calculation method of the personnel occupancy load change Q P / S is shown in formula (9), which reflects the increase/decrease of the number of personnel; the calculation method of the personnel load change ratio δ is shown in formula (10), which reflects the sensitivity of the current building type (basic load) to the increase/decrease in the number of people. It can be seen that the greater the increase/decrease in the number of personnel, the greater the change in personnel occupancy load. For the activity center building simulated in this paper, when the proportion of personnel load change ratio δ < 2.54 % , the predicted control effect in this paper is the same as the conventional control. Different buildings have different effective thresholds. (9) Q P / S = Q p S (10) δ = Q P / S Q S + Q L + Q M × 100 % 4.2.3 Quantitative analysis of cooling energy in activity centers building Using the personnel change curve shown in Fig. 9 (a), this article carried out 7.21\u20137.23 weather day simulations on the air-conditioning system of the building. The cooling energy results are shown in Fig. 12 and Table 4 . As can be seen from the chart: compared with the conventional control method, the control strategy in this paper requires less cooling; at the same time, the control strategy in this paper is more sensitive to dense crowds and has better energy-saving potential. When the max indoor personnel is 800 and 1000, the energy-saving effect is 3.84% and 6.70%, respectively. 4.2.4 The small office building simulation analysis In the simulation process, it is assumed that the small office is used between 07:00 and 17:00, so the air-conditioning system is set to turn on at 07:00 and turn off at 17:00. Table 5 shows the envelope structure load (including ventilation load) Q S , Miscellaneous loads Q M , lighting load Q L , personnel occupancy load change Q P / S , and personnel load change ratio δ . Among them, the calculation method of the personnel occupancy load change Q P / S is shown in formula (9), the calculation method of the personnel load change ratio δ is shown in formula (10). It can be seen from Table 6 that the amount of change in personnel = 2, the ratio δ = 4.03 % is the effective threshold of the control strategy for this building in this paper. Using the personnel change curve shown in Fig. 13 (a), this paper carried out 7.21, 7.24, 7.29, 8.1 and 8.3 weather day simulations on small office building air conditioning systems. The operation condition of the 7.21 weather day air conditioning system of the small office building is shown in Fig. 13 (b), 13 (c); the results of power consumption (including lighting equipment) are shown in Fig. 14 and Table 6. As can be seen from the figure and chart: In this control strategy, the effect of indoor temperature control is better; the larger the amount of personnel occupancy changes, the more obvious the effect; at the same time, the strategy in this paper consumes slightly less power and still has a slight energy saving potential. 5 Conclusion This paper proposes a method for the real-time estimation of building space personnel occupancy load and an air-conditioning predictive control strategy, which has certain value for improving the air quality of public buildings, reducing building energy consumption, and promoting the combination and application of control technology and artificial intelligence technology with the HVAC industry. In the method, image information of the interior of the building is collected with a camera, and computer vision and deep learning detection technology are applied. Then, an end-to-end building space staff load dynamic estimation model based on convolutional neural networks is established to realize the real-time estimation of personnel occupancy load changes. In this paper, an air-conditioning forecasting control strategy is proposed to introduce personnel occupancy load control factor, predicting the indoor temperature change trend caused by load changes, compensating for the adjustment amount of conventional air-conditioning control systems, improving the environmental quality problems in buildings caused by the hysteresis characteristics of conventional control methods, adjusting the cooling supply of the system, and realizing energy saving and consumption reduction. This article verifies the feasibility and effectiveness of the strategy through simulation experiments. The results show that: (1) The FCHD personnel occupancy load estimation method used in this paper has higher accuracy, which improves the traditional method which is difficult to accurately estimate the real-time load; (2) this paper proposes an air-conditioning predictive control strategy based on real-time personnel occupancy load changes, the adjustment amount of control system can be compensated by load change estimation, which improves the building environment quality, reduces energy consumption, and the energy-saving effect can reach 6.70%; (3) The change in personnel occupancy load has a greater impact on the control strategy in this paper, and the larger the change in personnel occupancy load, the more obvious the predictive control effect of this paper; (4) The change of personnel occupancy load is less than a certain range, and the effect of strategic control in this paper is equal to that of the conventional method. Different buildings have different ranges, which is the limitation of this paper.

Due to the large lag of air-conditioning systems, such systems in public buildings have difficulty adjusting to changes in indoor loads, resulting in untimely system control, poor thermal control of buildings' internal environments, and energy waste. This paper proposes a real-time estimation method of building space personnel load and an air-conditioning predictive control strategy by integrating image information. First, deep learning image detection technology is applied to establish an end-to-end building space personnel load dynamic estimation model based on a convolutional neural network. The model is employed to realize the real-time detection of the number of indoor personnel and estimate changes personnel load. Second, to propose air-conditioning prediction control strategies introduce personnel occupancy load control factors, predict the indoor temperature change trend caused by load changes, provide compensation for the control system adjustment amount, improve the indoor environment quality problems caused by large lag under conventional control methods, adjust the cooling energy supply of air conditioning systems, and reduce energy consumption. Finally, the simulation experiment involving a student activity center and a small office building is carried out and the results are analyzed. Simulation results show that: the predictive control strategy proposed in this paper can better maintain environmental stability in a building, can respond more rapidly and has greater energy-saving potential.",
