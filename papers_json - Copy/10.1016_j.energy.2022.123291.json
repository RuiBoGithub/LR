Quantification of demand flexibility is of key importance to decision makers at the planning level, when designing demand response programs and determining capacity requirements for new battery storage installations, and, at the operation level, when assessing the demand-side potential for providing grid services. While different frameworks have been proposed for demand flexibility quantification, the literature still lacks a framework that considers uncertainty sources, affecting building energy control problems, when directly quantifying the demand flexibility potential. We propose a novel framework based on stochastic model predictive control for direct demand flexibility quantification in a bottom-up manner that can account for uncertainty. The proposed framework is utilized to quantify the flexibility potential of a building under uncertainty arising from weather forecasts and the available reduced-order model. The results are compared with those obtained using an existing deterministic approach. We demonstrate that the deterministic approach tends to overestimate the flexibility potential on account of ignoring uncertainty, and the occupants\u2019 thermal comfort may be jeopardized if the grid asks for the flexibility estimated with the deterministic approach. The study accentuates the importance of developing an accurate model for model-based demand flexibility quantification owing to the significant effect of the modeling uncertainty. Keywords Renewable energy integration Grid-interactive efficient buildings Demand response Demand side management Control under uncertainty 1 Introduction Renewable energy has experienced rapid growth worldwide. For example, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), solar and wind energy accounted for 42% and 41% of the new electricity generation capacity in 2020, respectively. With the adoption of more renewable energy sources, the power grid faces new challenges such as load variations, intermittent energy supply, price volatility, and new peak/valley hours. In particular, the mismatch of renewable energy resources and electricity demand can lead to lower revenues and higher risks of curtailment, potentially hindering further growth in the renewable energy sector. Demand Flexibility (DF, interchangeably known as energy flexibility or load flexibility), defined by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) as the capability of distributed energy resources to adjust a building's load profile across different timescales [1], can potentially play a critical role in addressing those challenges. Similarly, the International Energy Agency (IEA) EBC Annex 67 defines energy flexibility in buildings as \u201c\u2026 the ability to manage its demand and generation according to local climate conditions, user needs, and energy network requirements\u201d [2]. For instance, DF can enable the shift of electricity consumption from times of the day with high demand but low renewable supply to times with higher renewable supply, which reduces customer costs [37], curtailment of renewable energy, peak demand [38], and carbon emissions compared to relying on flexible, fossil-fueled generation. Energy can be stored in storage media and released when necessary, decoupling the demand for electrical and thermal power in time. In fact, the availability of energy storage is of the utmost importance for DF provision. Different energy storage media are available including but not limited to battery storage, thermal energy storage (TES), latent storage (phase change materials (PCMs) and ice), and thermochemical storage [3]. For building energy systems, the building envelope (passive TES) [4] and water storage tanks (active TES) [5] are widely available and can be leveraged for demand flexibility provision. In accordance with the need for DF, flexibility events are typically classified into forced (upward, or increasing energy consumption) and delayed (downward, or decreasing energy consumption) modulations during a specific time span, referred to as the flexibility interval. Furthermore, in the context of grid-interactive efficient buildings, flexibility can be quantified from different perspectives, namely temporal flexibility, power flexibility, and energy flexibility [6]. Detailed characterization of demand flexibility is critical to harnessing its potential at both the planning and operation levels. At the planning level, accurate characterization of DF can assist with selecting a set of buildings to include in a Demand Response (DR) program. At the operation level, having an accurate characterization of DF helps when coming up with energy supply plans. In fact, DF characterization is beneficial to the grid operator allowing for better evaluation and comparison of the available resources on the supply and demand sides for ancillary services provision so that the required services are provided at the lowest possible cost. The demand side of the power system can be regarded as a large, readily available energy storage that can be tapped whenever necessary. Unlike batteries whose parameters are constant over time, the parameters of the demand-side storage can be highly time-dependent and volatile [7]. Quantification of demand flexibility is important to estimate the available storage potential on the demand side under different conditions, especially under extreme conditions caused by severely inclement weather. Knowing the available storage capacity on the demand side can significantly reduce the storage capacity that should be procured by installing extra battery systems, to ensure the resiliency and reliability of the power grid under extreme conditions, resulting in considerable cost savings. In fact, having a good estimate of the total demand flexibility can mitigate the adverse effects of rolling blackouts on account of harsh weather conditions, as those experienced by the Texas power grid in February 2021, while notably reducing capital costs [8]. Furthermore, it has been shown that the demand side can actively participate and successfully compete with the supply side in providing ancillary services [9]. Dynamically characterizing demand flexibility is also important when assessing the potential of the demand side for providing ancillary services necessary to respond to mismatches between supply and demand, especially when more renewable energy sources are incorporated. Given the importance of quantifying demand flexibility, both DOE [1] and IEA EBC Annex 67 [2] have identified demand flexibility quantification as a research priority. Even though different quantification methods have been proposed for DF [10], a widely adopted methodology has not been yet developed, and DF quantification has been recognized as a research gap by both DOE and IEA EBC Annex 67. Reynders et al. [10] categorized the methodologies proposed in the literature for DF quantification into direct and indirect. Indirect approaches mainly demonstrate how effectively a control strategy can harness the Demand Flexibility Potential (DFP) of the building to, for instance, shift energy consumption from high-to low-price periods [11]. On the other hand, direct approaches aim to directly estimate the DFP of a building for a specified flexibility event in a bottom-up manner. Reynders et al. [12] proposed a direct approach based on set-point modulation to quantify the flexibility potentials of different building archetypes as well as the corresponding efficiencies. The set-point was decreased/increased in downward flexibility events for heating/cooling devices, and contrariwise, increased/decreased in upward flexibility events. Comparing the power curve obtained for the baseline case and those obtained for the downward and upward flexibility events gives the corresponding demand flexibility potentials and efficiencies of flexibility provision. Stinner et al. [6] proposed another direct framework that quantified flexibility assuming that the TES medium was fully charged (for delayed flexibility) or discharged (for forced flexibility) at the start of the flexibility interval. The framework required three power curves for quantifying flexibility. Such a framework allows for drawing a comparison between a TES, such as a water storage tank, and a battery storage. The estimated flexibility potential for a certain flexibility event depends on the heating/cooling demand of the building as well as the capacity of the heating/cooling system. De Coninck and Helsen [13] quantified the DFP of a building based on three model predictive control (MPC) simulations. The energy system in this study was equipped with both passive (the building envelope) and active TES (buffer tanks). Due to the predictive nature of MPC, the state of charge of the TES medium is altered according to the requested flexibility event in order to maximize the flexibility. Thus, using this approach, DF is quantified from the same perspective as in Ref. [6]. A similar MPC-based methodology was proposed by Oldewurtel et al. [14] but for quantifying DF according to instantaneous power shifting requests. Building energy problems are all prone to uncertainty. Uncertainty can come from weather forecasts [15], the building envelope [16], the heating/cooling system [17], occupant behavior [18], and the available reduced-order model. Oldewurtel et al. [19] demonstrated that ignoring uncertainty in building control could bring about considerable thermal comfort violation. Thus, disregarding uncertainty when quantifying the flexibility potential of a building may jeopardize the thermal comfort of the occupants when the building is asked to provide that much flexibility to the grid. Dealing with uncertainty in the context of building demand flexibility is limited to quantifying the uncertainty in the flexibility that can be provided by a building cluster because of uncertain parameters. Existing studies have used sampling-based approaches for this kind of uncertainty analysis [20,21]. One of the main drawbacks of the deployed sampling-based approaches for quantifying the DFP is the need for a large number of energy-related simulations for convergence [22]. This shortcoming is aggravated when the control scheme used in each simulation gets more complicated. Also, if the purpose is to directly quantify both the upward and downward flexibility potentials for different flexibility events, the number of required simulations will significantly increase and may become intractable. We posit that incorporating the uncertainty into the control signal using robust stochastic control schemes would significantly lower the computational burden by reducing the number of required simulations to three, as before. To date, some efforts have been made to come up with stochastic model predictive control (SMPC) schemes that can incorporate the uncertainty into the control law sent to the actuator [23]. Although SMPC approaches have proven beneficial to coping with uncertainty in building energy control problems, to the best of the authors\u2019 knowledge, they have never been employed to tackle the problem of flexibility quantification. In fact, thus far, no methodology has been proposed to directly quantify the potential of a building for DF provision under uncertainty. Based on the preceding literature review, we found that the existing literature lacks a computationally efficient predictive methodology that can directly quantify the maximum DFP of a building while taking different uncertainties into consideration as also acknowledged in Ref. [24]. In this study, we propose a bottom-up direct SMPC-based methodology that can account for Gaussian uncertainty arising from inaccurate weather forecasts and the available reduced-order model, representing the building and its energy system, when quantifying DF. The proposed methodology can be applied to conservatively and directly quantify the flexibility potential when a specific flexibility activation event is introduced. The proposed methodology is computationally efficient as the uncertainty is incorporated into the control action, eliminating the need for a large number of energy-related simulations. This paper also seeks to evaluate how different uncertainties can affect the predicted DFP and efficiency of flexibility provision. Moreover, the use of SMPC enables us to build upon the work of Stinner et al. [6] and conservatively charge/discharge the passive TES according to the specified flexibility event and unravel the inherent flexibility potential of the building. The proposed approach is also less prone to model mismatch errors than that proposed in Ref. [13], as it is coupled to a TRNSYS co-simulation platform providing a hybrid representation of the building and its HVAC system. TRNSYS is a building energy simulation program commonly used for investigating building thermal and energy performance. The measurement from the smart thermostat of the building can substitute for the feedback from TRNSYS if the approach is to be implemented in an experimental study. We believe that the conservative nature of the SMPC-based approach gives more realistic estimates of the flexibility potential of a building and helps energy aggregators and grid operators with both short- and long-term energy supply plans. 2 Methodology In this paper, we focus on demand flexibility that can be provided by a building and its heating system under uncertainty while maintaining the occupants\u2019 thermal comfort. It is noteworthy that the proposed methodology is generic and can be applied to quantify the flexibility potential of the building regardless of the heating system. The results obtained using the SMPC-based approach, proposed in this study, are compared with those obtained using the demand flexibility quantification approach proposed in Ref. [13], that is based on Deterministic Model Predictive Control (DMPC), to see how uncertainty can affect the predicted flexibility potential and efficiency of flexibility provision. The proposed methodology utilizes the predictive nature of model predictive control (MPC) to quantify the maximum upward and downward flexibility potentials. Fig. 1 provides a graphical description of upward and downward modulation (flexibility) events. The methodology depends on three SMPC simulations. The first simulation serves as the reference case (baseline in Fig. 1) with the objective to minimize the energy consumption of the building (note that this paper tries to quantify DF regardless of any specific electricity market as in Ref. [6]). The second simulation aims to quantify the upward flexibility potential, energy consumption is encouraged by setting the price during the flexibility interval to a large negative value. The third simulation aims at quantifying the downward flexibility potential in which the associated price during the flexibility interval is considered to be a high value so as to discourage energy consumption. It is noteworthy that, in the last two simulations, price acts just as an agent to encourage/discourage energy consumption. The deviation in the energy consumption during the flexibility interval from that in the reference case is regarded as the flexibility that the building can provide, and the deviation in the total energy consumption is the extra energy consumption for the sake of flexibility provision. One important parameter to consider when quantifying the energy flexibility potential is the efficiency of flexibility provision which specifies how much extra energy consumption is required (deviation in the total energy consumption) per provided flexibility. The introduced metrics are mathematically defined below: (1) F l e x i b i l i t y P o t e n t i a l = ∫ t D R , s t a r t t D R , e n d | Q D R − Q R E F | d t (2) E x t r a E n e r g y C o n s u m p t i o n f o r F l e x i b i l i t y P r o v i s i o n = ∫ 0 ∞ | Q D R − Q R E F | d t (3) E f f i c i e n c y o f F l e x i b i l i t y P r o v i s i o n = 1 − ∫ 0 ∞ | Q D R − Q R E F | d t ∫ t D R , s t a r t t D R , e n d | Q D R − Q R E F | d t where Q R E F and Q D R denote heating power in the reference and DR cases, respectively. t D R , s t a r t and t D R , e n d designate the times at which the specified flexibility event starts and ends, respectively. Fig. 2 illustrates a schematic of the proposed framework for quantifying demand flexibility under uncertainty. 2.1 SMPC formulation for quantifying demand flexibility This study investigates the effect of considering uncertainty on the estimated building flexibility potential using SMPC. The benchmark with which the results are compared is the DMPC-based approach proposed in Ref. [13]. The formulation of the DMPC-based approach is summarized in Section S1 of the Supplementary Information (SI). Stochastic model predictive control is recognized as a well-established approach to coping with uncertainty. The discrete-time time-invariant linear model representing the thermal dynamics of the building takes the following form in SMPC: (4) x k + 1 = A x k + B u k + E w k + F v k y k = C x k where x k , u k , w k , v k , and y k refer to the vectors containing the states, control inputs, required weather information, disturbances, and measurements at time k, respectively. In this specific problem, the control input ( u k ) is the heating output of the heating system, and the measurement ( y k ) is the indoor air temperature. The disturbances are assumed to be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) and follow Gaussian distributions of the form N ( 0,1 ) . The proposed methodology is easily generalizable to other Gaussian disturbances by manipulating the F matrix accordingly [25]. In this paper, we use a black-box model, as explained in Section 2.2.2, to extract the required matrices namely A , B , E , F , and C , but the overall methodology is generalizable to other models as well. If we define a prediction horizon, denoted by N , Eq (4) can be recast as: (5) x k = A x k + B u k + E w k + F v k y k = C x k where x k = [ x k + 1 | k T \u2026 x k + N | k T ] T , y k = [ y k + 1 | k T \u2026 y k + N | k T ] T , w k = [ w k | k T \u2026 w k + N − 1 | k T ] T , and v k = [ v k | k T \u2026 v k + N − 1 | k T ] T . Matrices A , B , E , F , and C can be expressed in terms of A , B , E , F , C , and N as follows: (6) A = [ A A 2 ⋮ A N ] , B = [ B 0 ⋯ 0 A B B ⋯ 0 ⋮ ⋮ ⋱ ⋮ A N − 1 B A N − 2 B ⋯ B ] , E = [ E 0 ⋯ 0 A E E ⋯ 0 ⋮ ⋮ ⋱ ⋮ A N − 1 E A N − 2 E ⋯ E ] , F = [ F 0 ⋯ 0 A F F ⋯ 0 ⋮ ⋮ ⋱ ⋮ A N − 1 F A N − 2 F ⋯ F ] , C = [ C 0 ⋯ 0 0 C ⋯ 0 ⋮ ⋮ ⋱ ⋮ 0 0 ⋯ C ] The control input is assumed to be an affine function of the disturbances as suggested in Ref. [26]: (7) u k = h k + Θ k v k Both h k and Θ k are the results (decision variables) of a stochastic optimization problem and can be represented as: (8) h k = [ h k | k T \u2026 h k + N − 1 | k T ] T , Θ k = [ 0 0 ⋯ 0 0 θ k + 1 , k 0 ⋯ 0 0 θ k + 2 , k θ k + 2 , k + 1 ⋯ 0 0 ⋮ ⋮ ⋱ ⋮ 0 θ k + N − 1 , k θ k + N − 1 , k + 1 ⋯ θ k + N − 1 , k + N − 2 0 ] It is clear that Θ k must be a lower-block triangular matrix with diagonal elements equal to zero block matrices for causality purposes. On account of the presence of uncertainty acting on the building, the constraints are supposed to be satisfied only with a given probability. In other words, the constraints of the optimization problem should be formulated as chance-constrained ones in which: (9) ∀ k : P r { u k ≤ u 0 } ≥ 1 − α u , P r { y k ≤ y 0 } ≥ 1 − α y where u 0 and y 0 specify the bounds of the control inputs and measurements, respectively, and α represents the probability of constraint violation (considered to be 0.1 throughout this study). The only control input in the formulated optimization problem is the heating output provided by the heating system ( Q k + m ). According to Eq (7), it can be expressed as: (10) ∀ k : Q k + m = h k + m | k + ∑ n = 0 m − 1 θ k + m , k + n v k + n , m ∈ [ 0 N − 1 ] As we are encountering a stochastic model predictive control problem, the objective must be the minimization of the expected value of the cost function presented in Eq (S4), thus: (11) ∀ k : J = E [ ∑ m = 0 N − 1 ( c k + m ( h k + m | k + ∑ n = 0 m − 1 θ k + m , k + n v n ) + c k + m + 1 c o m f , u p Δ T k + m + 1 c o m f , u p + c k + m + 1 c o m f , d o w n Δ T k + m + 1 c o m f , d o w n ) ] where the first term on the right-hand side of the equation designates the energy cost, and the other two terms are used to soften the thermal comfort constraints. c k + m , Q k + m , c k + m + 1 c o m f , and Δ T k + m + 1 c o m f refer to the energy price per kilowatt hour (kWh), heat provided by the heating system, price associated with violating the thermal comfort constraints, and thermal comfort violation, respectively. As the disturbances acting on the system are assumed to follow a Gaussian distribution of the form N ( 0 , I ) , the cost function can be simplified as follows: (12) ∀ k : J = E [ ∑ m = 0 N − 1 ( c k + m h k + m | k + c k + m + 1 c o m f , u p Δ T k + m + 1 c o m f , u p + c k + m + 1 c o m f , d o w n Δ T k + m + 1 c o m f , d o w n ) ] As shown in Eq (9), the constraints can be illustrated as: (13) ∀ k : P r { Q k ≤ Q 0 } ≥ 1 − α u → P r { h k + Θ k v k ≤ Q 0 } ≥ 1 − α u ∀ k : P r { y k ≤ T max } ≥ 1 − α y → P r { C ( A x k + B h k + B Θ k v k + E w k + F v k ) ≤ T max } ≥ 1 − α y ∀ k : P r { y k ≥ T min } ≥ 1 − α y → P r { C ( A x k + B h k + B Θ k v k + E w k + F v k ) ≥ T min } ≥ 1 − α y where Q 0 denotes the nominal heating capacity of the heating system, and T m i n and T m a x demarcate the thermal comfort zone. The lower and upper thermal comfort bounds are selected according to the Ecobee Donate your Data smart thermostat dataset and equal to 18 ( T m i n ) and 22 °C ( T m a x ), respectively [27]. Defining another thermal comfort band is equivalent to assigning another thermal storage potential to the building and does not affect the generality of the proposed approach. The above-mentioned constraints can be recast as deterministic second-order cone constraints as below: (14) ∀ k : h k ≤ Q 0 − Φ − 1 ( 1 − α u ) Θ k 2 ∀ k : C ( A x k + B h k + E w k ) ≤ T max − Φ − 1 ( 1 − α y ) C ( B Θ k + F ) 2 ∀ k : C ( A x k + B h k + E w k ) ≥ T min + Φ − 1 ( 1 − α y ) C ( B Θ k + F ) 2 where Φ represents the standard Gaussian cumulative function, and Φ − 1 refers to its inverse, namely the quantile function. Thermal comfort is tried to be maintained by introducing soft constraints into the optimization problem. As a result, the constraints of the optimization problem can be recast as follows: (15) ∀ k : h k ≤ Q 0 − Φ − 1 ( 1 − α u ) Θ k 2 ∀ k : C ( A x k + B h k + E w k ) ≤ T max + Δ T k comf , up − Φ − 1 ( 1 − α y ) C ( B Θ k + F ) 2 ∀ k : C ( A x k + B h k + E w k ) ≥ T min − Δ T k comf , down + Φ − 1 ( 1 − α y ) C ( B Θ k + F ) 2 ∀ k : Δ T k comf , up ≥ 0 ∀ k : Δ T k comf , down ≥ 0 Any thermal comfort violation is penalized in the cost function according to Eq (12). The prediction horizon considered in this study is 24 h as a longer horizon would make the optimization problem computationally demanding. It is to be noted that the number of variables to be optimized in Θ k is dependent on ( N − 1 ) 2 . By solving the optimization problem, at each time step, a sequence of control inputs is obtained for the whole prediction horizon. Only the first input is applied to the system (receding horizon MPC), and the system's output acts as feedback for the controller. A Kalman filter is utilized to reconstruct the state vector at each time step as per the feedback. More discussion about the Kalman filter algorithm can be found in Section S2 of the SI. For each simulation, a 4-day warm-up period is considered to eliminate the effects of the initial conditions and let the controller stabilize. 2.2 Case study 2.2.1 System description The proposed demand flexibility quantification framework is tested on a residential building located in Caroline, NY, USA. The building is equipped with a water-based underfloor heating system supplied by an electric resistance heater with a capacity of 16 kW. Fig. 3 depicts the floor plan of the building. The thermo-physical properties of the building's envelope are reported in Table 1 . In this study, only space heating is investigated, and the required storage capacity is assumed to be provided by the indoor air and building's envelope. The heating demand of the building is met by four radiant floor loops with a total water mass flow rate of 1272 kg h−1. There is no mechanical ventilation in the building, and the building's need for fresh air is satisfied by infiltration. The required infiltration was calculated according to ASHRAE standard 62.1\u20132019 [28] and set to 0.5 ACH. 1 1 Air Change per Hour. The rate of heat gain from the occupants was assumed to be 120 W/person. The occupancy pattern was adopted from the available schedules in the ResStock™ analysis tool developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) [29]. The internal heat gains from lighting and equipment was obtained from the Pecan Street dataset [30]. The building and its heating system were simulated in TRNSYS, which is considered as a true representation of the real system. The simulation data obtained from TRNSYS was used to develop a reduced-order black-box model that can be used for SMPC simulations. 2.2.2 System identification In this paper, a reduced-order linear discrete-time state-space model was developed based on the subspace system identification (4SID) method [31]. The subspace method is a powerful statistical data-driven method for identification of multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems when a large dataset is available and has been widely used for building modeling in research works concerning building predictive control as reviewed in Ref. [32]. Similar to other black-box models, this approach does not require a detailed understanding of the building thermal dynamics. In the model used in this study, the inputs are ambient temperature, Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI), internal gains, and the heating output of the heating system, and the output is indoor air temperature. The order of the model should be appropriately chosen using trial and error until the minimum fitting error on the test data is achieved. For training the model, data was generated in TRNSYS from January 1, 2017 to May 31, 2017 with different heating outputs generated at random with a sampling rate of 1 h. The ambient conditions used for training the model were extracted from the meteorological data obtained from the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) [33] for Binghamton, NY (the nearest location) in year 2017. The generated model was tested with another set of random heating outputs and under the ambient conditions of Caroline, NY in year 2019. For this specific building, a 7th-order model best represented the thermal dynamics. Fig. 4 illustrates indoor air temperature over time predicted by the developed black-box model against that obtained by a detailed simulation of the building and its heating system in TRNSYS. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) obtained is equal to 0.4859 °C. 2.3 Sources of uncertainty Two sources of uncertainty are considered in this paper, namely weather forecasts and the available reduced-order model. As can be inferred from Eq (15), the SMPC formulation is, in essence, a dynamic bound-tightening optimization problem. To avert over-conservatism, it is of prime importance to get reasonable estimates of standard deviations of all uncertainties. Here, the standard deviations of the disturbances caused by the available inaccurate weather forecasts were estimated by analyzing historical weather data. All the required weather data was obtained from NSRDB [33]. The weather data from a nearby town, Binghamton, NY was used for the forecasts. Fig. 5 illustrates the actual distributions, fitted normal distributions, and quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots for the ambient temperature and global horizontal irradiance forecast errors obtained from the historical weather data available for the last three years. The R2 values calculated for the Q-Q plots indicate that the normality assumption for the given distributions is fairly viable as also noted in Ref. [19]. From another perspective, the skewness and kurtosis of the error distribution for the ambient temperature forecasts are equal to −0.3652 and 3.7342, respectively. For the solar irradiance forecasts, the skewness and kurtosis of the error distribution are equal to −0.2173 and 3.1429, respectively. The skewness and kurtosis values obtained suggest that it stands to reason to assume these two disturbances follow normal distributions according to Ref. [34] (substantial non-normality does not hold). The uncertainty in the developed reduced-order model is considered as white noise acting on the first state as it is the dominating element of the state vector according to the obtained C matrix (Eq (4)). It is noteworthy that the standard deviation of the white noise depends on the specific period considered for testing the model. 3 Results and discussion Here, the inherent flexibility potential of the building and its heating system (regardless of any specific electricity market) is conservatively quantified by taking uncertainties into consideration. Section 3.1 seeks to investigate how considering uncertainty in weather forecasts and the available reduced-order model affects the flexibility potential and efficiency of flexibility provision. A comparison is drawn between the results obtained using the SMPC-based approach and those obtained using the DMPC-based approach. Furthermore, we try to scrutinize the effect of extra conservatism on different flexibility parameters and thermal comfort by considering different standard deviations for each disturbance. Hereafter, σ s e t denotes the standard deviation obtained from Fig. 5. In Section 3.2, these investigations are conducted for three days with different ambient conditions, namely \u201cAverage\u201d, \u201cMild\u201d and \u201cHarsh\u201d as described in Table 2 , to investigate whether the general trend is affected by ambient conditions. Section 3.3 investigates the effect of considering different standard deviations on the flexibility potential and improving thermal comfort satisfaction. Section 3.4 sheds light on the effect of the employed control algorithm on indoor air temperature and, in turn, the flexibility potential. Given the level of insulation and thermal inertia (underfloor heating system) of the house, it can be used for providing flexibility over long periods [11,35]. Flexibility events with different durations, namely 8, 10, and 12 h, are considered. It is noteworthy that the effect of uncertainty on the energy consumption during the flexibility interval can be better seen with longer durations. In this study, it is assumed that the downward flexibility events start at 4 p.m. and the upward ones start at 8 a.m. The start time of the downward events is such selected so as to reduce energy consumption during the mid- and on-peak periods identified by the New York State Electric and Gas Corporation (NYSEG) [36]. The start time of the upward events is such chosen to increase energy consumption as much as possible when there is a greater potential for solar power generation. It is to be noted that the time at which the flexibility event starts obviously affects the flexibility potential values determined by the framework, but the general effect of uncertainty (increase or decrease in the DFP) and its significance can be noticed regardless of the start time of the event. 3.1 Results obtained for the average weather conditions 3.1.1 Flexibility potential The flexibility potentials obtained under the Average weather conditions (January 18, 2019) are illustrated in Fig. 6 , which indicates that the flexibility is, in general, more affected by the uncertainty arising from ambient temperature forecasts rather than that from solar irradiance forecasts. It is to be noted that the effect of uncertainty on the estimated DFP can be better seen in the results obtained for upward flexibility as explained in Section S3 of the SI. The fact that the contribution of the uncertainty from solar irradiance forecasts is smaller is good news as, in principle, it is difficult to get accurate predictions of solar irradiance. Nevertheless, the effect of the uncertainty from solar irradiance forecasts should be investigated for more specialized buildings, especially those designed to leverage low sun angles in the winter for heating purposes. The effect may be more significant for those buildings than that seen in Fig. 6. Obviously, using other weather forecasts with different accuracies (i.e., different standard deviations from those obtained from Fig. 5) can lead to different flexibility potentials. Furthermore, assuming a large value for the standard deviation of the white noise (Section 2.3) can result in a dramatic deviation from the flexibility potential predicted by the DMPC-based approach. Therefore, developing an accurate model seems essential to surmount the problem of over-conservatism. Another point that commands careful consideration is that the predicted flexibility when the uncertainties are taken into consideration can significantly differ from that predicted by the DMPC-based approach proposed in Ref. [13]. Table 3 presents the drop in the predicted flexibility potential of the building when the proposed SMPC-based approach is used in lieu of the DMPC-based approach. The generally positive values reported in this table show that the DMPC-based approach tends to estimate a higher flexibility potential than the SMPC-based approach. Also, the generally more significant effect of the uncertainty from ambient temperature forecasts or the reduced-order model is clear in Table 3. More elaborate discussion about the effect of uncertainty on the flexibility potential is provided in Section S3 of the SI. The higher flexibility potential estimated with the DMPC-based approach comes at the price of more potential thermal comfort violation. Fig. 7 depicts the estimated downward flexibility potentials together with the corresponding thermal comfort violations for different standard deviations of the uncertainty from ambient temperature forecasts. Thermal comfort violation is quantified by investigating indoor air temperature and seeing if it is within the specified thermal comfort zone (between 18 and 22 °C). Given the level of insulation of the building, the windows being double-glazed, and the low infiltration rate, indoor air temperature is very close to operative temperature (the average difference is around 0.3 °C). It is to be mentioned that, in this study, the controller controls air temperature rather than operative temperature as it is easier to predict with the developed black-box model. Fig. 7 shows that the conservative nature of SMPC can significantly lower the risk of thermal comfort violation testifying to the fact that it can give more realistic estimates of the flexibility potential. More discussion about thermal comfort is presented in Section 3.3. 3.1.2 Efficiency of flexibility provision Efficiency of flexibility provision is a metric to measure how much of the energy stored before the start of the flexibility interval (for downward flexibility events) or during the flexibility interval (for upward flexibility events) is used for meeting the heating demand rather than be lost. It is noteworthy that, by definition, with an MPC-based demand flexibility quantification approach, more total energy consumption is ineluctable when the building is to provide flexibility than in the baseline (reference) case. The efficiencies obtained under the Average weather conditions (January 18, 2019) are illustrated in Fig. 8 . As can be seen from the presented results, no general trend can be observed for efficiency of flexibility provision. It can vary with the duration of the flexibility interval, source of uncertainty, and standard deviation. It is expected that changing the envelope properties of the building such as the level of insulation or the thermal capacity changes the efficiency values as noted in Ref. [35]. 3.2 Effect of weather conditions To evaluate if the results obtained in Section 3.1 are generalizable to other days with different weather conditions, the same simulations have been performed under the Mild and Harsh weather conditions specified in Table 2. Since the effect of uncertainty can be better noticed with a longer duration flexibility interval, here, we report only the results obtained with a duration of 12 h. 3.2.1 Flexibility potential Fig. 9 seeks to draw a comparison between the flexibility potentials obtained under different weather conditions. As can be seen in this figure, the obtained downward/upward flexibility potentials are lower than those given by the DMPC-based approach under all the weather conditions considered bearing witness that the DMPC-based approach can overestimate the potential of the building for demand flexibility provision. Also, it can be observed that increasing the standard deviation of the uncertainty brings about a reduction in the estimated flexibility potential to ensure thermal comfort satisfaction. Under all the weather conditions, as seen in Section 3.1, the uncertainty from ambient temperature forecasts or the reduced-order model seems to affect the results more than that from solar irradiance forecasts and should be taken into consideration so as to get a reasonable estimate of the flexibility potential. The drop in the predicted flexibility potential of the building under the Mild and Harsh weather conditions, when the proposed SMPC-based approach is used in lieu of the DMPC-based approach, is reported in Table S1. Section S4 of the SI is devoted to a detailed discussion of the information presented in this table. 3.2.2 Efficiency of flexibility provision Fig. 10 depicts the estimated efficiencies of flexibility provision obtained under different weather conditions. The results do not follow any general trend, and efficiency can change with the source of uncertainty, considered standard deviation, and weather conditions. A part of the stored energy before the start of or during the flexibility interval is used for providing flexibility, and the other part is lost. Less stored energy means both less loss and less flexibility; thus, efficiency can be volatile depending on the above-mentioned factors. All the efficiencies obtained under different weather conditions, for both upward and downward events, are above 84% testifying that the building and its heating system can be efficiently used for flexibility provision over long periods. The high efficiencies obtained can be attributed to the fairly high level of insulation of the building. 3.3 Effect of uncertainty on thermal comfort satisfaction and the issue of over-conservatism Table 4 reports thermal comfort violation for different standard deviations considered for the uncertainties in different downward and upward flexibility events on January 13, 2019 (the Harsh weather conditions). As can be seen, introducing uncertainty into the quantification approach seems vital as, without considering uncertainty, the total thermal comfort violation can be significant. Therefore, when an erroneous reduced-order model and/or inaccurate weather forecasts are available, significant thermal comfort violation may be seen when the grid asks the building to provide the amount of flexibility predicted with the DMPC algorithm. Another important consideration is how conservative the SMPC algorithm should be. In essence, the SMPC-based approach aims at conservatively quantifying flexibility so that thermal comfort is not compromised. As illustrated, the SMPC-based approach often predicts the flexibility potential of the building to be lower than that predicted with the DMPC-based approach. Also, increasing the standard deviation of the uncertainty can have a dramatic effect on the predicted flexibility potential. To have a reasonable estimate of the flexibility a building can provide to the grid, it is of paramount importance to investigate how introducing uncertainty into the MPC algorithm ameliorates thermal comfort satisfaction. The best estimate is obtained when the quantification methodology yields the best trade-off between thermal comfort violation and energy consumption. Considering the information presented in Table 4 and Table S1, it can be inferred that, when the duration of the downward flexibility interval is 12 h, tripling the standard deviation of the uncertainty from ambient temperature forecasts can reduce thermal comfort violation by 23.7 K h while resulting in a 13.2% decrease in the predicted flexibility potential. The same increase in the standard deviation, for the upward flexibility event, improves thermal comfort by 24.6 K h while resulting in a 30.3% drop in the predicted flexibility potential. It is occupant preferences that determine whether such improvements in thermal comfort satisfaction are worth such reductions in the flexibility and the potential reward for flexibility provision. Taking a look at Table 4 and Fig. 9, it stands to reason to put a good deal of effort into coming up with accurate estimates of the statistical properties of the Gaussian disturbances acting on the system so as to get more realistic estimates of the flexibility potential and avert over-conservatism. 3.4 Effect of the control algorithm on indoor air temperature and the flexibility potential The flexibility quantification results obtained can be justified by looking at the indoor air temperature evolutions. Fig. 11 depicts the indoor air temperature evolutions obtained under different uncertainties with different standard deviations when downward flexibility is asked for on January 18, 2019 (the Average weather conditions). As can be seen in Fig. 11, increasing the standard deviation of the uncertainty increases indoor air temperature, and in turn, leads to more energy consumption. Also, increasing the standard deviation of the uncertainty arising from ambient temperature forecasts or the reduced-order model has more pronounced effects on indoor air temperature than increasing the standard deviation of the uncertainty from solar irradiance forecasts. This partially justifies why the effect of the uncertainty from ambient temperature forecasts or the reduced-order model on the estimated flexibility potential was more significant (Figs. 6 and 9). On the other hand, thanks to the predictive nature of the employed approach for quantifying flexibility, the controller increases the temperature of the zone just before the start of the flexibility interval in order to maximize the flexibility the building can provide. In fact, in this study, indoor air temperature can represent the state of charge of the TES, namely the indoor air and the building envelope. The uncertainty also affects the ability of the controller to increase the temperature before the start of the flexibility interval due to the upper-bound tightening. When the duration of the flexibility interval is 12 h, with the standard deviations reported in Fig. 5, the temperature at the beginning of the flexibility interval is equal to 21.3 °C. Tripling the standard deviation of the uncertainty from ambient temperature forecasts reduces this temperature to 20.8 °C, while tripling the standard deviation of the uncertainty from solar irradiance forecasts reduces it to 21.0 °C. Increasing the standard deviation of the modeling uncertainty from 0.001 to 0.003 decreases this temperature from 21.5 °C to 20.9 °C. Even though the reported differences may look small at first glance, they have high energy consumption implications given the slow thermal dynamics of the building and its heating system (because of the high thermal inertia of the underfloor heating system). Under the Average weather conditions, the heating system needs to provide, on average, around 61 kWh of energy to increase indoor air temperature by 1 °C. A lower indoor air temperature just before the start of the flexibility interval reflects the lower state of charge of the passive TES. Hence, we can see how the uncertainty from ambient temperature forecasts or the reduced-order model generally causes more significant reductions in the estimated flexibility potential (Table 3). The same investigation is conducted for the case where the grid asks for upward flexibility. Fig. 12 depicts indoor air temperature over time under different uncertainties with different standard deviations when upward flexibility is asked for on January 5, 2019 (the Mild weather conditions). Increasing the standard deviation of the uncertainty should restrict energy consumption and the maximum temperature seen during the flexibility interval on account of the upper-bound tightening. When the duration of the flexibility interval is 12 h, with the standard deviations reported in Fig. 5, the average power consumption during the flexibility interval is equal to 11.22 kW (with a maximum temperature of 22.3 °C during the flexibility interval), while tripling the standard deviation of the uncertainty from ambient temperature and solar irradiance forecasts reduces the average power consumption to 9.62 kW (with a maximum temperature of 22.1 °C) and 9.67 kW (with a maximum temperature of 22.2 °C), respectively. Assuming the standard deviation of the modeling uncertainty to be equal to 0.001 and 0.003 decreases the average power consumption during the specified interval to 9.62 kW (with a maximum temperature of 22.5 °C) and 6.76 kW (with a maximum temperature of 22.0 °C), respectively. With a larger standard deviation for the uncertainty, the tighter upper bound acts in concert with the higher energy consumption during the flexibility interval in the reference case providing compelling evidence for the drops in the predicted upward flexibility potential (Table S1). 4 Conclusion Quantifying demand flexibility is important for decision makers as it can give the storage capability of the demand side under different conditions, especially under extreme conditions caused by inclement weather, mitigating the need for installing oversized battery storage systems and, in turn, leading to significant cost savings. Furthermore, it can be regarded as a tool that can dynamically give the system operator the potential of the demand side for ancillary services provision when the demand side is actively participating in the power market to ensure the power grid's resiliency and reliability. In this study, an SMPC-based framework has been proposed for direct demand flexibility quantification in a bottom-up manner under uncertainty. The proposed framework has been utilized to quantify the potential of a building for providing flexibility over long periods under different ambient conditions. It has been demonstrated that uncertainty can highly affect the flexibility the building can provide to the grid. The flexibility potential and efficiency of flexibility provision obtained using the proposed approach have been compared with those obtained using the DMPC-based approach proposed in Ref. [13]. The key takeaways of this study are succinctly delineated below: \u2022 First, the DMPC-based approach tends to overestimate the flexibility potential due to neglecting different uncertainties, and thus, thermal comfort may be compromised when the estimated flexibility is provided under real conditions. \u2022 Second, the effect of uncertainty on efficiency of flexibility provision does not follow a general trend and depends on weather conditions, the source of uncertainty, and the standard deviation of the uncertainty. \u2022 Third, accurate estimates of statistical properties of different uncertainties are very important. An overly conservative MPC algorithm can result in a large drop in the predicted flexibility potential without further improvement of thermal comfort satisfaction. Having a good understanding of occupant preferences is a key factor in this process as it determines how much thermal comfort violation can be tolerated. \u2022 Fourth, the effect of the uncertainty from solar irradiance forecasts is minuscule in comparison to that of the uncertainty arising from ambient temperature forecasts and the reduced-order model. However, the effect should be further investigated for more specialized buildings, especially those designed to benefit from low sun angles in the winter for heating purposes. \u2022 Fifth, as the effect of the modeling uncertainty has proven formidable, developing an accurate reduced-order model that best represents the thermal dynamics of the building is of paramount importance to avert unnecessary conservatism as much as possible. Future research should focus on coming up with more computationally efficient approaches for directly quantifying demand flexibility under uncertainty and testing the proposed framework in this study on different building archetypes, especially those representative of the building stock in the area of interest.

        "dc:description": "Quantification of demand flexibility is of key importance to decision makers at the planning level, when designing demand response programs and determining capacity requirements for new battery storage installations, and, at the operation level, when assessing the demand-side potential for providing grid services. While different frameworks have been proposed for demand flexibility quantification, the literature still lacks a framework that considers uncertainty sources, affecting building energy control problems, when directly quantifying the demand flexibility potential. We propose a novel framework based on stochastic model predictive control for direct demand flexibility quantification in a bottom-up manner that can account for uncertainty. The proposed framework is utilized to quantify the flexibility potential of a building under uncertainty arising from weather forecasts and the available reduced-order model. The results are compared with those obtained using an existing deterministic approach. We demonstrate that the deterministic approach tends to overestimate the flexibility potential on account of ignoring uncertainty, and the occupants\u2019 thermal comfort may be jeopardized if the grid asks for the flexibility estimated with the deterministic approach. The study accentuates the importance of developing an accurate model for model-based demand flexibility quantification owing to the significant effect of the modeling uncertainty.",
