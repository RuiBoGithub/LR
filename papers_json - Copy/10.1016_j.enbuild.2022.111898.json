Based on the measurements from an actual building, the grey-box building model was constructed using a decentralized approach. The simulation case study was then carried out to quantify the saving potential of the MPC compared to feedback control. For the cooling season, the saving percentage of the MPC exceeded 30%, while those of the intermediate season were reduced by approximately 20%. More savings were achieved when the outdoor air temperature and solar radiation were high. The size of the plenum was not sensitive to the saving rate. The large savings were attributed to precooling that utilizes the cheaper utility cost of the off-peak and higher efficiency of the HVAC plant. This suggests that the larger thermal mass of the under plenum, including the air and still structure (bracket), is suitable for maximizing pre-cooling of the system.

All areas of industry have endeavored to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The commercial building sector consumes one-fifth of the total energy among all sectors in the US, including the industrial, transportation, and residential sectors [1]. Therefore, reducing the building energy consumption and corresponding operation cost of the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system are considered one of the most urgent national issues to cope with the impending global crisis. The research and development of building energy-related industries have accelerated to adapt to the emerging international agreement and regulations. The approaches to reducing building energy consumption can be divided into passive and active. Traditionally, the former has been investigated in depth based on the improved design and efficiency of the building envelope and HVAC systems. As IoT (Internet of Things) technologies for sensing, computing, and communicating have developed, the latter approach has started to be researched recently. Model-based predictive control (MPC) is one of the advanced operation strategies that enable optimized control of the HVAC. The MPC solves the optimal control problem using the building\u2013thermal model and HVAC models with the predicted weather and disturbances, such as the occupants [2]. The first control signal from the optimized sequence is applied to an actual system. The new optimization problem is then solved using the predicted information newly added in the next time step. Many studies have examined the building energy and operation-related area since the 1990s [3]. From the most general HVAC system in the US, such as rooftop units (RTU) [4,5], to the large-sized HVAC systems, including the central air conditioner with a cooling tower [6], or a heat pump, relatively small scaled system [7], several studies have demonstrated its improved energy-saving performance compared to the typical feedback control while endeavoring to overcome challenges, such as modeling, data communication, and optimization formulation, as discussed in a previous study [8]. Other than the air system, the radiant floor system, also known as the thermally activated building system (TABS), has been studied [9,10,11]. This particular system has more saving potential than typical air-based systems because of its large thermal capacity when controlled optimally using properly estimated building models. The more savings are achieved as the thermal capacity of HVAC systems becomes larger. This is because the cooling energy can be stored in a building structure (i.e., concrete) and absorb heat through a heat sink when the electricity price is high during the on-peak daytime. Pre-cooling, also called load shifting, is the principal motive of the cost-savings demonstrated by simulations and actual implementation to buildings [12]. In addition, cost-saving with a pre-heating strategy of the radiant floor system was demonstrated in a TRNSYS-Matlab co-simulation testbed [13]. The saving was attributed to the pre-heating with the lower electricity cost in a daily-ahead electricity price. The thermal energy storage system with phase change material [14] and active brick structure [15] can also be leveraged with a predictive control strategy to provide the free-cooling with latent heat [14] and improve the energy flexibility [15]. A well-designed systematic simulation study reported up to 18 % energy-saving [14]. 1.2 Literature review The UFAD system is considered an advanced building HVAC system with a raised floor providing conditioned air only to the task area [16]. This is one of the task/ambient systems that selectively condition the space according to the thermal zoning [17]. The advantages of UFAD include an improved IAQ, pleasant comfort, reduced life cycle cost, and saved floor-to-floor height in new constructions [16,18,19]. Moreover, a flexible design layout can be another advantage as the diffusers can be rearranged according to the preference of the occupants and designers. This is used mainly for office buildings but can be configured for data centers. A previous study reported the energy-saving potential with improved airflow and temperature distribution of the data center based on a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation and experiment [20]. Many studies focused on its improved performance providing better thermal comfort while reducing energy consumption. For example, this system only conditions the task area according to the layout of the supply diffusers, and conditioned air is delivered directly to the occupants from the plenum without conditioning all the vertical sections. The annual energy saving potential compared to the typical air system is up to approximately 14%, according to a previous study [21]. This study utilized the calibrated building energy simulation model (specifically, EnergyPlus) compared to the CFD and experimental data from the testbed. In addition, some studies focused on the diffuser design. Two models for predicting the temperature stratification with different diffuser types, including the linear bar grill and variable air volume (VAV) diffuser, were developed based on several measurements from the test cell with a solar simulator [22]. The CFD simulation was conducted to examine the airflow and temperature distribution according to the design of the supply diffusers [23]. One of the issues in the UFAD system is thermal decay, which is the increased supply air temperature from the plenum. Even with a properly sized plenum system, 30% more electricity could be consumed in the UFAD system compared to the typical air system because of the thermal decay [24,25]. The increased energy consumption of the UFAD could be avoided by increasing the insulation between the room and the plenum. On the other hand, ductwork added under the plenum could resolve the supply air temperature increase, which was investigated using a CFD simulation [19]. The higher energy consumption of the UFAD reported by Yu et al. [24] is somewhat controversial compared to Xue and Chen [21]. This difference might have originated from the limitation of the simulation tools, setting of the simulation models, or layout of the diffusers (e.g., the number of diffusers in a zone). In addition, one study attempted to provide better comfort while reducing energy consumption with the UFAD (as a ventilation system) integrated with ceiling cooling (i.e., chiller beam). Approximately 13% of the cost savings were achieved while reaching the comfort range earlier than feedback control in a chamber test [26]. To the best of the authors\u2019 knowledge, there are no reports on the applicability of the UFAD system for MPC applications. On the other hand, the large thermal capacity of the plenum and its thermal decay, which was considered negative in terms of energy usage, can be leveraged for the MPC. This can be inferred from the improved MPC performance of the radiant floor system compared to the typical air system, as shown in previous studies [10,12]. Among the many control-oriented building models, the grey-box model is considered the most robust and accurate [27\u201329]. This model is simpler than building simulation programs, such as EnergyPlus or TRNSYS. On the other hand, this model maintains the physical structure, unlike a black-box model that only interprets the relationship between the input and output. The grey-box model is built with the heat balance equations in each building part, such as room air, envelope, and ceiling. The heat transfer phenomena between those parts are expressed with thermal resistance. The model parameters are not perfectly matched with actual heat transfer phenomena due to the simplicity of the structure but can be approximated using an inverse modeling approach. Unlike the forward model, this approach is built with optimization based on actual measurements and is called a data-driven inverse model. On the other hand, obtaining the proper grey-box model is the most time-consuming task for engineers. In one of the old discussions from the initial investigators, 70% of the labor/engineering cost is consumed in the modeling phase [30]. There is no standard or rule to set the scale and complexity of the model structure. In addition, adequate initial and bound model parameters are required, which are based on knowledge of the heat transfer phenomena through the building zones and envelope. As the complexity of the model structure increases, the search for optimal model parameters becomes degraded because of the non-linearity of the optimization process. Decentralized optimization methods have been attempted to overcome this issue. One of the traditional decomposition methods, dual decomposition, has been applied to the nonlinear optimization for the grey-box building modeling [10,12,31,32]. The entire building model is split into multiple small-scaled models. Optimization was carried out individually while converging the pair of complicating variables (thermally coupled variables, specifically), which are the thermal resistances between the split models. On the other hand, this approach does not guarantee an optimal solution because of the non-linearity of the grey-box model structure. Similarly, the primal decomposition method has the same issue. If the number of the complicated variables is finite and small, and two coupled variables are not too far, conducting all optimization cases for all combinations of the two variables would provide a near-global optimal solution. This approach borrows the idea from the primal decomposition but is more straightforward by applying a parametric simulation. There are some trade-offs between the optimality and the computational time influenced by the grid of the variables (i.e., how fine the variables are gridded). The novelty of this study is as follows: \u2022 The large saving potential of the UFAD via the MPC was demonstrated using the estimated building model. \u2022 A decentralized approach with simplified parametric optimization was investigated for grey-box building modeling. \u2022 The saving potential was quantified with the weather impact and UFAD design. 1.3 Objectives and paper organization This study examined the cost-saving performance of the UFAD using an advanced control method (i.e., MPC) compared to the feedback control. The performance was evaluated using a grey-box building model that was developed based on the decentralized optimization method. The cost-saving potential was quantified with simulation studies and analyzed using the weather and plenum design. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. The methodology is explained in section 2. Section 3 discusses building modeling. Section 4 outlines the simulation case study, and the conclusions and discussion are reported in sections 5 and 6, respectively. 2 Methodology 2.1 Building model structure In this study, a control-oriented building model was constructed using a grey-box model structure. This model is built with the heat balance equation in the form of a 1st order ordinary differential equation (ODE), as shown in Equation (1). The internal energy of the target node is expressed with the derivative of temperature multiplied by thermal capacity. The changing rate of the energy (left hand side) is equal to heat energy transfer from the adjacent node (Tadj ), such as neighboring zones or outdoor, and heat gain from an outdoor solar or internal source ( Q ̇ dist ). If the system is controlled, the control input ( Q ̇ ctrl ) term is added with the appropriate sign. (1) C p target T ̇ target ( t ) = 1 R adj ( T adj - T target ) + α dist Q ̇ dist + Q ̇ ctrl The equation above can be constructed for each node individually, including the zone air and envelope, and are called systems. To be used as a control-oriented building model, those systems are packed in a state space formulation as follows: (2) x ̇ = A x + B u (3) y = C x + D u 2.2 Decentralized modeling method A decentralized approach was investigated to facilitate the modeling process. Fig. 1 presents the generic example of this approach that consists of two zones. The optimizations for each zone are carried out individually with boundary temperature trajectories from the adjacent zones. Two different thermal resistance between the two zones are found. This coupling resistance is called a complicated variable in a decentralized optimization [33]. In this study, this variable was used for parametric optimization in a similar with a primal decomposition method. Specifically, the individual optimizations were carried with a fixed coupling variable. This process runs sequentially while changing the coupling variable with a proper discretized range. 2.3 Control methods This study used two control methods: conventional feedback control and proposed MPC. The optimization formulation of the MPC is based on linear programming that minimizes the electricity cost for cooling the zone. The room air temperature range was set as hard comfort bound in inequality constraint. As for feedback control, the current estimated building model was not realistic because of the time-step, which is 5 min. In particular, the time-step is higher than the typical practice of feedback control. The optimization formulation was used to mimic the feedback control in a similar manner to that for the MPC discussed previously. The electricity cost and efficiency of the HVAC system were dropped out from the objective function, which forms a temperature tracking problem. The room air temperature trajectories of the feedback control followed the upper comfort bound (23℃ in this study) as if the room was controlled using an ideal feedback controller. This provides a fair comparison between the two cases and gives conservative saving potential. 2.4 Boundary conditions The outdoor air temperature and solar radiation data were excerpted from the typical meteorological year (TMY3) The data of the Indianapolis in Indiana state to consider the representative weather profiles. The average electricity price was applied to the simulation [37], which is 12.7cents/kWh, while the demand charge was not considered. The time of use (TOU) was applied; the off-peak price was 8.47cents/kWh, and the on-peak price was 16.93cents/kWh. This is twice the off-peak price while maintaining an average cost of 12.7cents/kWh. The schedule of the on-peak was from noon to 6 pm. The comfort bound of the room air temperature was set between 20 and 23℃, which is the acceptable range in a typical office in the US. The initial state temperatures were set to 21.5℃, which is the middle value of the lower and upper comfort bound in room air temperature. 3 Control oriented building modeling 3.1 Testbed description The testbed building considered in this study was living lab 2 in the Herrick lab at Purdue University (Indiana, US). The four consecutive rooms on the second floor were designed for the independent experiments with various HVAC systems, including the AHU with a ceiling, wall, and UFAD, and radiant floor and ceiling systems (Fig. 2 ). Front view (left) and interior view (right) of the testbed building.). All rooms were conditioned with independent AHUs and VAVs located in the mechanical rooms. The three rooms were exposed to the double-skin facade on the south face. The living lab 2 (LL2) was considered, where the UFAD was installed with a floor plenum. The occupants were graduate students working with flexible occupancy schedules. The HVAC system of the entire building is managed by Niagara AX (Tridium INC [34]), one of the building automation systems. The temperature, humidity, airflow, water flow, and power consumption can be monitored in real-time and stored using the Niagara. In addition, National Instrument data acquisition was also applied to each room to measure the environment data in more detail. Fig. 3 shows the vertical section of the LL2. The height of the floor plenum was approximately 60 cm, and two air temperature sensors were installed. The room air temperature of the task area was measured, and the existing thermostat was located in the northern wall of the room. The cavity air temperature of the double-skin facade was also measured. The solar radiation was measured on the vertical south facade of the building exterior. 3.2 Experiment design The experiment was conducted for seven days (4\u201310 Aug 2018). The room air temperature was maintained between 22 and 23℃ for the entire experiment to prevent disturbing the occupants. Therefore, the pseudo-random binary signal (PRBS in short) was unavailable. Only the aggressive control input signal was applied by turning on the cooling and heating coils in turn. The airflow rate from the AHU to the under plenum was fixed at 1,260 CFM (2,141 m3/h) while the supply air temperature was varied. The feedback control was applied to the cooling coil valve to satisfy the room air temperature at the setpoint. The manual supply swirl diffusers on the floor between the under plenum and room were fully opened for the test period. The number of occupants was measured indirectly by a manual count at various times. The plug load for the entire room was measured, and the lighting was controlled by dimming control according to the occupancy. Those two were used to infer the number of occupants for the test period. Approximately 50 W was consumed by a single occupant based on a manual count. This value was small because not all occupants were working with computers. 3.3 Decentralized grey-box building modeling Fig. 4 shows the thermal network of the entire model based on the equations above. This was a 7R5C model. The state temperatures were illustrated with a white circle, while the boundary temperature was marked with grey. For clarity, the input term Q was not included. Two resistances were observed between the plenum and the room. The left resistance with an arrow was the unidirectional heat transfer via the supply airflow through the grill. This value was determined and not identified, assuming the constant airflow at 1250CFM (2,123 m3/h). The right resistance is the resistance through the floor that was estimated. Equations (4)\u2013(8) show the heat balance equations in each building state. T, Cp, and R refer to the temperature, thermal capacity, and thermal resistance, respectively. Each subscript for the capacity and temperature represents the location of each system. The subscript of the resistance between each system was named by choosing the first letter of both systems. The α multiplied to the Q refers to the percentage of heat absorbed in the state. The percentage of equipment and light heat gain is distributed to the envelope and room system with the coefficient αeqt.room to satisfy the heat balance of the model. The αeqt.room and αLGT.room were fixed to 0.6, which means 60% of the equipment and lighting heat gain goes to room air and 40% goes to the envelope.

They were discretized for modeling and control with a specific time-step, as shown in Equations (9) and (10). Discretization was conducted by calculating the solution of the ODE in current and one-step ahead of the time-step, which is calculated easily in Matlab with c2d. The subscript d represents the discretized values, and k is a time-step. A five-minute interval was used in this study. (9) x k + 1 = A d x k + B d u k (10) y [ k ] = C d x k + D d u [ k ] Fig. 5 shows the divided thermal network of the decentralized modeling approach. In the centralized approach, the number of estimated parameters was 14, including five capacities (Cpcav , Cproom , Cpenv , CpUFAD , and Cpsink ), five resistances (Roc , Rcr , Rre , Rru , Roe , and Rus ), and three coefficients (αsol.cav , αsol.room , and αsol.env ). In a decentralized approach, the single zone with a double-skin facade in the southern face and UFAD on the floor was split, as indicated by three colors. The blue, green, and red refer to the double-skin facade, room, and UFAD models, respectively. Each model takes the state temperature from the adjacent model, sets it as a boundary temperature, and runs the optimization individually. Owing to this independent optimization, the resistances between each sub-model resulted in different values that were supposed to be the same. This study obtained three sub-models, resulting in two thermally coupled resistances. In the context of the primal decomposition, there may be a master optimization problem with two decision variables. On the other hand, rather than process this optimization, the parametric simulation was attempted because the number of variables can be finite if the potential candidates are interpolated evenly between two coupling parameters. Three optimization problems were solved independently, while only the coupling variables were fixed. The estimated model parameters were then evaluated in their original model forms. The nonlinear optimization solver needs to be applied because of the non-linearity between the estimated parameters and the objective function that was minimized. fmincon in the Matlab environment was used (Mathwork [35]). Equation (11) shows the optimization formulation with decision variable P and the objective function, the RMSE. Y ^ and Y represents the simulated and measured air temperatures, respectively. The i and n refer to the time and number of data used in the estimation. (11) P ∗ = arg min P ∑ i = 1 n y ̂ i ( P ) - y i 2 / n - 1 The estimated parameters in the grey-box models are typically correlated, which is unavoidable. In some cases, unrealistic values can be found while still providing good prediction performance. To prevent those issues, the bound of the parameter was set considering the physical interpretation. For example, the lower bound of the room air capacity (Cproom ) was set as the pure air capacity of the room. The final capacity of the room is supposed to be higher than pure air capacity because of the indoor facility or furniture. The initial values for all estimated parameters were set based on the building design and prior knowledge. The initial thermal resistances between the outdoor, envelope, and room air were calculated using the convective heat transfer coefficients adopted from the building energy simulation programs, such as EnergyPlus or TRNSYS. The lower and upper bounds for the parameters were set with a power of ±102 (i.e., P0 × 10−2 < P < P0 × 102). Fig. 6 presents a 3D plot of the parametric simulations results. The horizontal axis represents two coupling variables, Rcr and Rru . The vertical axis represents the summed cvRMSE (coefficient of variation of the RMSE) of three RMSE from the sub-models. This study used cvRMSE, whose unit is the percentage, to normalize the error of each sub-model and summed value to evaluate the performance of the entire model. Table 1 lists the final model parameters. The capacity of each building part is reasonable. For example, the envelope capacity is larger than others. In addition, the room cavity is larger than the cavity and UFAD as it has more space. The resistance between the outdoor air and envelope (Roe ) is large. This is because the actual building is a high-performance building with massive insulation and the zone is surrounded by neighboring zones. Fig. 7 shows the modeling results of the estimation and validation sets applying optimally selected parameters, as explained previously. Three days from Aug 6\u20138 were used for the estimation. The validation was conducted, including four more days (two days added back and forth, respectively). The top three figures (a, b, and c) show the temperature comparison between the experiment (green solid line) and the estimation (red dotted line). The bottom three figures (d, e, and f) show the control and disturbance inputs, such as the internal heat gain, outdoor air temperature, and solar radiation. The predicted temperature trajectories (red dotted lines) were matched well with the measured ones (green line). The RMSE values of the three sub-models were 1.15, 0.32, and 0.90 ℃ for the double-skin façade, room, and UFAD, respectively, which are acceptable for use in the MPC. 4 MPC simulations 4.1 HVAC system model The actual HVAC system of the testbed was the AHU, which is not typical in practice. The four individual AHU serves each room independently to provide a separate indoor environment for a different test. In the MPC simulations, another HVAC product, an air-to-water heat pump, was assumed [36]. The HVAC model consisted of two polynomials: the energy input ratio (EIR) and capacity. The only EIR curve (Equation (12)) was used by assuming that the heat pump capacity is always higher than the cooling coil capacity (3.9 kW), which was calculated from the test during the modeling phase. The coefficients of the EIR curve were regressed from the catalog data, as shown in Fig. 8 . (12) EIR = c 0 + c 1 T out + c 2 T LW + c 3 T out 2 + c 4 T LW 2 + c 5 T out T LW The EIR is higher when the outdoor air temperature is low, and the leaving water temperature from the heat pump to the cooling coil is high. In the MPC simulation, the leaving water temperature was fixed to 7℃, which is a convention for a typical air system. The maximum capacity of the air-cooled HP was set to 3.9 kW based on the fixed airflow rate at 1250CFM (2,123 m3/h). 4.2 Optimization formulation The input (u) matrix in Equation (9) is split into the disturbance input (W) and control input (U), as shown in Equation (13). The state-space equation is iterated with time-step (k), which yields the linear relationship between the input (disturbance and control) and output (temperatures) along with the estimated building model in Ω, as shown in Equation (14). The final form can be applied to a typical optimization algorithm.

The bold font represents the vectors. The cooling rate is multiplied by the reciprocal (inversed) EIR and electricity cost (ε cost) while satisfying all the constraints, including the building dynamics and maximum control input. Tupper and Tlower represent the comfort bound of the zone. CT is the diagonal matrix for extracting the room air temperature from all state trajectories. The iterated state-space form with the building model in Equation (14) was included in the inequality constraints. As for feedback control, the EIR and εelec were dropped out from the objective function while all constraints remained the same.

Fig. 9 shows the six days (June 20\u201326) excerpted from the six months simulation results, and Table 2 provides a summary. The upper two figures show the room and UFAD air temperatures, while the lower two show the control and disturbance inputs. The pre-cooling through the UFAD is clearly shown in the MPC case, whereas feedback control only provides cooling during the occupied hours. The total cooling rate of the MPC was larger than that of the feedback control (13.93kWh vs. 17.29kWh). On the other hand, the total electricity consumption of the MPC was slightly lower than that of feedback control (1.54 kWh vs. 1.49 kWh) because of the higher EIR of the MPC. The averaged EIR of the feedback control and MPC were 9.07 and 11.62, respectively. Finally, the average daily cooling cost for the excerpted seven days was 20.45 cents and 12.90 cents for the feedback control and MPC, respectively. The resulting saving percentage of the MPC was 36.9%. The average cost per electricity usage was 13.32cents/kWh and 8.67cents/kWh in feedback control and MPC, respectively, which means that cooling was activated mostly during the off-peak hours in MPC. 4.3.2 Weather impact on saving The simulation results of the daily cooling cost were analyzed with two disturbance inputs, averaged solar radiation, and maximum outdoor air temperature, to determine the trend of the saving percentage of the MPC. Fig. 10 shows the saving percentage of the MPC (top) and cooling cost of the two control methods (bottom). The upper ones show the daily averaged saving as a percentage of the MPC (maximum, minimum, and average), while the lower ones represent the daily cooling cost of the MPC and feedback control. The mild days (e.g., consuming less than two cents per day in feedback control) were excluded. The saving of the MPC became higher when the solar radiation and outdoor air temperature were high. More than 30% of the cooling cost saving were achieved when the average solar radiation and maximum outdoor air temperature were higher than 220 W and 24℃, respectively. On the other hand, the impacts of those two disturbance inputs were correlated, e.g., the outdoor air temperature was high when solar radiation was high. Therefore, understanding the sole impact of one variable was limited. As explained previously, mild days were not included in the analysis. The MPC saving potential of those days was also low and were called \u201cno-saving days\u201d. Fig. 11 shows the monthly savings of the MPC with and without the no-saving-days. In the intermediate season, particularly in Apr and Oct, more than 1/3 days were no-saving days. On the other hand, the number of those days was negligible during summer (June\u2013Aug). Finally, more than 30% of the cost-saving was achieved during summer. 4.3.3 Sensitivity analysis of UFAD design In this section, the impact of the thermal capacity of the UFAD (CpUFAD in Eq. (4)) was investigated with a half and double capacity. Fig. 12 shows the averaged daily cooling cost of the feedback control and MPC on the left vertical axis, and the saving percentage of the MPC compared to the feedback control on the right vertical axis. The cooling cost became higher when the capacity was higher in MPC and vice versa in feedback control. On the other hand, its increase and decrease were small. The corresponding variation of the saving potential in MPC was not significant (33.3\u201334.9 %). 5 Conclusions This study examined the cost-saving potential of the UFAD with MPC in an office building. The grey-box building model was estimated with a decentralized fashion, which is scalable to the different or larger building systems. The validated building model against actual measurements simulated the MPC and feedback control. The specific findings from this study were summarized as follows: \u2022 The decentralized optimization successfully estimated the grey-box model of the UFAD with a double-skin façade in a single office zone. \u2022 The saving performance of the MPC compared to the feedback control was more than 30% during the summer and reduced in the intermediate season. \u2022 The more cooling cost saving of the MPC was achieved when the outdoor air temperature and solar radiation were high. \u2022 The impact of the UFAD capacity on the MPC saving percentage was not significant. As discussed in previous studies [38,12], the HVAC systems with a large thermal capacity, such as the radiant floor system, are suitable for maximizing the pre-cooling by the MPC, which yields tremendous cost savings. Overall, the UFAD system is a proper system for utilizing the pre-cooling for cost-saving while conditioning the zone with task/ambient fashion in terms of the vertical and horizontal zoning. 6 Discussion and future work This study conducted sensitivity analysis of the impact of the UFAD capacity (CpUFAD in Equation (4)) on the energy performance. Two additional cases were considered, including twice and half capacity. In the MPC simulation, more pre-cooling was achieved with more capacity, but the cooling rate increased. Therefore, an MPC with a larger UFAD capacity incurs a higher cooling cost, but this increase was small. Other than the two control approaches of this study, rule-based or feedforward control can be also investigated likewise a previously study [39]. A systematic logic for those control methods can be formulated based on the regression or machine learning technique. Control performance could be evaluated and possibly this can be proposed as a practical method whose performance is in the middle between the feedback and ideal MPC. Implementing the MPC in actual buildings is challenging because of the barrier between the computing optimizer (e.g., PC) and the existing building energy management system (BEMS). In addition, the optimizer needs to be light in terms of computation because the MPC iterates the optimization constantly every time step. Future studies will investigate the potential of mimicking the MPC with a simple rule extracted from the offline MPC simulations, e.g., pre-cooling hours based on the maximum outdoor air temperature. The performance of this rule-based model cannot exceed that of the actual MPC, but near-optimal control can be achieved without running the optimization. Furthermore, rather than applying this automatically, the rule can be suggested to engineers who operate the BEMS without replacing human resources with artificial intelligence (AI). This can be a middle stage or an alternative in automating the BEMS with AI, including the MPC.

        "dc:description": "This study investigated the operation cost-saving potential of an underfloor air distribution (UFAD) system by applying model-based predictive control (MPC). Based on the measurements from an actual building, the grey-box building model was constructed using a decentralized approach. The simulation case study was then carried out to quantify the saving potential of the MPC compared to feedback control. For the cooling season, the saving percentage of the MPC exceeded 30%, while those of the intermediate season were reduced by approximately 20%. More savings were achieved when the outdoor air temperature and solar radiation were high. The size of the plenum was not sensitive to the saving rate. The large savings were attributed to precooling that utilizes the cheaper utility cost of the off-peak and higher efficiency of the HVAC plant. This suggests that the larger thermal mass of the under plenum, including the air and still structure (bracket), is suitable for maximizing pre-cooling of the system.",
