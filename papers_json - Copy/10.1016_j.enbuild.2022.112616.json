Changes in the global energy landscape have increased the importance of research on energy management methods in the power grid. In particular, Demand Side Management (DSM) at consumers is attracting worldwide attention. Distributed generation in intelligent consumers, such as Smart Houses (SH), contributes to the introduction of new distributed generation from the demand side by determining optimal scheduling. However, Fuel-cells (FC) and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) are expensive, and their installation is a significant burden for the demand side. Therefore, this paper proposes a Smart Apartment Building (SAB) model in which multiple distributed power sources are shared by multiple consumers to reduce operation costs and carbon emissions through the implementation of highly efficient operation methods. An important aspect of such a study is to understand the characteristics of the demand side and to propose an operating method that takes into account the preferences of the demand side. In this paper, to provide a variety of options, a Pareto front is generated through multi-objective optimization to reduce the total cost and carbon dioxide emissions of the model. The optimal component capacity is also considered at the same time. A Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based optimization algorithm is then developed to achieve highly efficient operation, thus contributing to the reduction of the two objectives. As a result, in a compromise between the two conflicting objectives, the MPC algorithm successfully reduces operation costs by 44.4% and carbon dioxide emissions by 54.7% compared to the original case.

These changes in the global energy situation have increased the importance of research on energy management methods in the power grid. In particular, Demand Side Management (DSM) at consumers is attracting worldwide attention [27,19,7,23]. According to a recent survey, due to COVID-19, people are spending 90% of their time inside buildings such as houses [6]. Therefore, if consumers within a consumer\u2019s household are reluctant to engage in energy management, it can have a significant impact on their energy consumption [14,3]. However, minimizing energy consumption in homes is not an easy task, and Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS) have been developed to address these issues, and optimal scheduling of home appliances is being considered [13]. For environmental conservation, it is important to approach the issue not only from the power supply side but also from the consumer side, and intelligent systems such as Smart Houses (SH) have been proposed. Generally, Photovoltaic (PV), Heat Pump (HP) water heaters, and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) are installed in SH. By applying Time-of-Use (ToU) price and optimal scheduling provided by electricity suppliers, it is possible to reduce operation costs (electricity prices) at consumers [16,18]. In recent years, Fuel-cells (FC) have been developed that can supply both heat and electricity to consumers. FCs use city-gas to generate electricity, which can be used to supply power, and at the same time, the waste heat generated during power generation can be effectively used to generate thermal energy for water heating and heating. This is called a cogeneration system. In Japan, the electricity provided by power suppliers has an energy efficiency of about 40%, whereas integrating and operating FCs at consumers can increase energy efficiency to about 80%. Therefore, by utilizing these devices, consumers can significantly reduce their operating costs. It should be noted, however, that the initial cost per device is significant, especially for FC. Availability of the component to be installed is a factor that should be emphasized in any study of consumers. The simplest way to improve availability is to consider the optimal capacity of the component to be integrated into the consumer. Various goals can be achieved by changing the amount of component installed according to the needs of the consumer. For example, a consumer who is proactive about environmental conservation will install more distributed power sources that do not emit greenhouse gases than a normal consumer. Furthermore, the introduction of large-capacity BESS can reduce, in the extreme, greenhouse gas emissions. However, as mentioned above, in order to install the component, the consumer must pay the initial cost. Therefore, consumers who value the economics of the system are not willing to install these devices. In light of the above, it is very important to rigorously consider the capacity of the facilities to be installed in DSM, and it is necessary to conduct a study that can meet the demands of various consumers. Current research on DSM emphasizes the consideration of optimal scheduling of controllable loads. In particular, Model Predictive Control (MPC) [15] is known as a flexible approach. In [11], a household operation with intermittent Distributed Energy Resources (DER) and comprehensive loads is considered. The proposed model considers real-time tariffs and various uncertainties in order to present the most profitable and feasible strategy for the customer. A two-level economic MPC model is proposed to solve the multi-input, multi-output problem of this paper. In [28], an optimal scheduling method for energy systems in on-grid buildings under a time-responsive electricity rate structure is studied. In this paper, an MPC strategy using a non-linear programming algorithm is developed and applied to the scheduling problem. In [9], a hybrid MPC strategy is proposed to maintain the room temperature of the smart house within a specified range, while at the same time storing electricity and heat and reducing the amount of electricity purchased from the power grid. In [21], the focus is devoted to energy displacement applied to space heating in smart buildings. It combines space heating sources, electric radiators and Combined Heat and Power (CHP) units, and formulates the MPC problem to achieve a reduction in operating costs. In [17], an approximate linear economic MPC for a building HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) system is proposed while at the same time considering DERs such as inflexible loads, PV generation, and BESS. In [5], the MPC algorithm incorporates a learning-based modeling approach to manage the thermal characteristics of a multi-zone building; to feed data to the MPC, an artificial neural network creates a predictive profile of the occupants, and using this data the MPC algorithm uses each time step to generate optimal setpoints as control inputs to improve system performance. In [24], a demand response scheme based on active demand participation from smart buildings is proposed and MPC-based algorithms are developed. It schedules the usage of HVAC systems and batteries to reduce energy costs. In [2], a robust energy management system for multi-carrier microgrids, including both electrical and thermal component, is addressed. In addition, a robust MPC algorithm is developed that combines the MPC algorithm with robust optimization to provide improved performance over previous algorithms. In addition, although the price of PV and BESS has been decreasing year by year, the current situation has not changed, which is a significant burden when installing on the demand side, and it is an essential issue to consider component capacity. Therefore, the study of component capacity on the demand side has also been done in many literatures. In [25], a residential PV panel planning framework based on a two-stage game theory is proposed for a distribution grid with PV consumers. In the first stage, a stochastic bilevel energy sharing model based on the Stackelberg game is developed to determine the optimal PV panel capacity under uncertainties in PV output, load demand, and electricity prices. In the second phase, we propose a residential PV panel deployment model for all PV prosumers based on stochastic programming. In [20], the optimal capacity of PV and batteries in an off-grid SH system is studied. It is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem to evaluate capacity and operation, and the compromised solutions are compared for different case studies. In [8], both controllable power devices and energy storage devices are introduced into the system to provide the minimum storage capacity needed for the power system. In [12], an optimization algorithm is used to find the battery capacity that maximizes the net present value (NPV) given the price of the battery and the area of the PV panels. A method for estimating battery aging is incorporated to determine its impact on the economics of residential energy systems, suggesting the possibility of discontinuities in the valuation function. In [29], the sizing of PV systems and BESSs in households considering a tiered electricity pricing scheme (SPT) is considered, and to optimize the capacity attack, PV output uncertainty, seasonal load profiles, and subsidies for PV are considered in a mixed integer nonlinear programming framework expressed in A HEMS is proposed. In [26], an expansion planning model for PV and battery systems for smart houses is proposed: the cost of PV and batteries is decreasing year by year, but so is the price of electricity sold through the feed-in tariff (FIT). Therefore, the paper clarifies in which year and at what capacity installation is the best choice for consumers. However, few references such as these evaluate both optimal component capacity and more practical methods of operation. This paper examines both advanced load scheduling and optimal component capacity. The economic efficiency of the installed components is evaluated by considering these two factors simultaneously. Considering only one of the two factors, optimal component capacity or high-efficiency operation, will result in a gap in terms of economics. As a result, consumers are overburdened, and reducing the burden on the demand side is the most important issue for DSM. The simultaneous study of optimal component capacity and high-efficiency operation proposed in this paper helps to fill this research gap. The problem of optimizing component capacity is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem, where component capacity is proposed according to the demands of the consumers. With respect to optimal scheduling, an MPC-based optimization algorithm will be developed. This algorithm will allow for an evaluation of the optimal component capacity determined, while at the same time minimizing the operation costs for Smart Apartment Building (SAB) through intelligent scheduling. The contributions of this paper are as follows. \u2022 Study of optimal component capacity on the demand side: most of the literature considers the optimal scheduling of load for the demand side, but not up to the component capacity. Therefore, this paper examines the optimal component capacity on the demand side and proposes an operational method to meet the demand side requirements. \u2022 Evaluation of optimal component capacity by multi-objective optimization: in this paper, the optimal component capacity is determined under various conditions by multi-objective optimization, where the first objective function is minimization of total cost and the second objective function is minimization of CO2 emissions. This allows consumers to determine component capacity according to their own lifestyles and preferences. \u2022 Develop MPC-based optimization algorithm: investigate optimal scheduling methods for controllable loads using the determined optimal capacity. This will allow us to evaluate the optimal capacity and at the same time propose practical operational methods. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the multi-objective optimization performed in this paper. Section 3 describes the home energy management system configuration. Section 4 describes the optimization problem formulation and applies the MPC-based optimization algorithm. Section 5 discusses the results of numerical experiments and Section 6 concludes the paper. 2 Optimization problem formulation 2.1 Multi-objective optimization This paper determines the optimal component capacity to be installed in order to achieve the two objectives of minimizing the total cost to the consumer and minimizing carbon dioxide emissions. These two objectives are a trade-off, so a Pareto front can be created. For example, if environmental considerations are important, PV that does not emit carbon dioxide should be installed to the maximum extent possible.In addition, BESS will be installed in proportion to PV capacity for the purpose of improving PV output utilization. While this will achieve one of the goals, i.e., reducing carbon dioxide emissions, the total cost of the system will be higher due to increased component costs. By using this feature to create a Pareto front, it is possible to propose various operational methods according to the needs of the consumer. In this paper, the ε -constraint method is adopted as an approach to achieve multi-objective optimization. The ε -constraint method can transform a multi-objective optimization problem into a single-objective optimization problem by setting one of the objectives as the objective function and treating the other objectives as constraints when there are multiple objectives to minimize (maximize). In this paper, total consumer cost is set as the objective function and carbon dioxide emissions as the constraint, and a Pareto front is created by gradually changing the threshold of the constraint. The general multi-objective problem is formulated as follows. (1) max ( f 1 ( x ) , f 2 ( x ) , f 3 ( x ) , \u2026 , f n ( x ) ) Applying the ε -constraint method, Eq. (1) can be converted, (2) max f 1 ( x ) subjectto f i ( x ) ⩽ ε i i = 2 , 3 , \u2026 , p . 2.2 Home energy management system In HEMS, electricity is supplied by the power grid and distributed power sources, gas by the gas utility, and heat by on-board FC. With respect to heat demand, this paper considers hot water use, with hot water used in the morning and evening. The Thermal Energy Storage System (TESS) is modeled as a hot water storage tank, and the water in the tank is heated using the waste heat from the FC. In addition, unit prices for electricity and gas are shown in Table 1, 2 . The following sections describe the modeling and energy management strategies for the component installed in the consumer. 2.2.1 Smart apartment building model The SAB assumed in this paper is shown in Fig. 1 . In the system, PV, FC, and BESS are installed. FC and BESS are controllable loads, and the operation method is determined by an optimization problem that minimizes the total system cost. The operating costs of the system and the initial cost of the component are calculated as follows: (3) Cost day = ∑ t = 1 T ( Cost ele ( t ) + Cost gas ( t ) ) + Cost ini (4) Cost ele ( t ) = c ele pur · P pur ( t ) - c ele sell · P sell ( t ) (5) Cost gas ( t ) = c gas pur · A gas (6) Cost ini = c PV · Cap PV + c BESS · Cap BESS where Cost day is the total cost per day for the customer, Cost ele ( t ) is the total amount paid for electricity, Cost gas ( t ) is the total amount paid for gas, Cost ini ( t ) is the converted component initial cost, c pur / c sell is the coefficient of buying/ sold coefficient, P pur ( t ) / P sell ( t ) is the amount of electricity bought/sold, c gas is the gas unit cost coefficient, A gas is the amount of gas consumed, c PV / c BESS is the PV/BESS cost coefficient, Cap PV / Cap BESS is the component capacity of PV/BESS. In addition, the carbon dioxide emissions of consumers are calculated as follows: (7) CO 2 day = c ele CO 2 ∑ t = 1 T P pur ( t ) + c gas CO 2 ∑ t = 1 T A gas where c ele CO 2 is the carbon dioxide emission factor for electricity purchased and c gas CO 2 is the carbon dioxide emission factor for gas purchased. The system must also be balanced between supply and demand of electricity, and the balancing equation is expressed as follows: (8) P grid ( t ) + P BESS ( t ) + ∑ n = 1 N FC P n FC ( t ) = P load ( t ) - P PV ( t ) (9) P grid ( t ) = P pur ( t ) - P sell ( t ) (10) P BESS ( t ) = P dis ( t ) - P cha ( t ) where P grid ( t ) denotes the power current at the point of connection between the system and the power grid, P BESS ( t ) denotes the charging/discharging power of the BESS, P n FC ( t ) denotes the FC single unit output, P load ( t ) denotes the load excluding controllable load, P PV ( t ) denotes PV output, P dis ( t ) / P cha ( t ) is the BESS discharging/charging power. The power flow at the point of interconnection between the system and the power grid has a maximum fluctuation limit for the power flow of the previous time step. The limits of the power flow variation are expressed as follows [1]: (11) | P grid ( t - 1 ) - P grid ( t ) | ⩽ Δ P grid where Δ P gird denotes the maximum fluctuation range of the power flow. Purchasing and selling power cannot be executed simultaneously in the system. Therefore, the following is expressed using a binary variable that controls the purchasing and selling of electricity [1]: (12) 0 ⩽ P pur ( t ) ⩽ PF max · α (13) 0 ⩽ P sell ( t ) ⩽ PF max · ( 1 - α ) where PF max denotes the maximum power tidal flow and α denotes the sell/buy power control variable. The system purchases power from the grid when α = 1 and sells power to the power grid when α = 0 . 2.2.2 Photovoltaic The PV in the system is assumed to have a conversion efficiency η PV , number of panels n PV , and panel area S PV . In addition, the PV power P PV obtained from solar radiation is calculated from the equation defined below [26]. Note that this paper focuses on Okinawa, Japan, and uses solar radiation data for the region of interest. (14) P PV = η PV n PV S PV I PV ( 1 - 0.005 ( Temp out - 25 ) ) where I PV denotes solar radiation and Temp out denotes outdoor temperature. 2.2.3 Battery energy storage system This paper assumes that BESS is installed in the system. The State of Charge (SOC) of the BESS is expressed as follows and is limited within the upper and lower limits of capacity from the viewpoint of suppressing BESS degradation [10]: (15) SOC ( t ) = SOC ( t - 1 ) + P cha ( t ) · η BESS - P dis ( t ) / η BESS (16) SOC min ⩽ SOC ( t ) ⩽ SOC max where SOC ( t ) is the SOC of the BESS, η BESS is the discharging/charging efficiency of the BESS, SOC min is the minimum capacity of the BESS ( = 0.2 Cap BESS ) and SOC max is the maximum capacity of the BESS ( = 0.9 Cap BESS ). In addition, the charging and discharging of the BESS cannot be done simultaneously, and by using a binary variable that controls charging and discharging, it is expressed as follows [1]: (17) 0 ⩽ P cha ( t ) ⩽ Cha max · β (18) 0 ⩽ P dis ( t ) ⩽ Dis max · ( 1 - β ) where Cha max denotes the maximum charge power of the BESS, Dis max denotes the maximum discharge power of the BESS, and β denotes the charge/discharge control variable of the BES; the BESS charges electrical energy to the BESS when β = 1 and discharges BESS discharges electric energy from BESS when β = 0 . 2.2.4 Fuel-cell model The system is equipped with FCs, which are CHP units capable of generating thermal and electrical energy using city gas provided by the gas supplier. This section provides formulations for FCs. Typically, a minimum operating time and minimum shutdown time are established for the FC, and the time of use and rest time of the FC must be taken into account. Running/stopping time is limited to the following: (19) T FC run ( t ) ⩾ T min FC (20) T FC stop ( t ) ⩾ T min FC where T FC run ( t ) denotes the continuous operating time of FC, T FC stop ( t ) denotes the continuous rest time of FC, and T min FC denotes the minimum running/stopping time of FC. In addition, FCs have a minimum/maximum electrical output and must be operated within the upper and lower limits of the FC\u2019s power output. the limits of the FC\u2019s power output are expressed as follows: (21) P min FC · v FC ⩽ P FC ( t ) ⩽ P max FC · v FC where P min FC denotes the minimum power output of FC, P max FC the maximum power output of FC, and v FC the inactive state of FC. With respect to the minimum power output of FCs, the efficiency of FCs becomes extremely low when operated at low output. Therefore, in order to maintain some efficiency, the minimum power output is set at 50% of the maximum power output. Also, v FC is a binary variable that controls the operating/stopped state of the FC. When v FC = 1 , the FC is in the operating state, and when v FC = 0 , the FC is stopped. 2.2.5 Hot water supply system The hot water supply system proposed in this paper adjusts the hot water in the storage tank by diluting it with cold water and supplies it to each consumer. The water temperature in the hot water storage tank must be maintained at or above the specified water temperature to ensure occupant comfort. Therefore, before using hot water, the water is heated by a heat source to raise the water temperature. Also in this paper, the TESS is modeled as a hot water storage tank and the water heating system is represented as follows [22]: (22) Q FC + Q sity - Q sup - Q loss = c wa ρ wa V tank γ dTemp tank dt (23) Q sup = c wa ρ wa γ V sup ( Temp tank - Temp sta ) (24) Q sity = c wa ρ wa γ V sity ( Temp wa - Temp sta ) (25) V sup = V sity = Temp load - Temp wa Temp tank - T wa V load (26) Q loss = δ htc ( Temp tank - Temp out ) where c wa is the specific heat of water, ρ wa is the density of water, V tank is the capacity of the hot water storage tank, γ is the unit conversion parameter, and Temp tank is the water temperature in the storage tank. Q FC denotes the heat energy added from the FC, Q sup denotes the heat energy taken out of the tank during water heating, and Q sity denotes the heat energy supplied from the city water. V sup indicates the amount of water used from the hot water storage tank, V sity indicates the amount of water supplied from city water, and V load indicates the actual amount of water supplied from the hot water storage tank. Temp load indicates the water temperature used by the heat load, Temp wa indicates the water temperature supplied by the hot water storage tank, Temp tank indicates the water temperature in the storage tank, and Temp sta indicates the reference temperature. Q loss is the heat loss due to the temperature difference between the water temperature in the hot water storage tank and the outside air temperature, and δ htc is the heat transfer coefficient. In this system, the heat source is considered to be the FC; the relationship between the electrical and thermal energy of the FC is expressed as follows: (27) Q FC = η FC P FC where η FC denotes the heat recovery efficiency of FC. The water temperature in the tank must remain above the temperature set for occupant comfort. The water temperature constraint is expressed as follows: (28) Temp tank ( t ) ⩾ Temp tar 2.3 Optimal scheduling problem In this section, we formulate the consumer scheduling optimization problem. The following sections describe the optimization problem applying the MPC algorithm and the optimization problem applying the conventional algorithm. This paper deals with a multi-objective optimization problem that minimizes two optimization objectives simultaneously. The first and second objective functions are shown below. The 1st objective function (Total cost): (29) Min Cost day The 2nd objective function (CO 2 emission): (30) Min CO 2 day The ε -constraint method sets one of these two objective functions as the objective function and the other as the constraint. In this paper, minimization of operating costs is set as the objective function and carbon dioxide emissions as the constraint. Reformulating the carbon dioxide emissions minimization as a constraint, we obtain: (31) c ele CO 2 ∑ t = 1 T P pur ( t ) + c gas CO 2 ∑ t = 1 T A gas ⩽ CO 2 max where CO 2 max denotes the maximum carbon dioxide emissions. 2.3.1 MPC-based optimization algorithm When applying the MPC algorithm, the optimization algorithm is executed in [ k , k + H ] time horizons when the control horizon is k and the prediction horizon is H. Thus, the MPC-based optimization algorithm minimizes the total energy cost within the time horizon. The optimization problem is formulated as follows: Min ∑ k k + H Cost day subject to ( 8 ) , ( 11 ) ∼ ( 13 ) , ( 15 ) ∼ ( 21 ) , ( 28 ) , ( 31 ) 2.3.2 Traditional optimization algorithm The traditional algorithm repeats the optimization for each day for the number of days in the simulation horizon. Applying the conventional algorithm optimizes the daily load schedule and minimizes the total operation cost for a total of one year. The optimization problem is formulated as follows: Min Cost day subjectto ( 8 ) , ( 11 ) ∼ ( 13 ) , ( 15 ) ∼ ( 21 ) , ( 28 ) , ( 31 ) 3 Numerical experiment In this paper, simulations are performed in four stages and the final determined component capacity is used for optimal scheduling. The flowchart of the optimization process is shown in Fig. 2 . The SAB model in this paper includes 16 SHs and considers 9 load patterns. The load patterns are shown in Fig. 3 , where the SHs differ in number of persons and peak load. The details of each SH are shown in Table 3 . The data input in the optimization flow is shown in Fig. 4 . In Stage 1, single objective optimization is performed to minimize operation cost and component cost. The carbon dioxide emissions are then calculated from the amount of electricity purchased by the system. In Stage 2, single objective optimization is performed to minimize carbon dioxide emissions. At this time, the minimized carbon dioxide emissions are recorded. In Stage 3, the difference in carbon dioxide emissions calculated in Stages 1 and 2 is divided by an arbitrary number to create multiple constraint conditions. In this paper, the values are divided into 10 parts and 10 patterns of constraint conditions are created. In Stage 4, the constraints formulated in Stage 3 are incorporated into the optimal scheduling problem to generate a Pareto front. Several proposed optimization algorithms are then applied for optimal scheduling of controllable loads in the system. In the optimization flow described above, only the PV and BESS component capacities are considered. Since FCs are on-board, this paper analyzes the impact of varying the number of FCs on the operation cost and carbon dioxide emissions when determining the optimal scheduling. FC specifications are shown in Table 4 , with the number of FCs varying from 2 to 5. The component capacity determined will be compared to that of a traditional apartment complex and an analysis is made regarding the adequacy of the investment cost. The optimization problem is implemented in MATLAB R2020b on a desktop PC i9-10980XE 64 GB RAM and is mathematically modeled as the Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem and solved using the MILP solver in the MATLAB toolbox. 3.1 Determination of optimal component capacity In this paper, a multi-objective optimization is performed with the objective set to minimize the total cost and carbon footprint of the system. The resulting Pareto front and the PV and BESS capacities for each solution are shown in Fig. 5 . The numbering of each Pareto solution and the total cost, operation cost, and carbon dioxide emissions and corresponding values on the right side of Eq. (31) are also shown in the Table 5 . Where solution 1 is the most proactive customer in reducing environmental impact, and solution 10 is the most economical customer. Also, solution 0 assumes a traditional consumer, whose electrical and thermal energy requirements are satisfied by grid electricity and gas boilers. From Fig. 5, it is possible to determine the component capacity depending on which is more important to the consumer, cost or carbon dioxide emissions. In demand-side management, it is important to offer flexible system operation to customers. By considering component capacity in this way, it is possible to make proposals that are in line with the preferences of consumers. Table 5 shows that consumers with the greatest concern for the environment are more aggressive in introducing distributed power sources, resulting in higher component costs. On the other hand, consumers with the greatest emphasis on economic efficiency are reluctant to install distributed power sources, resulting in lower facility costs. Thus, there is a difference in component cost depending on which of the two objectives is more important. It should also be mentioned that the installation of PV and BESS reduces operation costs. The reduced costs can be used to pay for component costs, and the number of years it takes to do so can guide whether or not component is installed. This is discussed in a later section. This paper describes the operational results of Solution 5, which is a compromise between the two objectives of minimizing total cost and minimizing carbon emissions. Therefore, the optimal component capacity for PV and BESS in this paper is 22.4 kW and 21.2 kWh, respectively. 3.2 Optimal scheduling of solution 5 In this section, the PV and BESS component capacities determined in the previous section are used to determine the optimal scheduling of the SAB. Traditional method is used for the optimization algorithm, and the simulation horizon is set to one year. The control horizon is one day, and optimal scheduling is performed to minimize operation cost. and the optimal scheduling results are shown in Fig. 6 , the scheduling results are shown in Fig. 7 . In this section, three FCs are deployed in the SAB, and the running/stopping status of all FCs can be seen in Fig. 7(a). With regard to FC operation, the assumed SAB has only FC as the heat output device, so the heat output is more important than the power output. Therefore, it can be seen from Fig. 7(b) that the water temperature in the tank attached to the FC is operated so that the FC does not fall below the target temperature set in the previous section. At the same time, electrical energy can be supplied at the same time, which helps to reduce operation costs compared to the conventional gas boiler-based solution0. It can also be verified that the constraints set in the previous section regarding FC output and running/stopping time are also satisfied. Fig. 7(c) shows the operation results for the SAB. Optimal scheduling must take into account the power balance of the consumer. Therefore, as a basic operation, the power consumption required by non-controllable loads is satisfied by PV output, FC output, grid power, and BESS discharge. When PV output is high and there is surplus power, it is charged to BESS or sold to the grid to maintain the power balance. In order to make effective use of the energy produced, surplus power is basically recharged to the BESS and sold to the grid when it exceeds the recharging capacity. This can be seen in Figs. 7(c) and (d). This component configuration and optimal scheduling have resulted in cost reductions and reduced environmental impact. 3.3 Investigate the number of FC In this paper, after determining the optimal component capacity for PV and BESS, the optimal number of FC units is examined. The FC units shown in Table 4 are varied from 2\u20135 units and introduced into the SAB. The Pareto front generated by this change in the number of FC units is shown in Fig. 8 . Fig. 8 shows that there is a difference in total cost and carbon dioxide emissions between two and three FCs when optimal scheduling is performed, but there is almost no difference between three and five FCs, indicating that there is no need to install more than four FCs. It is found that reducing the number of FC units has an impact on the overall cost performance. As discussed in the previous section, the reduced costs must be used to pay for the component. Years to pay is an important factor in component installation, which is illustrated in Fig. 9 . All installed PV, BESS and FC are assumed to be available for 15 years. From Fig. 9, it can be seen that if four or more FCs are used, it will take more than 15 years to pay off the component costs, so it is better to consider 2\u20133 units. Furthermore, since two FCs can be operated, the optimal number of component units is concluded to be two, taking into account the years required for payment. 3.4 Optimal scheduling with MPC algorithm The MPC algorithm has been considered in various studies as a means of achieving highly efficient optimal scheduling. This paper also develops an MPC-based optimization algorithm and applies it to the optimal scheduling of SAB. In this section, three case studies are discussed. Case A. Traditional consumer In this case, no distributed generation is installed at the consumer. Therefore, electricity is supplied by the electricity grid and gas is supplied by the gas utility. All consumer loads are non-controllable loads, and all necessary electrical energy is purchased from the power grid, while heat energy is supplied from a gas boiler using the purchased gas. Case B. SAB with traditional algorithm In this case, PV, BESS, and FC are installed in SAB; BESS and FC are controllable loads and determine optimal scheduling. Electrical energy is supplied by the power grid, PV, BESS and FC, and thermal energy is supplied by FC. Traditional algorithms are applied in determining the optimal scheduling, and optimization is performed one day at a time, finally simulating one year. Case C. SAB with MPC algorithm In this case, the same facilities are installed as in Case B. BESS and FC are controllable loads and optimal scheduling is determined. The MPC-based optimization algorithm is applied to determine the optimal scheduling, where the MPC algorithm determines the optimal scheduling with a predictive horizon of 3 days and a control horizon of 1 day. Simulations are run for one year. 3.4.1 Investigate operation cost and CO2 emissions The operation costs and carbon emissions for the three case studies are shown in Table 6 . Table 1 shows that Case C with the MPC algorithm reduces operation costs and carbon dioxide emissions by 44.4% and 54.7%, respectively, compared to Case A. Compared to Case B, it reduces operation cost by 34.6% and carbon dioxide emissions by 50.2%. The results show that the application of the MPC algorithm provides economic and environmental benefits. It is also noteworthy that the results show a reduction in operation costs. This is due to reduced purchases from the grid. The reduction in the amount purchased from the grid is achieved through the highly efficient operation of the installed PV, BESS, FC, and other distributed generation sources. The following sections discuss Case B and Case C operations. 3.4.2 Optimal scheduling results This section compare and discuss the operational results of Case B and Case C. Case B is the SAB with the traditional algorithm applied, and its operation results are shown in Fig. 10 . Fig. 10(a) shows the scheduling results for the installed FCs: one FC unit operates in the morning on day 1 and from day 2 to day 3. In addition, two units run from day 1 to day 2, and another two units run during the nighttime on day 3. During the daytime hours, the FC is not running because there is no heat demand. Fig. 10(b) shows the water temperature in the tank attached to the FC, and the FC is scheduled to stay below the set target temperature. There are times when the water temperature in the tank is rapidly decreasing, and warm water is used at this time. Fig. 10(c) shows the optimal scheduling results for the SAB: the daytime power requirements are satisfied on days 1 and 2 due to the high PV output. On day 1, the PV surplus power generated during the day is charged to BESS or sold to the power grid; on day 2, everything is charged to BESS; on day 3, the PV output is so small that grid power is purchased to cover the shortfall. As mentioned above, the FC is activated near the time of day when the water temperature in the tank attached to the FC is at the target temperature to be maintained, and the heat demand is generated. During the time of day when the load on the SAB is greater, the power requirements are satisfied by grid power, FC and BESS discharges. Fig. 1(d) shows the SOC of the BESS: on days 1 and 2, the initial SOC value is 20%, and the BESS is charged using the PV surplus power and discharged during the evening and night when the required power consumption is higher; on day 3, the PV output is so small that the BESS cannot be charged and remains constant at the lowest value. Next, to illustrate Case C, the operational results are shown in Fig. 11 . Fig. 11(a) shows the FC scheduling results. FC is basically operating during the evening and morning hours; FC is shut down because there is no heat demand during the hours when PV output is available. Unlike Case B, the two FC units are not operating at the same time. Nevertheless, Fig. 11(b) shows that the water temperature in the tank remains above the target temperature. Fig. 11(c) shows the optimal scheduling results for SAB. In this case, as in Case B, the daytime power requirements are satisfied because of the large PV output on days 1 and 2. On day 1, the PV surplus power generated during the day is charged to BESS or sold to the power grid; on day 2, everything is charged to BESS; on day 3, the electrical energy charged to BESS on the previous day is discharged in the evening, which is different from Case B. This is done to reduce purchases from the grid, given the small PV output on day 3 in advance. Therefore, from Fig. 11(d), which shows the SOC of the BESS, it can be seen that the charged electrical energy of the BESS is not used up, but is left over to use the energy the next day. This type of scheduling of charging and discharging is an operation not seen in Case B. The above simulation results show that the MPC algorithm considers future data, thus achieving a more efficient method of operation. The different operations for Case B and Case C are as follows: \u2022 By taking future data into account, FCs can operate at higher efficiency and the number of units operating simultaneously has been reduced. Nevertheless, the water temperature in the tank is maintained above the set target temperature. \u2022 The operation plan for controllable loads has been modified to take into account the small PV output in advance. In particular, BESS leaves some of the charged energy for use the next day, contributing to a reduction in the amount of energy purchased from the grid the next day. While traditional algorithms aim to reduce operational costs on a given day when the simulation is run, MPC-based algorithms also aim to reduce costs incurred in the future. This allows for highly efficient operations, resulting in lower operation costs and carbon emissions. 4 Conclusion In this paper, we proposed a SAB model in which multiple distributed power sources are shared by multiple consumers and dealt with a multi-objective optimization problem aimed at reducing the total cost and carbon footprint of the model. The ε -constraint method is employed as a means to replace the multi-objective optimization problem with a single-objective optimization problem, and at the same time, the optimal component capacity is considered. The Pareto front can be formed and operational methods can be implemented to meet various requirements, providing consumers with many options. In addition, an MPC-based optimization algorithm is developed as a means of reducing operation costs and carbon emissions. This paper compares three case studies: a case in which component capacity is considered, a case in which MPC algorithm was used after component capacity is considered, and the original case. As a result, Case B, in which component capacity is considered, reduced operation cost by 34.6% and carbon dioxide emissions by 50.2%. Case C, which considered component capacity and implemented the MPC algorithm, reduced operation costs by 44.4% and carbon dioxide emissions by 54.7%. A future challenge is dealing with uncertainty. This system has the challenge of dealing with uncertainty when it arises, and the use of methods such as robust optimization to deal with uncertainty is something that needs to be addressed.

        "dc:description": "Changes in the global energy landscape have increased the importance of research on energy management methods in the power grid. In particular, Demand Side Management (DSM) at consumers is attracting worldwide attention. Distributed generation in intelligent consumers, such as Smart Houses (SH), contributes to the introduction of new distributed generation from the demand side by determining optimal scheduling. However, Fuel-cells (FC) and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) are expensive, and their installation is a significant burden for the demand side. Therefore, this paper proposes a Smart Apartment Building (SAB) model in which multiple distributed power sources are shared by multiple consumers to reduce operation costs and carbon emissions through the implementation of highly efficient operation methods. An important aspect of such a study is to understand the characteristics of the demand side and to propose an operating method that takes into account the preferences of the demand side. In this paper, to provide a variety of options, a Pareto front is generated through multi-objective optimization to reduce the total cost and carbon dioxide emissions of the model. The optimal component capacity is also considered at the same time. A Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based optimization algorithm is then developed to achieve highly efficient operation, thus contributing to the reduction of the two objectives. As a result, in a compromise between the two conflicting objectives, the MPC algorithm successfully reduces operation costs by 44.4% and carbon dioxide emissions by 54.7% compared to the original case.",
