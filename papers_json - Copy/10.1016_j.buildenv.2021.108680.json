Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Institute, Tsinghua University Shenzhen 518055 PR China Energy consumption for heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) has increased significantly and accounted for a large proportion of building energy growth. Advanced control strategies are needed to reduce energy consumption with maintaining occupant thermal comfort. While compared to other control problems, HVAC control is faced with numerous restrictions from real building environments. One key restriction is non-stationarity, i.e., the varying HVAC system dynamics. Researchers have paid efforts to solve the non-stationarity problems through different approaches, among which deep reinforcement learning gains traction for its advantages in capturing real-time information, controlling adaptively to system feedbacks, avoiding tedious modeling works and combining with deep learning techniques. However, current researches solved non-stationarity in a passive manner which hinders its potential and adds instability in real application. To fill this research gap, we propose a novel HVAC control method combining active building environment change detection and deep Q network (DQN), named non-stationary DQN. This method aims to disentangle the non-stationarity by actively identifying the change points of building environments and learning effective control strategies for corresponding building environments. The simulation results demonstrate that this developed non-stationary DQN method outperforms the state-of-art DQN method in both single-zone control and multi-zone control tasks by saving unnecessary energy use and reducing thermal violation caused by non-stationarity. The improvement can reach 13% in energy-saving and 9% in thermal comfort. Besides, according to the results, our proposed method obtains stability against disturbance and generalization to an unseen building environment, which shows its robustness and potential in real-life applications.

Building consumption has made up 40% of contribution to global primary energy and 30% to C O 2 emissions [1]. Among all the building services, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system has greatly increased figures in energy use growth. It accounts for 50% of building consumption and 20% of total consumption in energy use growth in USA [2]. Therefore, improving the efficiency of HVAC systems under the guarantee of occupant thermal comfort can greatly benefit energy saving and carbon reduction. However, compared to other control problems, HVAC control is more difficult in finding the optimal control policies. One of the vital difficulties is the non-stationary building environments. For problem simplification, most works assume that control systems are stationary in an infinite time horizon, which means the building environments will evolve into the same future states if the current states and control actions are the same. However, the HVAC systems in the real life are highly non-stationary. A recent study [3] clarified that some buildings show non-stationary electrical temporal features caused by endogenous factors (eg., activities) or exogenous factors (eg. weather conditions). [4] pointed out that the whole building life cycle can be influenced by non-stationary climate. To be more concrete, the system dynamics (e.g., thermal model) can evolve into a different stage periodically: the building environments can change monthly for operation schedules, seasonally for weather conditions, or yearly for equipment aging. In addition, emergencies like sudden occupant increases can also degrade the control effectiveness. Therefore, non-stationarity has gained traction in recent studies. [5] proposed to capture the casual relations on non-stationary sensor data collected in smart buildings using a statistic time series analysis. [6] improved the prediction accuracy of HVAC energy consumption by considering non-stationary patterns. In HVAC control researches, efforts have been paid to mainly 3 approaches: rule-based control (RBC) methods, model predictive control (MPC) and reinforcement learning (RL) [7]. RBC methods are widely used in HVAC systems, which adopt a set of artificial rules designed by expert experience [8\u201311]. For non-stationary environments, seasonal climate changes (e.g. temperature variations) are considered in control rules for more comfortable indoor environments [12]. Besides, data-driven methods are also employed to design the setpoint of the air-conditioning system under different human activity levels [13] and benchmark the energy performance [14]. However, as HVAC systems and building environments are becoming more complicated, it will cost endless efforts to cover all the possible situations in control rules. Besides, artificial rules lack the flexibility to capture the evolving HVAC system information in real time. Model predictive control (MPC) is more promising in HVAC control for its capability of exploiting predictive information and making decisions adaptively [15,16]. MPC is based on a rigorous HVAC system model including building structures and HVAC schematics, and optimizes control strategies by predictions of system future evolution. The modeling methods can be categorized into 3 kinds: the white-box model developed by physical laws, the black-box model based on data-driven methods, and the gray-box model fitting load data into a physical model [17]. To overcome non-stationarity, MPC takes the nonlinear dynamics, the time-varying system dynamics and the time-varying disturbances into the consideration of modeling [18]. Variants of MPC such as robust MPC (RMPC) and stochastic MPC (SMPC) are employed to solve the uncertainty caused by non-stationarity [19]. [20] proposed an SMPC design methodology which can minimize the expected energy cost and maintain comfort using uncertain prediction of weather conditions and building loads. In [21], the authors presented that their scenario-based MPC capturing building dynamics outperformed vanilla MPC methods in robustness and energy efficiency. However, MPC highly depends on the accuracy of the system models. Model errors might prevent a designed MPC controller from real applications. Besides, modeling is time-demanding and labor-expensive. Furthermore, it might be insufficient to model building dynamics with non-stationarity by first or second-order approximations widely used in current MPC methods [22]. Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved significant success in many areas from Go [23] to video games [24]. In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has gained traction in HVAC control researches. Compared to RBC and MPC, DRL exhibits advantages in learning from collected data for decision-making [7]. Besides, the latest developments in thriving deep learning can be combined with DRL to improve the model complexity and decision efficiency. DRL is a data-driven method which consists of model-based RL and model-free RL. Model-based RL employs models to accelerate the learning process, which is similar to MPC but less computationally expensive. Recently, [25] adopted Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to model the HVAC systems for DRL. In [26], the authors proposed to model the air-conditioning and room temperature by Bayesian Convolutional Neural Network (BCNN) to train an uncertainty-aware deep Q-learning agent. Related works on model-based RL have provided insights on solving the non-stationary. In [27], the authors claimed that DRL controllers can solve the non-stationarity by relearning the environment dynamics and the control models. However, relearning building environment models could be time-demanding and decrease the control efficiency. In addition, it did not provide a practical method for explicitly telling the differences between non-stationary building environments and the timings when the environment changes happen. While model-free RL learns optimal control policies by trial-and-error interactions with building environments without a model, which means it reduces tedious modeling works [7] and processes better scalability and generalization [28]. For air-conditioning, [28] showed that popular model-free RL algorithms can reliably maintain the temperature while reducing energy consumption by more than 13% compared to model-based methods. In [29], a model-free DRL-based algorithm was developed for controlling energy consumption and tenant thermal comfort with a co-simulation framework based on EnergyPlus [30] for DRL training and validation. In [31], the authors implemented an Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) based control method for a radiant heating system achieving considerable heat demand savings in an office building deployment. Moreover, in [32], model-free DRL is extended to multi-zone cases and achieves more than 56% energy cost reduction for 30 zones in commercial buildings. Literature has shown the significant potential of model-free DRL. As for non-stationarity, some researchers believe that model-free RL algorithms can passively adapt to the latest building environment by updating models with data newly collected. However, this assumption might only work theoretically or in idealized experiment environments where enough training time and data are given. [27] pointed out that the performance of the DRL controllers is degraded when the building environments evolve periodically. Besides, passive adaptation results in the fact that the RL controllers are tired of converging from one environment to another environment without explicitly learning optimal policies according to different situations. In a nutshell, non-stationary building environments are vital problems hindering the further development of HVAC control methods. While we find some limitations for solving the non-stationarity after investigating the existing literature. On the one hand, modeling non-stationarity in the building models might add complexity and decrease efficiency for the control policies. On the other hand, passive adaptation without modeling does not work for highly non-stationary building environments. To overcome these gaps, an active and practical environment change detection method is needed for model-free DRL to exploit the potential and ensure the robustness of DRL-based HVAC control methods. We formulate HVAC control as Markov decision process (MDP) in non-stationary environments and propose a new DRL-based method focusing on optimizing HVAC control strategies in non-stationary building environments. The main contributions of this study are summarized as follows: \u2022 We develop a novel method called non-stationary DQN. To our best knowledge, it is the first method to actively detect the dynamic changes of the building environments and exploit this information in HVAC control optimization. Meanwhile, it is a model-free DRL method which is time-saving and can avoid errors from inaccurate modeling. \u2022 We conduct a thorough simulation-based comparison between the proposed method and the state-of-art DQN method in both single-zone control and multi-zone control problems. Thermal comfort and energy consumption are adopted as key metrics to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in eliminating the effects of non-stationary environments. \u2022 We verify the stability by examining the restorability of the proposed method after extreme disturbance. In addition, we verify the generalization by testing the proposed method in an unseen building environment with stochastic operation schedules. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a review of reinforcement learning (RL) and RL algorithms in static and non-stationary environments, together with the concept of MDP in non-stationary environments. The formulation of the single-zone control and multi-zone control problems are presented in Section 3. In Section 4, two algorithms adopted in our proposed method, DQN and ODCP, are briefly introduced, followed by a detailed explanation of our proposed HVAC control method combining environment change detection and DRL. Section 5 discusses our simulation results and Section 6 concludes the paper and presents directions for future work. 2 RL model for non-stationary environments 2.1 Reinforcement learning Reinforcement learning is one of the machine learning methods, which learns to perform serial actions according to situations in order to maximize the reward signal by trial-and-error search [33]. Unlike supervised learning which learns from a training set of labeled examples, reinforcement learning learns from its own experience of interaction with all kinds of situations; in addition, reinforcement learning differs from unsupervised learning as it aims to maximize the reward signal rather than find the hidden structure of the data [33]. In recent decades, reinforcement learning has been proved effective in solving decision-making problems. Most of the reinforcement learning problems can be modeled in a mathematical form of the Markov decision process. In MDP, an agent learns and makes decisions; other things the agent interacts with are called environment [33]. For example, in a building, the agent can be a controller determining temperature setpoints, while the environment can be the combination of occupants, the HVAC system, weather, and so on. At decision epoch t , the agent chooses an action a t according to environment state s t . At the next epoch, the agent receives a reward r t and a new state s t + 1 (see the stationary case in Fig. 1). Thus, MDP can be represented by a tuple of 〈 S , A , P , R 〉 , where S and A are the state and action spaces. P : S × A × S → [ 0 , 1 ] is the transition probability function. It defines the probability distribution of next state s \u2032 at t + 1 the system evolves into, given the current state s and action a (see Eq. (1)). R : S × A → R is the reward function. It models the numerical reward yielded by applying action a to state s, i.e., R ∼ r ( s , a ) . (1) p ( s \u2032 | s , a ) = P r { s t + 1 = s \u2032 | s t = s , a t = a } Reinforcement learning algorithms can also be categorized into value-based methods (e.g., Q-learning) and policy-based methods (e.g. policy gradient). These algorithms have been combined with deep neural networks for more complicated control problems. 2.2 MDP and RL algorithms in non-stationary environments Technically speaking, the non-stationarity of the building environment mainly refers to the fact that the state transition probability P and reward function R are non-stationary. They are changing along with some internal or external factors. To be more concrete, even though the instant states (e.g., indoor air temperature) are similar in different periods, the building state evolutions can be different. It is insufficient to describe such a control problem as a stable MDP. Thus, [34] defined MDP in non-stationary environments as below: Given a family of MDPs { M θ } θ ∈ N + , where θ takes values from a finite index set Θ , M θ = 〈 S , A , P θ , R θ 〉 with the same state and action spaces and different transition probability distributions and reward functions. Each MDP in the family is called a context. We assume that only one context is active during a time interval (see Fig. 1). There will be a change point between two sequentially active contexts. For example, the environment may change from M θ 0 to M θ 1 at timestep T 1 . Thus, the non-stationary dynamics P , R will be: (2) P ( s t + 1 = s \u2032 | s t = s , a t = a ) = P θ 0 s \u2032 | s , a t < T 1 P θ 1 s \u2032 | s , a T 1 ≤ t < T 2 ⋮ and for s t = s , a t = a (3) R ( s , a ) = R θ 0 s , a t < T 1 R θ 1 s , a T 1 ≤ t < T 2 ⋮ Fig. 1 demonstrates the non-stationary case of environments in reinforcement learning. In the literature, there have been some pioneer works addressing RL in non-stationary environments. One approach aims to minimize the performance criterion called regret (see Eq. (4)), which refers to the difference between the expected optimal rewards collected over a finite horizon T from a start state s 0 , and those produced by the current policy. [35] proposed UCRL2 algorithm, a variant of Upper Confidence Reinforcement Learning (UCRL) proposed by [36]. UCRL2 adopts this approach and gives a sublinear regret upper bound by finding the optimal MDP from a set of plausible MDPs for the current environment and its corresponding optimal policy. A set of plausible MDPs is built by estimating the transition probability function and the reward function. UCRL2 restarts learning when it exceeds the diameter of the current MDP (see Eq. (5), where M is the environment context and T is the timestep of the first arrival of s \u2032 from s ), which however will discard all the former estimations. (4) Regret = V T ∗ ( s 0 ) − ∑ t = 0 T − 1 R ( s t , a t ) (5) D M = max s ≠ s \u2032 min π : S → A E T ( s \u2032 | s , π ) Another approach is to learn an optimal control policy for non-stationary environments by detecting the environmental changes. [37] proposed a context detection based algorithm called Reinforcement Learning with Context Detection (RL-CD). Similar to UCRL2, it statistically estimates the transition probability functions and the reward functions for a set of partial MDP models. It evaluates the quality of each partial model, that is, the difference between the current transition and reward and learned transition probability and reward functions. Then it updates the Q-values of the partial model with the highest quality. However, it is difficult to apply in complex control problems like HVAC control because high dimensional and continuous state variables are intractable for probability function estimation. A more efficient algorithm called Context QL is proposed by [34]. It addresses the context detection problems not by statistical estimation but by finding the change points of the state-reward tuples over a horizon T. Experience tuple ( s t , r t , s t + 1 ) consists of the current state, reward, and next state in an iteration. Non-stationary MDPs are modeled as the combination of piecewise MDP contexts as mentioned before. These RL algorithms have been proved effective in simple non-stationary control problems. 3 Problem formulation 3.1 A brief introduction of the non-stationary HVAC control problem In this work, we consider the HVAC system in a commercial building with 5 zones. The heating and cooling setpoints of the thermostat in each zone are controlled. The goal is to minimize the HVAC energy consumption and satisfy occupant thermal comfort in non-stationary building environments. We consider two problems for experiments, the single-zone control problem and the multi-zone control problem. The experiment settings are as follows: \u2022 The single-zone problem. Only one of the 5 zones (Zone 1) is controlled by the RL controller while the others are controlled by a default fixed schedule (see Fig. 3). Only Zone 1 needs to do the learning to investigate the performance of our proposed method in a single zone with relatively stable influence from other zones. \u2022 The multi-zone problem. All zones are controlled by the RL controllers, which is a distributed multi-agent control problem (see Fig. 2). We will train 5 agents respectively for 5 zones from the beginning to investigate the performance of our methods under varying interactions between different zones. Moreover, the state space differs from that of the single-zone problem (see Section 3.2.1). 3.2 Markov decision process formulation for HVAC control problem As mentioned in Section 2.1, the MDP formulation includes state space, action space and reward function. 3.2.1 State space The state is the input for the RL controller. In the single-zone problem, the state vector includes 15 variables as shown in Table 1. They can be categorized into 2 types: (a) system states denoting HVAC system dynamics, which can be changed by the RL controller\u2019s actions. Heating setpoint and cooling setpoint are included in system states because we use the increments to setpoints for control (see Section 3.2.2). (b) environment states, which do not change with the RL controller\u2019s actions but can influence HVAC system dynamics in some approaches (natural evolution, plans, etc.). The relationship between the 2 types of states is shown in Fig. 4. It is proper to model the HVAC problem as MDP with an extended state space for the RL controller. The state space of this MDP not only includes the HVAC dynamics S , but also includes the actions of the exogenous environment E . The transition function of a Markov decision process with exogenous variables is: P ( s \u2032 | s , a , e ) = P r { s t + 1 = s \u2032 | s t = s , a t = a , e t = e } where s ∈ S , e ∈ E . Moreover, the Bellman equation (Eq. (10)) for Q value update still holds if e , e \u2032 is given: Q ( s , a , e ) = r + γ max a Q ( s \u2032 , a \u2032 , e \u2032 ) As for the state space of the multi-zone problem, besides the above 15 state variables of the single-zone problem, the heating setpoint and cooling setpoint of the other 4 zones are also included. The action and state of other agents also influence the evolution of the building thermal dynamics. Thus, from the perspective of one agent, other agents are also a part of the environment and their actions or states can also provide extra information for the control policy. Moreover, the goal of the multi-zone problem is to minimize the total energy consumption and maintain thermal comfort for each zone. It becomes a more complex problem when the group behaviors of agents should be taken into consideration. The group behaviors of agents may also affect the non-stationarity of the building environment, which will be demonstrated in detail in Section 5.5. In order to facilitate the learning of the deep neural network, all the state variables are normalized into [0,1] by min\u2013max normalization (see Eq. (6)) (6) v n o r m = v − v m i n v m a x − v m i n where v is one of the state variables and v m a x and v m i n for each variable can be estimated from historical data. This is a widely used pre-processing skill for machine learning [38]. 3.2.2 Action space According to our experiments, DQN obtains better efficiency than other DRL algorithms. DQN requires discretized actions. For DQN, actions are more like options to choose from instead of variables. Given a state at time t , a DQN agent decides to take one of the options. The listed 4 tuples below are 4 options. It is similar to the options we take in a maze game where we choose to move up, move down, move left, or move right at a cross. A = { ( − 1 . 0 , − 1 . 0 ) , ( 1 . 0 , 1 . 0 ) , ( − 1 . 0 , 1 . 0 ) , ( 0 . 0 , 0 . 0 ) } For each action tuple, two numbers represent the increments to previous heating setpoint H t S p t and cooling setpoint C l S p t respectively. For example, if the RL agent chooses the first tuple as the action at time t , the heating setpoint and cooling setpoint at t + 1 will be lowered by 1 °C compared to those at t : H t S p t t + 1 = H t S p t t − 1 C l S p t t + 1 = C l S p t t − 1 Note that the action setting also ensures that the cooling setpoint is always not less than the heating setpoint. There is also an action value limit for heating and cooling setpoints: the heating setpoint should be not lower than 15 °C and the cooling setpoint should be not higher than 30 °C. 3.2.3 Reward function In our work, Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied (PPD) [39] is used as the thermal comfort metric. PPD is adopted as one of the thermal comfort indices by globally recognized ASHRAE 55 and ISO 7730 standards for evaluating indoor environments. PPD is calculated based on Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) (see Eq. (7)). PMV quantifies the thermal comfort by mathematical formula with multiple factors including metabolic rate, insulation, air temperature, airspeed, mean radiant temperature, and relative humidity. (7) P P D = 100 − 95 × exp { − 0 . 03353 × P M V 4 − 0 . 2179 × P M V 2 } In our paper, PPD can be obtained by EnergyPlus simulation. In addition, total HVAC electric power demand is used as the energy consumption metric. The details of the total HVAC electric power demand is introduced in Section 5.1. Considering both occupant thermal comfort and HVAC energy consumption, the reward function is shown in: (8) r ( t ) = − w e P H V A C ( t ) O c c u p = 0 − w e P H V A C ( t ) − w c C c o m f o r t ( t ) o t h e r w i s e In Eq. (8), w e , w c are the weights for the total HVAC electric demand power P H V A C ( t ) and the occupant thermal comfort cost C c o m f o r t ( t ) , O c c u p is the occupant status flag which equals to 0 when no people are in the controlled zone and equals to 1 as long as there is one person. Only when there are occupants, the thermal comfort cost will be considered in the optimization. C c o m f o r t ( t ) is calculated as follows: (9) C c o m f o r t ( t ) = 1 P P D > P P D t h r e s P P D o t h e r w i s e In Eq. (9), P P D t h r e s is the threshold of PPD, that is, the lower bound of thermal comfort at which the occupant can tolerate. Note that both P H V A C and P P D are normalized here. We set P P D t h r e s ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) and usually close to 0. w e and w c are heuristically designed to weigh the importance of two reward signals and make the reward function as the linear combination of these two reward signals. The design of weights here is tunable for different optimization objectives in respect of the user\u2019s will. In the paper, we use 0.4 and 0.6 (see Table 2) as an example to prove the effectiveness of our proposed method. For convenience, w e and w c add up to 1 in our paper. 4 Methodology 4.1 ODCP In [40], the authors propose an online parametric Dirichlet change point algorithm (ODCP). They model the compositional data as sampling from a family of Dirichlet distributions with a group of parameters α ( 1 ) , α ( 2 ) , \u2026 , α ( k ) . A Dirichlet distribution with parameter α ( r ) , r = 1 , \u2026 , k , generates sample data x i , τ r − 1 < i ≤ τ r . Based on the data modeling, ODCP detects single change point by a hypothesis testing framework. For an active observation window A , { x 1 , \u2026 , x t } , the null hypothesis and the alternate hypothesis are follows: \u2022 H 0 : A is generated by a single Dirichlet distribution. \u2022 H τ : A is generated by two Dirichlet distribution divided at some τ , 1 < τ < t . Calculating the log-likelihood ratio of two hypothesizes, a significance test is carried on to determine whether an alternative change point should be accepted. In ODCP, multiple change points are identified by performing a sequence of single change point detections (see Stage 2 in Fig. 5): if a change point τ is detected in an active observation window A of size I , { x 1 , \u2026 , x I } , then the active observation window is reset to begin at τ ; otherwise, new observation is added to the active observation window. With respect to the real data, [40] justifies that general multivariate data can be transformed into compositional data with the invariance of statistical properties. In addition, although MDP does not produce independent and identically distributed samples of multivariate data required by ODCP, [40] explains that it is still reasonable to utilize ODCP for experience tuples. Experiments in [40] also show the efficiency of ODCP in detecting change points between alternating MDPs. 4.2 Deep Q network Deep Q network (DQN) combines Q-learning and deep neural network. As mentioned before, Q-learning is a value-based method. It learns a lookup table called a Q-table to store Q-values for specific state\u2013action ( s , a ) pairs. Thus, Q-learning is also called tabular Q-learning. The Q-values are updated by the experience tuple ( s t , a t , r t , s t + 1 ) every iteration the agent interacts with the environment. The update rule is based on the Bellman equation: (10) Q ( s , a ) = Q ( s , a ) + α ( r + γ max a \u2032 Q ( s \u2032 , a \u2032 ) − Q ( s , a ) ) where α is the learning rate and γ is the discount factor. Tabular Q-learning methods suffer from explosive memory for tracking tremendous state\u2013action pairs when faced with MDP with large size. For example, in our HVAC control problem, each zone has 15 state variables (see Table 1), among which most are continuous variables such as outdoor air temperature (OAT) and Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied (PPD). Thus, our RL controller faces a high-dimensional and continuous state space. It would be trapped by high computational complexity and memory expanse if we use tabular Q-learning. Deep neural network can relieve us from those troubles and guarantee the performance by its ability in approximation. [24] proposes a two-network design for DQN algorithm: one is called Q network Q ( s , a ; θ ) and the other one is called target network Q ˆ ( s , a ; θ − ) . The former selects the optimal action with respect to the state. While the latter generates the target value as a reference for the update of the former. At update iteration i, the Q network is updated by minimizing the mean-square error between Q ( s , a ; θ ) and Q ˆ ( s , a ; θ − ) , i.e., DQN loss (see Eq. (11)). With the loss, parameters of the Q network are updated by a stochastic gradient descent algorithm. Parameters of the target network are slowly replaced with those of the Q network. (11) L i ( θ i ) = E r + γ max a \u2032 Q ˆ ( s \u2032 , a \u2032 ; θ i − ) − Q ( s , a ; θ i ) 2 Besides deep neural network, DQN adopts experience replay buffer [24], which allows that a batch of experience tuples can be randomly sampled from the buffer for Q-network update. Replay buffer can prevent the high correlation of the learning experiences and thus help the agent learn more efficiently. As for the action selection of the Q network, exploration and exploitation should be well designed throughout the whole training process of the agent. Exploration means to try new actions whereas exploitation prefers to employ the best actions known from learning. One strategy for balancing them is ε -greedy, that is, with the probability of 1 − ε , the agent selects the action with the highest Q-value, while with probability ε , the agent selects a random action. We adopt ε -greedy in our DQN design. 4.3 Non-stationary DQN method Our proposed non-stationary DQN algorithm for HVAC control in non-stationary building environments is shown in Algorithm 1. Before we further explain the details of the applied algorithm, some preliminary assumptions on Algorithm 1 must be demonstrated. \u2022 We assume that the MDP context in non-stationary environments lasts enough time, i.e., at least one week. It is reasonable for collecting enough samples for ODCP to detect non-stationarity. Emergencies are not considered in this paper as they only account for negligible influence on control policy if we consider long-term optimization. \u2022 We assume that the major factor causing the non-stationary building environment is periodic like the local weather conditions. The MDP context will be active again after a period. For example, if the local weather transitions follow a distinct seasonal pattern, then an MDP context working for the building environment currently will be activated in a year. Therefore, we set the learning timesteps T (see line 1 in Algorithm 1) based on some prior knowledge of the period. In the beginning, the Q network and the target network are initialized randomly with the same parameters together with a memory buffer for experience storage. Then the initial tuple 〈 D , Q , Q ˆ 〉 for a DQN agent is added into an empty agent list as shown in line 6. The training process of the DQN agent starts, which can be divided into 3 stages (see Fig. 5). Over the first M 0 episodes, we apply the baseline DQN algorithm to learn a basic DQN model called the pretrained DQN (see line 11\u201312), which does not consider non-stationarity in weather conditions and serves to collect experience tuples { ( s t , r t , s t + 1 ) } , t =1,2, \u2026, T, for change point detection. At Stage 2, the ODCP algorithm is performed on experience tuples collected throughout episode M 0 to find the change points as shown in line 30\u201332. Meanwhile, the number of MDP contexts and their activated time intervals are known. Finally, at Stage 3, we replace L with a 〈 D , Q , Q ˆ 〉 -tuple list. The number of tuples in L is equal to the context number, and each tuple is initialized as line 3\u20135. To make a distinction, we call each DQN in agent list context DQN. Over the training episodes after episode M 0 , context DQN is updated only in the time interval when its corresponding MDP context is activated, as shown in line 13\u201315. Here we explain the advantage of utilizing ODCP to experience tuples from a pretrained DQN instead of experience tuples from the very first episode. As ODCP detects change points by likelihood estimation and significance test, it is sensitive to the noise of the sampled data. We assume that the pretrained DQN has learned a basic policy for common situations in all MDP contexts, and its experience tuples can approximately be of the typical distributions sampled from the MDP contexts for the control strategy. Thus, it can reduce the potential noise for change point detection. If we execute ODCP after the first episode, the confidence of likelihood estimation might suffer from the large variation of data brought by random exploration in early episodes. As for the learning steps of the DQN agent as shown in line 17\u201328, the Q network is updated by sampling a minibatch of experiences from the replay buffer as mentioned in the last section, maintaining the independent and identically distributed sample assumption for the learning model. In line 28, the target network is updated K steps slower than the Q network with a soft update parameter β , 0 < β < 1 . Unlike the common ε -greedy strategy, we decrease ε value linearly along the whole training process, as shown in line 34. 5 Case study The effectiveness of our proposed method will be demonstrated through simulations. Our proposed method will be compared with the vanilla DQN and a rule-based controller. For clear clarification, we call them non-stationary DQN, baseline DQN and rule-based controller in the following content. 5.1 Simulation building environment We consider a reference building model designed by the US. DOE [41]. It is a 463 m 2 single-story building divided into 4 exterior and one interior conditioned zones and a return plenum (see Fig. 6 for 3D view and Fig. 7 for plan view). It is equipped with electric equipment and lights in different zones. The light, electric equipment and occupant activity produce heat inside the system. The building climate is controlled by a packaged variable air volume (VAV) system with a DX cooling coil and gas heating coils. The VAV system is shown in Fig. 2. The air handling units bring in the outdoor air which is cooled by the electric main cooling coil or heated by the electric main heating coil that contains an evaporative condenser pump and a basin heater. Then, the air is supplied to different zones by the supply fan. Each zone heats the air supplied according to their thermostat setpoints. Thus, the total HVAC electric power demand is defined as the sum of the demand from all the HVAC facilities, including the main electric heating coil, the electric heating coils in Zone 1\u20135, the supply fan, the main electric cooling coil, the cooling coil evaporative condenser pump, and the cooling coil basin heater. Supposing that the building locates at Allegheny County, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA, the yearly TMY3 weather profile for the local area is used for the training of the RL agent. TMY3, short for Typical Meteorological Year 3, is the weather data set of hourly values of solar radiation and meteorological elements for one year, which represent typical weather conditions [42]. 5.2 Implementation details We refer to the simulation framework used in [43]. This simulation framework (see Fig. 8) consists of the control methods implemented by Python scripts, and the simulation environment which wrapped the EnergyPlus [30] model in OpenAI Gym interface [44]. The simulation environment includes EnergyPlus and BCVTB (building control virtual test bed). BCVTB serves as a connector for different simulation programs to run co-simulation [45]. In a simulation run, an EnergyPlus instance is created using the input definition file and the data exchange file. Input definition file defines the building physics, HVAC system and simulation settings. The data exchange file defines the observation variables and control variables. In the data-exchange stage, variables can be read and written by python scripts for control. The processor converts the raw observations to state and reward information for controllers. Every simulation run starts at 0:00, January 1st and ends at 0:00, April 1st in a nonleap year, that is, 90 days. The granularity of the EnergyPlus simulation is 15 min. For RL agent training, a simulation run is called a training episode. In addition to the whole simulation framework and simulation settings, we also present the detailed design of the neural network and related hyperparameters (see Table 2). Both the neural network design and hyperparameters are the same for non-stationary DQN and baseline DQN. For the single-zone problem, the training episode number is 400. When the non-stationary DQN agent finishes the 100th training episode, i.e., M 0 = 100 (see Algorithm 1), we apply ODCP to the experience tuples throughout the episode. The minimum length of the active observation window for a single changepoint detection is 1344, that is, two weeks, as we assume that there is at most one change point in any window of two weeks for our building environment. For the multi-zone problem, the training episode number is 250. When the agent finishes the 50th training episode, i.e., M 0 = 50 , we apply ODCP to the experience tuples. 5.3 Convergence of non-stationary DQN As shown in Fig. 9, both two curves become steady as the training evolves. Notice that the convergence of baseline DQN is faster compared with non-stationary DQN. The reasons lie in two aspects. First, non-stationary DQN has to train multiple context DQNs. There will be more DQNs in the multi-zone problem. In each training episode, context DQNs are updated respectively by the experiences in their activated time intervals. Therefore, they need more episodes to collect enough experiences for learning. Second, except for the first context DQN, the start state of a context DQN is exactly the end state of the last one. Context DQNs have to spend more time learning control strategies for variant start states. The details of time cost are as follows: A computer with Intel 32-core Xeon(R) Gold 6130 CPU and NVIDIA GTX 3090 GPU is used for training. For non-stationary DQN, it takes 200 episodes to converge in the single-zone problem while it takes 175 episodes in the multi-zone problem. In the single-zone problem, one iterative training process takes 42 s to finish; in the multi-zone problem, one iterative training process takes 77 s to finish. For baseline DQN, it takes 100 episodes to converge in the single-zone problem while it also takes 100 episodes in the multi-zone problem. In the single-zone problem, one iterative training process takes 35 s to finish; in the multi-zone problem, one iterative training process takes 79 s to finish. Considering episodes at the end, we can see that the average cumulative reward of non-stationary DQN is higher than that of baseline DQN. As shown in Table 3, in the single-zone problem the average cumulative reward of non-stationary DQN is 5% higher than that of baseline DQN meanwhile the standard deviation is 39% smaller. Meanwhile, in the multi-zone problem, the average cumulative reward of non-stationary DQN is 15% higher than that of baseline DQN while the standard deviation is 57% smaller. 5.4 Performance in the single-zone problem We apply the well-trained models to the training environment. As shown in Fig. 10, both two controllers satisfy the occupant thermal comfort maintaining PPD lower than 10%. The energy consumption curves are nearly periodic as two controllers learn to work during the occupied hours every weekday. By checking the rest hours like the weekends when there is no occupant inside the zone, both two controllers learn to maintain the heating and cooling setpoints at the limitation of the setpoint band to idle the coils of VAV boxes avoiding unnecessary energy consumption. In Fig. 11, the baseline DQN controller conducts heating actions from 0:00 to 4:00 on March 20th (see Fig. 11(a)). The state resulting in the heating actions turns out to be similar to the state at 6:00 on February 28th (see Fig. 11(b)) when it is the very moment both the baseline DQN controller and the non-stationary controller have learned to start heating for the working hours. It seems that heating actions are appropriate for the state under the environment context on February 28th but not for the state under the environment context on March 20th, since the baseline DQN controller has to conduct cooling actions from 0:00 to 4:00 on March 20th to correct the mistakes. We call this situation \u2018mistake and correct\u2019 in this study, which causes unnecessary energy use and can be seen frequently when being controlled by the baseline DQN controller, but hardly occurs when being controlled by the non-stationary controller. In Fig. 12, the baseline DQN controller fails to raise the temperature before the working hours and causes a huge short-term discomfort (see Fig. 12(a)). This is because the baseline DQN keeps the heating setpoint at the limit until 7:15 as it believes it is facing a state similar to that at 3:30 on February 26th (see Fig. 12(b)). The baseline DQN fails to recognize the different environment context in these two periods, which thus delay the heating behaviors. In contrast, the non-stationary DQN learns the right timings to raise the temperature for different environment contexts. Considering the two examples above, it seems that the control policy of the baseline DQN controller is not stable when faced with some states though the controller has been trained for a long time. In contrast, the non-stationary DQN controller can react properly for similar states of different contexts. The reason is that the baseline DQN controller gets confused when it learns experiences from different contexts. Although some states seem similar, the rewards and next states can differ greatly since the experiences come from contexts with distinct dynamics. Then errors occur when we use the Bellman equation (see Eq. (11)) to update Q-values. As a result, the action selection of the baseline DQN controller is ambiguous as it tends to be neutral towards optimal control policies for different contexts. Besides, the non-stationary DQN controller is compared with a rule-based controller, which maintains the heating setpoint at 24 °C and cooling setpoint at 26 °C for working hours when the occupant number is larger than 0. When there is no occupant, it sets the heating and cooling setpoints at 15 °C and 30 °C. The results are shown in Fig. 13 and related discussions will be presented in the next subsection. 5.5 Performance in the multi-zone problem Fig. 13 shows the cumulative reward, average total HVAC electric demand power and average PPD of the three controllers in the single-zone problem and the multi-zone problem. In both the single-zone problem and the multi-zone problem, the cumulative rewards of non-stationary DQN and baseline DQN are higher than that of the rule-based controller. Although the average total HVAC electric demand power of the rule-based controller is lower, the average PPD and the standard deviation of PPD are much higher than those of the two DQN based methods and keep away from the desired comfort range for the indoor thermal environment. Occupants\u2019 thermal comfort cannot be guaranteed by the rule-based controller. Compared to baseline DQN, in the single-zone problem, non-stationary DQN reduces the average total HVAC electric demand power by 2% and the average PPD by 9%; in the multi-zone problem, non-stationary DQN reduces the average total HVAC electric demand power by 13% and the average PPD by around 7% for each zone. The improvement in energy saving might seem marginal for the single-zone problem, but this is because the improvement of a single zone is diluted in the total HVAC demand of all zones. Besides, non-stationary DQN reduces variation in occupant comfort with a smaller standard deviation in PPD. As for the total demand, the average total HVAC electric demand power in the multi-zone problem is larger than that in the single-zone problem because more energy is required to satisfy the thermal comfort in 5 zones. As can be seen in Fig. 14, 5 zones detect similar change points and take similar action series throughout 90 days. In addition, the change points of Zone 1 in the multi-zone problem are different from those in the single-zone problem. The reason is that besides weather conditions, there is another non-stationary factor in the multi-zone problem, that is, the actions of other controllers, since other controllers are controlled by RL agents rather than by a fixed schedule. However, the non-stationarity of controller actions seems to be also highly influenced by weather conditions (see Fig. 10 and Fig. 14). Therefore, although a new non-stationary factor is introduced, the multi-zone problem still consists with our assumption about periodic factors in the non-stationary DQN algorithm (see Section 4.3). Comparing the results of the single-zone and multi-zone problems, we find that when controlled by the non-stationary DQN controller, the energy consumption of Zone 1 in the multi-zone problem is higher than the energy consumption of Zone 1 in the single-zone problem. Checking the actions in January when the outdoor air temperature is low, we find that the extra energy consumption is spent on the forward heating actions during the rest hours between two weekdays (as shown in Fig. 15). The forward heating action means the controller brings the heating timing forward from around 6:00, when working hours are about to begin, to around 0:00. The explanation might be that under low outdoor air temperature, more heating time is required for all 5 zones to raise and stabilize the indoor air temperature. The forward heating actions of the non-stationary DQN controller can hardly be seen after January, as shown in Fig. 16(a). However, the forward heating actions of the baseline DQN controller can still be found in February (see Fig. 16(b)). It is another evidence that baseline DQN fails to learn optimal actions for different environment contexts, which leads to unwanted energy waste. 5.6 Performance in areas with non-stationarity of different levels The weather conditions in Pittsburgh are of the temperate continental climate, which often has a significant annual variation in temperature (hot summers and cold winters). In addition, every simulation starts at 0:00, January 1st and ends at 0:00, April 1st, which covers the period when the temperature rises significantly. Therefore, we believe that the weather conditions in Pittsburgh show typical non-stationarity in this HVAC control problem. Nevertheless, an experiment is conducted to compare the non-stationarity of different levels caused by two kinds of weather conditions, that is, middle latitude continental climate and low latitude marine climate. We use the typical weather profile in 6 cities for simulation in the single-zone control problem. Among the 6 cities, Pittsburgh, Beijing, and Dunhuang are of middle latitude continental climate; while Shenzhen, Miami, and Bangkok are of low latitude marine climate. To show the difference between the two climates, we pick up outdoor air temperature as an example, which has a major influence on the building thermal model. Fig. 17(a) shows the temperature evolution from January 1st to March 31st in 6 cities. Temperature rise is significant in cities of middle latitude continental climate, while temperature trend seems steady in cities of low latitude marine climate. It is suggested that the formers have more non-stationarity caused by weather conditions. Fig. 17(b) shows the convergence curve of non-stationary DQN and baseline DQN in the single-zone problem for 6 cities. Non-stationary DQN increases the average episode reward after it is converged for all 6 cities. For those cities with more obvious non-stationarity, the improvement is more significant accordingly. Therefore, non-stationary DQN works for HVAC control in areas with non-stationarity of different levels. 5.7 Stability of non-stationary DQN To prove the stability of non-stationary DQN, we conduct some experiments where disturbance happens at random timesteps. Disturbance means that the setpoints are set to be the boundaries before some timestep during the simulation. To be more concrete, we adopt 3 boundary settings: i heating setpoint = 15 °C, cooling setpoint = 15 °C. i i heating setpoint = 15 °C, cooling setpoint = 30 °C. i i i heating setpoint = 30 °C, cooling setpoint = 30 °C. In addition, we randomly choose 4 timesteps as recovery points from the 8640 timesteps (every 15 mins in 90 days): 264, 1800, 5796, 6766. For example, if we assign the recovery point to be 1800 and adopt boundary settings i , before recovery point 1800 the setpoints are set to be 15 °C, 15 °C, while after recovery point the setpoints are controlled by the trained RL controller. As shown in Fig. 18, non-stationary DQN can adjust the indoor temperature to get everything back on track. Shortly after the disturbance, the state trajectories and reward trajectories can return to the no-disturbance trajectories respectively. This indicates that non-stationary DQN obtained deployment stability: first, the size of the state space and the action space in the HVAC control problem is moderate for the RL controller to explore and learn the Q values for nearly all the states; second, deep neural network can approximate the Q values for similar states even not explored. 5.8 Generalization of non-stationary DQN To validate the generalization of our non-stationary DQN algorithm to an unseen environment, both the well-trained non-stationary DQN controller and baseline DQN controller are further tested in a new building environment. Here we specify some similarities and differences of the training and test environment settings. Considering the model assumptions in Section 2.2, it requires a similar non-stationary MDP in the test environment for the application of the trained DRL controller. In Section 4.3, we assume the major cause of the non-stationary environment is periodic weather conditions. Thus, in the test environment we adopt the same weather profile, building model and VAV system used in training. The major difference lies in the schedules of occupancy and electric equipment. As shown in Fig. 20, the occupants and equipment follow a periodic schedule. The working hours start at 8:15 and end at 21:15 on weekdays. However, it is more realistic for occupants and equipment to follow a schedule with randomness. In the test environment, we test our well-trained DQN controllers with a stochastic occupancy schedule and a stochastic equipment schedule provided by [46]. The stochastic occupancy schedule is generated by the LBNL simulator [47] and the stochastic equipment schedule is based on the occupancy and added with Gaussian noise [46] (see Fig. 20). All five zones in the building adopt the new schedules of occupancy and equipment. The same 90-day simulation is applied in the test case. The test results are shown in Fig. 19. Similar to the results in Fig. 13, the average total HVAC electric demand power and average PPD of the non-stationary DQN controller is lower than that of the baseline DQN controller in both the single-zone and multi-zone problems. Therefore, when faced with an unseen stochastic schedule, non-stationary DQN still exceeds baseline DQN after the offline training with a fixed schedule. 6 Conclusion In this study, a novel HVAC control method combining active building environment change detection and deep Q network is proposed to minimize the HVAC energy consumption with maintaining the occupant thermal comfort. This non-stationary DQN method identifies the environment contexts by detecting the change points of the building environment and learns more effective control strategies respectively. Case study results prove the effectiveness of our proposed method: (i) compared to the state-of-art DQN method, our proposed method ends up training with higher episode cumulative reward; (ii) our proposed method can save extra HVAC energy consumption by 13% at most and reduce comfort violation by 9% at most; (iii) our proposed method shows exceedingly good performance in both single-zone and multi-zone HVAC control problems; (iv) it also obtains stability against disturbance and generalization to unseen building environments. In future work, we aim to improve the method with consideration of more complicated situations and make it more applicable in the real world. First, the trade-off between energy savings and comfort satisfaction should be further studied by varying the weights of the energy consumption and the thermal comfort. Second, different from the simulation environment where the states can be acquired easily by input or calculation, the real building deployment requires an efficient design of the sensor system and the ability to reduce the potential errors of the sensor data. Third, to further enhance the learning efficiency, it can be investigated to include distributed learning in the framework, especially in the scenarios of large and complex HVAC systems. Moreover, in the district operation management involving multiple buildings, the RL agents should learn to do group decisions to achieve complicated objectives, for example, electric power peak load shifting. By exploring these directions, the non-stationary control method will be more robust and efficient for real-world deployment.

        "dc:description": "Energy consumption for heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) has increased significantly and accounted for a large proportion of building energy growth. Advanced control strategies are needed to reduce energy consumption with maintaining occupant thermal comfort. While compared to other control problems, HVAC control is faced with numerous restrictions from real building environments. One key restriction is non-stationarity, i.e., the varying HVAC system dynamics. Researchers have paid efforts to solve the non-stationarity problems through different approaches, among which deep reinforcement learning gains traction for its advantages in capturing real-time information, controlling adaptively to system feedbacks, avoiding tedious modeling works and combining with deep learning techniques. However, current researches solved non-stationarity in a passive manner which hinders its potential and adds instability in real application. To fill this research gap, we propose a novel HVAC control method combining active building environment change detection and deep Q network (DQN), named non-stationary DQN. This method aims to disentangle the non-stationarity by actively identifying the change points of building environments and learning effective control strategies for corresponding building environments. The simulation results demonstrate that this developed non-stationary DQN method outperforms the state-of-art DQN method in both single-zone control and multi-zone control tasks by saving unnecessary energy use and reducing thermal violation caused by non-stationarity. The improvement can reach 13% in energy-saving and 9% in thermal comfort. Besides, according to the results, our proposed method obtains stability against disturbance and generalization to an unseen building environment, which shows its robustness and potential in real-life applications.",
