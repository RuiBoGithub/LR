Fig. 20 Table 1 The main components used in TRNSYS to model the present system. Table 1 Component Type Description Double U-tube borehole thermal energy storage 557 A vertical heat exchanger that interacts thermally with the Earth mimics the U-tube borehole in TRNSYS. The ground heat exchanger works by cycling a fluid that carries heat either to or away from the ground, depending on the relative temperatures. A vertical borehole is drilled into the Earth in traditional U-tube ground heat exchanger setups. The next step is to inject a U-tube heat exchanger into the hole. It is common practice to place a ground heat exchanger's top section a few meters below ground level. The last step is to fill the borehole with Earth or a specific grout material. While conductive heat transfers go toward the storage volume, convective heat transfers happen inside the pipes. A global temperature, a localized solution, and a constant-flux solution are the three factors that determine the temperature below Earth. Both global and local concerns are addressed using an explicit finite difference method. For the steady flux, an analytical solution is obtained. After that, superposition methods are used to find the temperature. Energy wheel 667 The air handling unit of the ventilation system relies on an air-to-air heat recovery device or energy wheel to enhance efficiency, lower energy costs through waste heat recovery, and improve indoor air quality. This component transfers heat and, sometimes, moisture between two airstreams, typically the exhaust air leaving the building and the air coming in from the outside. As the wheel moves across both airstreams, it rotates continuously. When the wheel turns into this stream, it transfers heat and moisture from the exhaust air to the incoming outdoor air. Depending on the season, this process involves pre-heating or precooling the incoming air, which helps reduce the energy required to get the air up to the desired temperature. Heating coil 753 By modeling the action of a simple heating coil, this component makes the air feel warmer as it passes through it. In order to determine the air and water conditions at the exit, this model employs the bypass fraction approach for heating coils. According to the bypass factor method, a portion of the air stream will eventually cool down to the coil fluid's average temperature. But there's still some airflow in the stream that the coil does not affect at all; this is the bypass fraction. The controls on this part allow you to keep the output fluid or air constant by rerouting some of the fluid stream around the coil. Cooling coil 508 A bypass technique is used to simulate the cooling coil, allowing the user to designate a portion of the air stream to bypass the coil. The remaining air stream is expected to exit the coil under saturated circumstances and the average temperature of the fluid within. After the coil, the two air streams are combined. Given the air and fluid stream input conditions, the coil cools and dehumidifies the air stream as much as feasible when operating in its unrestrained (uncontrolled) mode. Alternatively, the model can bypass fluid inside the coil to keep the fluid or air outlet temperature below a user-specified maximum. Fan 744 It simulates the variable and constant speed fans that match the user-specified inlet flow rate to the exit mass flow. Heat exchanger 91 This component models a heat exchanger with a constant and design-independent effectiveness when transferring heat between fluids (rather than air). The maximum practicable heat transfer is determined by the minimum capacity rate and the input temperatures of the cold and hot sides of the fluid, respectively. Iterative feedback controller 22 In order to keep the target variable at its setpoint, this component simulates iterative feedback controllers that determine the necessary control signal. Accurate setpoint tracking is provided using TRNSYS iterations. It is appropriate to use this controller if the goal is to mimic a real-world feedback controller that makes discrete or continual adjustments to its control signal. PID controller 23 Three signals are used by the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller: two integral and derivative signals and one proportional to the tracking error. It is based on state-of-the-art discrete algorithms for PID controls and includes anti-windup for the integrator. The PID controller can operate in both the \u201citerative\u201d (mode 0) and \u201creal life\u201d (non-iterative) modes. Pump 110 This component simulates a variable speed pump capable of maintaining any mass flow rate at the outlet between zero and the rated value. The pump's mass flow rate is linearly related to the control signal setting. On the other hand, a polynomial is used to model pump power draw. Pressure drop effects and pump starting and stopping characteristics are not modeled. Table 2 The values of significant parameters at the design condition.

The present article proposes a novel smart building energy system utilizing deep geothermal resources through naturally-driven borehole thermal energy storage interacting with the district heating network. It includes an intelligent control strategy for lowering operational costs, making better use of renewables, and avoiding CO2 emissions by eliminating heat pumps and cooling machines to address the heating and cooling demands of a commercial building in Uppsala, a city near Stockholm, Sweden. After comprehensively conducting techno-environmental and economic assessments, the system is fine-tuned using artificial neural networks (ANN) for optimization. The study aims to determine which ANN design and training procedure is the most efficient in terms of accuracy and computing speed. It also assesses well-known optimization algorithms using the TOPSIS decision-making technique to find the best trade-off among various indicators. According to the parametric results, deeper boreholes can collect more geothermal energy and reduce CO2 emissions. However, deep drilling becomes more expensive overall, suggesting the need for multi-objective optimization to balance costs and techno-environmental benefits. The results indicate that Levenberg-Marquardt algorithms offer the optimum trade-off between computation time and error minimization. From a TOPSIS perspective, while the dragonfly algorithm is not ideal for optimizing the suggested system, the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm is the most efficient since it yields more ideal points rated below 100. The optimization yields a higher energy production of 120 kWh/m2, as well as a decreased levelized cost of energy of 57 $/MWh, a shorter payback period of two years, and a reduced CO2 index of 1.90 kg/MWh. The analysis reveals that despite the high investment costs of 382.50 USD/m2, the system is financially beneficial in the long run due to a short payback period of around eight years, which aligns with the goals of future smart energy systems: reduce pollution and increase cost-effectiveness.

The need for building heating and cooling is impacted by climate change, which in turn might significantly affect the emissions of greenhouse gases [2]. For example, research by Berger et al. [3] on the performance of office buildings in Vienna (Austria) reveals a notable increase in cooling needs but a minor decrease in heating demands. Therefore, taking a comprehensive approach to reducing CO2 emissions in the building sector while handling both heating and cooling needs is crucial. This means ensuring that heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) units are designed to be energy efficient and that low-emission energy sources are integrated more effectively to meet both demands [4]. Among various renewable sources, borehole thermal energy storage has been recognized as a great way to fulfill the high energy demands in commercial buildings [5]. These systems efficiently decrease reliance on conventional energy sources by utilizing the underground as a medium to store thermal energy, whether excess heat or cooling capacity, which can then be retrieved and used as needed [6]. By reducing the fluctuation of renewable energy sources, the strategic installation of boreholes makes it easier to use them more widely. It also lowers costs, increases energy security, and helps building sectors become less carbon-dependent [7]. Arghand et al. [8] analyzed the feasibility of hybridizing borehole thermal energy storage with the district heating network and compared it with the same system integrated with a heat pump to meet the thermal needs of an office building in Gothenburg (Sweden). They showed that removing the heat pump is economically better due to the reduced borehole size, resulting in lower investment costs. Spitler and Gehlin [9] assessed the performance of a geothermal-driven commercial building in Stockholm consisting of 20 boreholes with a depth of 200 m. They reported the proposed system has a heating seasonal performance factor of around 4, making it a potent solution for addressing the high demand in cold climates. In a recent study, Quirosa et al. [10] proposed a smart double-loop borehole-driven energy system interacting with the district heating and cooling network to decarbonize the building sector. According to the results, their system has an annual cost of around 100,000 \u20ac, with the highest adoption in the regions with extreme temperatures during summer. Durga et al. [11] investigated a naturally-driven system comprising borehole thermal energy storage and heat pumps to meet the heating and cooling needs of Cornell University's campus in the USA. They showed that 37 boreholes with 90 m depth supply more than 90% of the total space heating demand with a payback time of around ten years. Pokhrel et al. [12] evaluated a green smart system's techno-environmental and economic aspects based on borehole thermal energy storage. They concluded that the proposed system could save 1100 tons of CO2 annually compared to the conventional system driven by natural gas. Usman et al. [13] compared the practicality of various renewable sources, including fourteen configurations in four climates. They revealed that the borehole-driven heating and cooling system integrated with a heat pump is superior for cold climates due to the highest energy saving and carbon mitigation. The implementation of intelligent controllers in smart HVAC systems presents a viable approach to attaining built environments that are sustainable, comfortable, and energy-efficient [14]. In order to efficiently manage energy usage, production, and storage, it also makes it easier to incorporate renewable energy sources at a higher level and integrate thermal energy storage, opening the door to smarter and more energy-efficient building designs. Lately, Woo-Shem et al. [15] proposed a smart control framework applied to the HVAC system of a residential building in Sacramento (California, USA) to assess how it works against the traditional ON-OFF controllers for peak shaving. Their results demonstrated that operational cost is reduced by about 50% with better occupant thermal comfort. A rule-based adaptive control design was applied to the HVAC system of a subway station in Hong Kong by Ren et al. [16] to assess energy saving while satisfying the occupants' well-being. Their results showed that cooling needs are reduced by over 20%. The comparison of a new smart control system against the traditional ones implemented in an HVAC system in an Australian office building was evaluated by Gobinath et al. [17], resulting in a lower primary energy of 20%. Zhuang et al. [14] established a predictive-based control framework to optimize an HVAC system's energy use and operation. They reported that energy saving and thermal satisfaction are improved by about 17.5% and 17% thanks to making the HVAC system smarter. In addition to making the HVAC system more intelligent and incorporating higher low-emission sources, adopting more advanced models, like high-temperature cooling systems, is of great importance, aligning well with the efforts to enhance the efficiency and sustainability of building energy systems [18]. Higher cooling operating temperatures result in less primary energy and function more effectively because there is less temperature differential between the cooling medium and the surrounding air [19]. Additionally, they are easier to combine with renewable energy sources like geothermal-driven boreholes, allowing them to effectively enjoy free cooling for a greater portion of the year. Since chilled beams and radiant cooling systems make good use of water at temperatures too high for conventional air conditioning systems but which can be successfully recovered from borehole thermal energy storage, they are very suitable with high-temperature cooling techniques [20]. Because of this compatibility, the cooling process uses less energy overall, and renewable energy sources can be more easily integrated, helping to achieve net-zero energy targets. According to research by Saber et al. [21], high-temperature cooling systems, such as radiant cooling panels and chilled beams, can save operational energy by more than 40%, depending on how they are designed and used. Dai et al. [22] assessed the performance of chilled beams in various systems from the environmental ratio, cooling performance, and energy-saving points of view. They concluded that the proposed model is superior to the traditional systems driven by chillers, and making them smart via proper controllers and efficient integration reduces unnecessary energy. In another work, Pieskä et al. [23] presented the benefits of high-temperature cooling technologies to meet Europe's annual cooling growth of 3%. They also compared the thermodynamic aspects of direct and radiant cooling systems naturally driven by boreholes. According to their outcomes, the radiant cooling model is an excellent option due to lower electricity use by 70%. For smart design and energy systems management, multi-objective optimization is becoming indispensable, especially for integrating efficiently, lowering emissions, and satisfying demands while minimizing energy [24]. This method prioritizes the building's occupants' comfort and functionality over several competing goals, including lowering operational costs, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and improving performance efficiency [25]. Different algorithms are frequently used to optimize building energy systems to manage the intricate trade-offs between all indicators. Gholamian et al. [26] applied the genetic algorithm to optimize a renewable-based smart building energy system. They resulted in reduced energy costs and increased efficiency of about 8% and 13% thanks to the multi-objective optimization. However, performing multi-objective optimization in most energy simulators like TRNSYS is impossible. An external program like Python or MATLAB must be added to perform the optimization via co-simulation, which takes much time. For this, an artificial neural network (ANN) model as a part of machine learning is implemented to optimize in less time with minimal errors. Kaabinejadian et al. [27] applied the genetic algorithm optimizer and ANN to minimize energy costs and carbon emissions while maximizing the efficiency of a solar-based building energy system. Using the developed ANN, they demonstrated that the optimization runtime was reduced from 72 h to less than an hour. Behzadi et al. [28] combined the grey wolf method and ANN model to optimize a geothermal-driven high-temperature cooling and low-temperature heating system using MATLAB-TRNSYS. According to their results, optimization leads to a decrease in levelized energy cost of 24 $/MWh and an increase in performance efficiency of 12%. Saadmohammadi and Sajadi [29] performed ANN-assisted optimization of a smart building by applying TRNSYS and developing MATLAB code. According to their results, the optimal energy cost and emission of 12 \u20ac and 160 kg per Megawatt-hour are achieved via the genetic algorithm. A few important issues remain unresolved in the literature despite the intense interest and substantial research into heating and cooling storage/generation using borehole thermal energy storage. The main unknown is that geothermal-based building energy systems are expensive due to the high operational and investment costs of electrically driven components like heat pumps and absorption chillers, which questions profitability and prevents clean technologies from being widely used. Another significant issue is that HVAC systems use a significant amount of energy and do not use the available free heating and cooling resources because of the lack of integration and smart control framework. Considering these gaps, the proposed work presents a naturally-driven heating and cooling system consisting of seasonal borehole thermal energy storage interacting with the district heating network to improve energy security. The core idea here is the deep green cooling strategy, which is drilling far into the ground, where the heating and cooling demands are met without any heat pumps and machinery, resulting in minimal operational costs and environmental effects. Additionally, the system has an intelligent control framework consisting of several smart valves and PID controllers for higher renewable energy integration, minimizing component size through smart integration, and employing a high-temperature cooling resource as efficiently as possible. Moreover, the system's practicality is analyzed in TRNSYS and then optimized with ANN's aid as part of machine learning in MATLAB. Various ANN architectures and training algorithms are comprehensively compared to find the best with minimal computational time and the least error simultaneously. Besides, the widely used optimization algorithms, including non-dominated sorting genetic, grey wolf, dragonfly, and particle swarm, based on holistic approaches are assessed and compared to ascertain the best trade-off using the TOPSIS decision-making method. Eventually, the system performance is assessed by calculating the main indicators from techno-economic and environmental facets under the optimal conditions to see how it operates over the year. 2 Presentation of the building energy system Fig. 1 demonstrates a simple schematic of the proposed smart building energy system. As shown, the main primary mover on the supply side is the borehole thermal energy storage. It comprises twenty-five holes bored into the Earth. With the help of closed-loop pipes set up in these boreholes, a mixture of water and antifreeze is used as a heat transfer fluid. Soil and rock are heated or cooled by transferring excess thermal energy to the ground during periods of surplus energy, such as summer when it is hot and winter when it is cold. According to the figure, the smart control and monitoring units manage the operation of pumps, valves, and boreholes based on the outdoor and indoor conditions and the HVAC operation. When the outdoor air is cold during the heating season, the mixture of fluid goes into the borehole to extract the heat from the ground and run the free heating heat exchanger. The generated heat is transferred to the pre-heating coils of the air handling units to warm up the air before entering the rotary heat exchangers. The HVAC system of the proposed smart system has three lines, two connected to the offices and the other interacting with the restaurant. While the office lines are equipped with rotary heat exchangers, a run-around heat exchanger is used in the restaurant line to hinder the transformation of unpleasant particles like smoke, oil, and aromas. On the other hand, in warm hours, when the outdoor temperature exceeds the indoor comfort temperature, the stored cooling in winter is exploited from the ground through the boreholes and then transferred into the free cooling heat exchanger. The smart control unit decides whether the generated cooling enters the air handling units or the chilled beam. If the rotary or run-around heat exchanger outlet temperature is below the set points, the control unit directs the cold water to the air handling units' post-cooling coils. Otherwise, the rest of the cooling is used to run the passive chilled beam located in offices. Passive chilled beams rely entirely on the natural convection mechanism to transport air without mechanical ventilation, in contrast to active chilled beams, which employ a combination of primary air for ventilation and secondary air induced over the cooling coils. The standard installation location is on the ceiling. When heated air rises through a space, it encounters the chilled beam's cool surface. The air is cooled and made denser due to this contact; as a result, it falls back into the room, causing the temperature inside to drop again through a natural convection cycle. Ensuring that condensation does not occur in the passive chilled beam is crucial for maintaining good interior air quality and protecting building materials from damage. In order to avoid condensation, it is essential to ensure that the temperature of the cooling water supply is constantly higher than the dew point temperature of the indoor air. To prevent this, the proposed system employs advanced controllers equipped with sensors for detecting humidity and temperature. The controllers continuously monitor the temperature and humidity of the inside air in order to compute the dew point. When the dew point temperature approaches the temperature of the cooling water supply, the controllers adjust the temperature of the cooling water by mixing it with warmer return water. This results in a modest increase in the supply temperature, often by 0.5 °C above the dew point. This adaptive adjustment guarantees that the temperature of the cooling water remains above the dew point, preventing condensation. The system also interacts with the district heating network, 3rd generation, with a supply temperature of 100 °C, to meet the additional heating demands of the post-heating coils of the air handling units to reach the desired temperatures. Additionally, the heat from the network is used to run the radiators to meet the space heating demands and provide the domestic hot water needs. Finally, the figure shows that the electrical-driven components like pumps and energy wheels are connected to the electricity grid. As depicted, the proposed smart borehole-driven HVAC system interacting with the district heating network meets the space heating and cooling demands and the domestic hot water needs of a commercial building in Uppsala, Sweden. The building consists of offices and a restaurant with a total area of 10,000 m2. The Swedish construction and development company Skanska addressed the demand for this system, which has low energy bills and great performance efficiency, by utilizing innovative and sustainable deep green cooling technology. The concept involves boring a hole deep into the ground to transfer the building's cooling or heating without using much energy and doing away with heat pumps or electrical-driven devices. 3 Transient system simulation tool A simulation program called TRNSYS (TRaNsient SYstem Simulation Program) enables thorough thermodynamic analysis, modeling, and controlling energy systems. It is well known for its capacity to model transient system behavior, offering insightful information on the viability of different energy options. In order to determine the needs for heating and cooling as well as other significant indoor air quality parameters over time, it is also used to model the physics of buildings. It provides a versatile graphical user interface to model the system's dynamic behavior over the years. In addition to graphically showing the system's configuration, it makes model development much easier. The modular structure is TRNSYS's strongest point. The building blocks of TRNSYS that allow it to model different aspects of energy systems are called components created using the Fortran source code. Every part stands for physical equipment or a thermodynamic process. A group of engineers has developed components for TRNSYS, validated them against experimental data, and now authorized the University of Wisconsin Madison Solar Lab to share these components with other TRNSYS users. All the useful information about each component's mechanism and mathematical formulas can be found online or in TRNSYS documentation [30]. Table 1 describes the main components used in the TRNSYS studio to model and control the present smart energy system. The double-tube configuration was selected in the present system because of its enhanced heat transmission capabilities compared to single-tube systems. This design facilitates enhanced thermal exchange between the fluid and the surrounding ground, which is essential for consistently maintaining the optimum temperatures for heating and cooling throughout the year. Moreover, the double-tube system provides enhanced adaptability regarding installation depth and layout, rendering it suitable for diverse geological conditions. Table 2 indicates the values of decision variables. In the present system, the heat transfer fluid entering the double U-tube boreholes is a mixture of ethylene glycol (30%) and eater with the specific heat and density of 3.635 kJ.kg−1.K−1 and 1048 Kg.m−3, respectively. Moreover, the outer and inner radius of the U-tube pipes and the center-to-center half distance are 16 mm, 14 mm, and 24 mm. The effectiveness of the energy wheel is an input parameter that varies throughout the year and is collected from the building management system (Tekla). Therefore, it does not have any fixed value over the year. For this, we have defined the difference in energy wheel effectiveness (as seen in Table 2) as a key parameter calculating the difference between the actual and design effectiveness of the energy wheels. The zero value indicates that the wheel's effectiveness equals the input values provided by the Vasakronan company. After performing the thermodynamic assessment and finding the energy indicators, a detailed economic evaluation is conducted by carrying out the life cycle cost analysis. First, the investment, operation, maintenance, and total costs of each component and overall system are calculated. Then, the levelized cost of energy (LCOE), net present value (NPV), and payback time are assessed. The LCOE is the average cost per unit of energy produced. It considers the initial investment, maintenance, and operational costs. By evaluating future cash flows produced by the project and discounting them to their present value, NPV offers a thorough understanding of the system's profitability over its whole life. Payback Time estimates how long it will take for the system's savings or income to cover the initial investment. These metrics provide a comprehensive understanding of the financial viability of integrating different energy systems, assisting decision-makers in identifying the most affordable energy options for building applications and guaranteeing compliance with the objectives of reaching net-zero energy/costs standards. Table 3 indicates the investment cost of each component needed to accomplish the economic evaluation. In the table, L Borehole , m Air , Q Chilled beam , Q Coil , Q Heat exchanger , and W Pump are the borehole length in m, air flow rate entering the air handling unit in kg/h, cooling used by the chilled beam in kWh, heat transferred via coil and heat exchanger in kWh, and the power used by the pump in kWh. Moreover, electricity and heating prices are also required to determine operational and purchased energy costs in order to conduct an economic assessment. Table 4 shows the monthly variation of heating and electricity costs purchased from the networks in Uppsala. The heating cost model comprises energy (Table 4) and power. The energy required to create on each occasion is controlled by the power (effective) price applied to business customers, a fixed value of 94.2 $/kW/year [36]. In order to ensure that all customers have access to district heating, even during the coldest months, this calculation takes peak demand into account and estimates the optimal power of district heating lines. Following a comprehensive techno-economic evaluation, the system's environmental performance is analyzed by investigating the CO2 saving and CO2 emission index. Reducing carbon dioxide emissions by switching to more environmentally friendly methods, technology, or energy sources is what is referred to as \u201cCO2 saving\u201d in environmental analyses. The emissions linked to the borehole thermal energy storage system are compared to those produced by the district heating network during the same period in order to quantify this indication. This study clarifies how a project might lessen its impact on global warming by lowering its carbon footprint. Importantly, the CO2 Emission Index measures the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere as a result of energy production and is commonly given as kilograms of CO2 per megawatt-hour (kg CO2/MWh). Because their combustion produces much carbon dioxide, fossil fuels usually have a higher CO2 emission index than other energy sources. Since renewable energy sources like geothermal do not use fossil fuels for heating, cooling, or electricity generation (unless purchased from the network), so they produce significantly less carbon dioxide (CO2) than conventional power plants. 4 Optimization Building system optimization helps the shift toward a more robust and sustainable energy network by efficiently integrating renewable energy sources, reducing energy costs, and cutting CO2 emissions, all of which align with the future smart energy system requirements. Despite being a potent tool for analyzing energy systems comprehensively, one significant disadvantage of TRNSYS for energy system modeling is that multi-objective optimization cannot be directly performed in the simulation studio. This limitation means that an external program must be linked to TRNSYS to implement an optimization algorithm, which takes much time, adds complexity, and makes it more difficult to explore the trade-offs between various performance goals in an efficient manner. A promising way to address this difficulty is to apply the artificial neural network model as part of the machine learning package to perform multi-objective optimization with minimal error in the minimum computational time. 4.1 Artificial neural network (ANN) ANNs are computer models that draw inspiration from the neuronal network found in the human brain. They are made to be able to identify patterns, handle complicated data inputs, and carry out a variety of functions like decision-making, forecasting, and classification. An ANN comprises layers of connected neurons, where each connection represents a weight that is changed as the network learns. High flexibility and the capacity to simulate non-linear interactions between inputs and outputs\u2014a task that many conventional statistical approaches find challenging\u2014are the main advantages of ANNs. They are adept at managing massive volumes of data and are able to forecast new, unseen data by drawing generalizations from the data they have been trained on. This makes them especially helpful for pattern detection, forecasting, and optimizing complicated systems like smart building energy systems. Even with all of its benefits, ANNs have several drawbacks. Two important factors can greatly impact their effectiveness: inadequate training data and poorly designed networks. An ANN may underfit if it cannot discover the underlying patterns in the data through adequate training data. Overfitting can result from a network architecture that is poorly planned, particularly if it is excessively sophisticated for the task at hand. This results in poor performance on new, unknown data since the model learns the noise in the training data as if it were a major trend. Fig. 2 demonstrates the architecture of different ANN models, including function-fitting and cascade-forward neural networks, to analyze better and compare the interaction of input, hidden, and output layers. Cascade-forward and function-fitting neural networks are designed for different application domains and have quite different architectures and performance features. By figuring out the underlying function that connects input and output variables, function-fitting neural networks use a simple architecture that is optimized for regression tasks. (See Fig. 2.) On the other hand, the design of cascade-forward neural networks is more intricate, with extra connections that connect every layer to every other layer in addition to the input. When the input-output relationship is complicated or layered, this enhanced connectedness may help with performance by enabling a more sophisticated interpretation of the input data. But unlike function-fitting networks, the intricacy of cascade-forward networks can also lead to a larger danger of overfitting, requiring careful tuning and possibly additional data to attain optimal performance. The selection of training methods has a major effect on the performance of ANNs in addition to their architecture. This affects the ANNs' capacity to learn from data, converge to an optimal solution, and generalize to new data. Different training algorithms take different paths across the difficult terrain of the error function to reduce loss. The effectiveness, speed of convergence, and capacity of these algorithms to prevent overfitting or underfitting directly impact the performance of the ANN, determining its precision, dependability, and suitability for real-world scenarios. Fig. 3 compares all training algorithms, including Levenberg-Marquardt, Bayesian regularization, BFGS Quasi-Newton, resilient backpropagation, scaled conjugate gradient, conjugate gradient with Powell/Beale restarts, Fletcher-Powell conjugate gradient, Polak-Ribiére conjugate gradient, one step secant, variable learning Rate gradient descent, gradient descent with momentum, and gradient descent. It comprises a thorough comparison by talking about the benefits and drawbacks of each, emphasizing the convergence speed, computational efficiency, problem size suitability, and hyperparameter sensitivity. 4.2 Optimization algorithms It is impossible to overestimate the significance of multi-objective optimization in modern engineering problems. This paradigm allows for the simultaneous consideration of several, often conflicting aims, thereby addressing the inherent complexity of real-world problems. Multi-objective optimization offers an organized framework for managing trade-offs between environmental impact, cost-effectiveness, and system efficiency in domains such as energy systems analysis. By using a comprehensive approach, it is possible to find Pareto-optimal solutions, which are situations in which achieving one goal does not entail sacrificing another. This method yields a set of ideal answers instead of a single, potentially suboptimal result. There is a considerable improvement in performance between single-objective and multi-objective optimization. When comparing single-objective optimization to multi-objective optimization, there are substantial advantages. First, it thoroughly comprehends the problem domain by exposing the connections and compromises between various goals, which is essential for deliberative decision-making in complicated energy systems. This more comprehensive viewpoint aids in finding solutions that provide a fair compromise between conflicting goals, such as cutting costs while increasing energy efficiency and lowering emissions. Second, it makes it possible for decision-makers to consider a larger variety of viable options, which improves the adaptability and durability of energy planning and policy creation. Among many methods, the ones that stand out for their distinctive approaches and applications are the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA), multi-objective grey wolf optimizer (MOGWO), multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO), and dragonfly algorithm (DFA). \u2022 NSGA: A well-known evolutionary algorithm built on the idea of non-dominated sorting is called NSGA. To preserve variety among solutions, it makes use of a selection mechanism, crowding distance, and a quick, non-dominated sorting technique. Because it is so good at finding a wide range of optimal solutions over the whole Pareto front, NSGA-II is an excellent tool for solving complex, non-linear, and multi-modal optimization issues. It also performs exceptionally well when addressing complex multi-objective problems [38]. \u2022 MOGWO: Grey wolves' social framework and hunting methods served as inspiration for MOGWO. In order to explore and take advantage of the search space, it imitates the team dynamics and leadership of wolves. Its resilience, adaptability, and ease of use when managing multi-modal functions define it. However, the problem's nature can significantly impact its performance, and in complicated multi-objective settings, it might have trouble achieving fast convergence [39]. \u2022 MOPSO: Fish and birds' social interactions served as inspiration for MOPSO. It highlights how members of a swarm move according to their individual experiences and the triumphs of their neighbors. It is especially renowned for its rapid convergence, simplicity, and ease of implementation. Nevertheless, on issues with extremely complex Pareto fronts, its performance may deteriorate, and it can occasionally enter local optima [40]. \u2022 DFA: The natural swarming behavior of dragonflies influences DFA. In order to balance local and global search space exploration, it employs two phases: exploration and exploitation. Navigating complicated multi-objective settings requires DFA's flexibility and ability to strike a balance between exploration and exploitation, which it possesses in spades. Similar to MOGWO, its efficacy varies according to the nature of the particular problem and may need precise parameter adjustment [41]. Fig. 4 demonstrates and compares the flowchart of the procedure of each algorithm. There are benefits and drawbacks to each of these approaches. Many multi-objective issues turn to NSGA because of its reputation for robustly investigating a diverse selection of Pareto-optimal solutions. Drawing on natural behaviors, MOGWO and DFA provide attractive exploration and exploitation mechanisms, yet they may require tweaks to perform well in environments with multiple objectives. While MOPSO has received praise for its efficiency and simplicity, it may need a few modifications to meet the demands of multi-objective optimization, which are more complicated and diverse. The problem's specifications, such as the objective functions' characteristics, the desired diversity of solutions, and the available computational resources, dictate the method(s) to be used. 5 Validation Following a thorough evaluation of the system from every point of view, the validation is carried out by analyzing the accuracy of the main components and the proposed artificial intelligence approach. For this, the heat extracted from and transferred to the ground via borehole thermal energy storage is assessed and compared with the in-situ measurement data obtained by the building management system provided by the building owner, Vasakronan AB. 5.1 Component validation Fig. 5 compares the measurement and simulation values of heat transferred from and stored in the ground to validate the performance of the borehole thermal energy storage system. The validation process entailed comparing the simulated outcomes and average actual data from 2021 to 2023 collected from the building management system (Tekla) of the studied building, \u201cJuvelen,\u201d which is under the control of Vasakronan. The figure also indicates the relative error between the simulation and measurement data to better compare each method and evaluate the simulation's accuracy over the year. According to the left side of the figure, the simulation results are close to the measurement, showing the proposed model's reliability in mimicking the real-time system performance. A closer look at the figure shows that while the maximum measurement and simulation heat transfer of 2183.50 kWh and 2014.50 kWh are achieved on the 177th day of the year, the minimum values are 5.60 kWh and 5.10 kWh in November (day = 322). According to the right side of Fig. 5, for more than 255 days of a year, the relative error is below 10%, with a maximum value of 18% on the 171st day of the year. The greater differences between real and simulated data during summer, as opposed to winter, are likely attributable to the challenges of precisely modeling dynamic thermal phenomena, such as the fluctuating efficiency of heat extraction, thermal saturation of the ground, and the impact of groundwater flow, which are more prominent during elevated ambient temperatures. 5.2 ANN validation To begin with, the validation of the artificial neural network is analyzed by comparing the actual values and the predicted data obtained by the network for the purchased energy cost, as illustrated in Fig. 6 . Fig. 6(a-d) demonstrates the scatter plot that compares values predicted by an artificial neural network (designated as \u201cFit\u201d) with real points (labeled as \u201cData\u201d) for the training, validation, test, and all data. The perfect fit line, the point at which the output is equal to the target (Y = T), is also displayed as a reference. With a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.99916 for all data, the actual and anticipated values show strong agreement. The points on the scatter plot are highly concentrated near the line Y = T, indicating that the predicted values are extremely near to the actual values for the majority of the data points, indicating the model's accuracy. Any deviation of any point from the Y = T line indicates a prediction error, even with a strong correlation. These errors, however, are probably rather small and may fall within the acceptable range for the model's practical applicability, given the high R-value. Fig. 6(e) compares the ANN's forecast, \u201cOutput,\u201d with the actual observed values, \u201cTarget,\u201d for all data sets. Visual examination of the figure shows that the anticipated values roughly coincide with the actual data points, suggesting that the ANN model has successfully learned the true pattern. Fig. 7 demonstrates the error histogram, mean square error, and the validation check to assess the performance of the artificial neural network's training, testing, and validation data for the purchased energy cost. According to Fig. 7(a), more than 725 (60%) of all purchased energy cost data points have a minimum error (between −0.03 and + 0.03), proving the reliability of the developed artificial neural network. Fig. 7(b) illustrates the artificial neural network's learning procedure with mean square error as a performance indicator throughout several training epochs, the number of times the neural network passes the whole training dataset forward and backward. As shown, test, validation, and training errors reduce rapidly initially and then more slowly by increasing the epochs. According to the figure, the best validation performance is achieved at epoch 96 with the least mean square error of 0.0019 USD2, implying that the parameters at this stage are the most generalizable and ought to be applied to the final model. Fig. 7(c) presents the variation of validation failure with the number of training epochs. There are no validation failures for the majority of the training phase. During these time periods, the model either steadily gets better at what it is doing or keeps its performance on the validation dataset stable. A sudden increase at the end reveals that the model's ability to generalize begins to decline; therefore, the training must stop to avoid additional overfitting. As shown in Fig. 7(c), the phrase \u201cValidation check 6, at epoch 102\u201d means that by the 102nd epoch, the model has undergone six validation checks without any performance improvement. 6 Results and discussion After validating the system's components and neural network model, the performance assessment is conducted to assess the impact of key design variables on the main indicators, including the product energy, purchased energy costs, total cost, CO2 index, LCOE, and CO2 saving (section 6.1). Then, the performance of function fitting and cascade forward neural networks are evaluated and compared by analyzing their errors and computational time (section 6.2). Subsequently, the system is optimized from techno-environmental and economic points of view, applying four algorithms, including a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm, particle swarm, dragonfly, and grey wolf, to find the most optimal operating condition (section 6.3). Eventually, the design and optimal conditions are compared to see the optimization effectiveness and system performance under the optimal conditions over time (section 6.4). 6.1 Parametric analysis Fig. 8 demonstrates the variation of the product energy, purchased energy costs, total cost, CO2 index, LCOE, and CO2 saving with the borehole depth. According to the figure, since ground temperatures and the stability of thermal reservoirs tend to rise with depth, the positive slope of the product energy line indicates that geothermal energy extraction capacity generally increases with depth. The figure further indicates a decreasing slope of the purchased energy (heating+electricity), showing that the energy required from external networks reduces by around 500 USD with increasing borehole depth from 180 m to 300 m. Thus, a deeper borehole can meet a greater portion of the building's heating demand, cutting down on the need to purchase more energy. The figure, however, demonstrates that the overall cost, including investment and operations costs, rises directly to the drilling depth. This is unsurprising given the additional labor, time, and material requirements of drilling deeper boreholes. Choosing a deeper borehole increases the total cost from 441,000 USD to 545,000 USD. Likewise, the figure indicates that the increased costs spent at such depths are not offset by the extra energy obtained from drilling deeper. Therefore, the LCOE increases from 418 USD/MWh to 485 USD/MWh when the depth increases from 180 m to 300 m. Conversely, Fig. 8 shows that the CO2 index decreases by about 2.50 kg/MWh when the depth increases. This makes sense because more green energy is extracted from the borehole at higher depths, and the system uses less electricity to power auxiliary components and less heating from the district heating network, both of which can contribute to decreased carbon emissions. Similarly, the figure shows that more borehole drilling increases the potential of saving carbon dioxide by more than 3.5 t, illustrating the role of the proposed deep green technology in jumping toward the green transition process. These conflictive changes among the desirable objectives and unfavorable indicators signify the role of multi-objective optimization to ascertain a condition where all metrics are satisfied. Fig. 9 analyzes the effect of the number of boreholes on the system performance from all points of view. According to this pattern, a geothermal system's energy output increases cumulatively when adding more boreholes. This is rational because more boreholes improve the system's overall ability to produce heat or cooling energy. The boreholes exhibit consistent performance as indicated by the linear progression, which suggests that each borehole contributes nearly equally to the overall energy product. According to Fig. 9, as the number of boreholes rises, the cost of purchased energy is trending downward. This trend may suggest that as the number of boreholes increases, the geothermal system's internal energy production capability also climbs. This decreases the need for energy from outside sources and lowers the total cost of bought energy. The figure further reveals that despite the operational cost reduction, the investment cost goes up (≈126,000 USD) if additional boreholes are added to the geothermal system. This is explained by the fact that drilling, installing, and maybe maintaining more boreholes will cost more money. The figure further shows that the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) rises by about 86 USD/MWh in tandem with the number of boreholes increasing from 18 to 32. According to this trend, drilling additional boreholes may result in a higher overall energy output but at a higher cost per unit of energy. That's why the system decision parameters must be optimized to balance the energy cost and production. Finally, the figure illustrates that the system's environmental condition is improved when more boreholes are installed. As depicted, the CO2 emission index reduces by more than 2.60 kg/MWh, and the CO2 saving goes up by about 3.80 t by installing more boreholes (from 18 to 32). The air supply temperature going into the offices from the air handling unit is a key design parameter that impacts the borehole operation and its interaction with the district heating network and the process of the proposed smart controllers. For this, Fig. 10 assesses the effect of the air inlet temperature on the product energy, purchased energy costs, total cost, CO2 index, LCOE, and CO2 saving. According to the figure, the demand for heating from the district heating network to run the radiators decreases as the air supply temperature increases from 17 °C to 21 °C. Fig. 10 further reveals that the amount of energy purchased to heat a building decreases by about 2400 USD as the air entering the building gets warmer. This could be because the building automatically uses less supplemental heat when the air is already at a higher temperature. It shows how effectively the air handling unit is used, as optimizing the supply air temperature can save a lot of money by lowering the need for external energy sources. The figure further demonstrates that the increment of the air supply temperature results in higher total costs. At first glance, this relationship could seem illogical because one might anticipate that lower supply temperatures would result in less heating demand and cheaper costs. However, this increasing trend is due to the cooling demand increment in summer, requiring a bigger chilled beam to maintain indoor air at the desired temperature. Additionally, the size of heating coils in the air handling units increases when the supply air temperature increases, resulting in an increment in investment cost. According to the figure, the CO2 emission index increases by more than 1.60 kg/MWh when the supply temperature rises due to reducing product energy, which is the denominator of the emission index equation. Additionally, the figure shows that changing the supply temperature does not affect the CO2 saving. According to the figure, by raising the supply air temperature, the LCOE increases considerably by more than 80 $/MWh, which is unfavorable. This is reasonable because the product energy decreases and simultaneously increases the total cost. Fig. 10 emphasizes how crucial it is to optimize air handling unit performance for comfort and performance improvement while reducing cost and pollution. Fig. 11 presents the effect of the difference in the effectiveness of the rotary heat exchangers as a key parameter on the system performance from all facets, including techno-environmental and economic points of view. Meanwhile, the effectiveness difference of zero shows the design operation; there are −10% and 10% differences, with the design condition having −0.10 and 0.10 variations, respectively. According to the figure, the product energy falls from around 1200 MWh to 1015 MWh, while the difference in the rotary heat exchanger's effectiveness goes from −0.10 to 0.10. This implies that less energy is required from the district heating network and borehole to produce the heating or cooling demands. Practically speaking, this could imply that a heat exchanger with higher efficiency is extracting more heat from exhaust air, which would eliminate the need for additional heating and cooling sources. Furthermore, Fig. 11 indicates that the purchased energy cost in USD drops from 52,000 to 41,000 by improving the rotary heat exchanger's performance. The decreasing trend indicates that the operational energy costs fall as the heat exchanger becomes more efficient, resulting in cost savings. The figure further demonstrates that from somewhat under 587,000 to about 507,000, the overall cost drops dramatically when the effectiveness differences rise from −1 to approximately 0.02. The heat exchanger may recover more heat, meaning less energy is being used, and operational expenses are going down. When the effectiveness difference goes over 0.02 again, the pattern turns around, and the total cost starts to climb again. This can be because the decrease in operational expenses isn't enough to cover the increased investment costs of the more advanced equipment needed for greater waste heat recovery. There is a U-shaped relationship between the effectiveness difference and the LCOE, as seen in Fig. 11. Increasing the effectiveness difference from −1 to −0.20 means the LCOE falls from 491 USD/MWh to 462 USD/MWh, signifying that the total cost reduction exceeds the product energy decrement. However, the LCOE starts to rise significantly by more than 60 USD/MWh when the effectiveness goes up to 0.10. It is rational because the total cost increases and the product energy decreases simultaneously. Finally, the figure shows that choosing a more efficient rotary heat exchanger (higher effectiveness difference) results in better environmental conditions because of the CO2 index reduction of 3 kg/MWh, as illustrated in the figure. It makes sense since less energy is bought from the network, resulting in reduced carbon used thanks to the efficient waste heat recovery process as a passive energy improvement tactic. 6.2 ANN analysis By adjusting proper training techniques, it is possible to drastically alter the computing time and mean square error performance of artificial neural networks. How well an ANN learns from data depends on the chosen training algorithm. Fig. 12 compares the performance of different training algorithms by assessing their impact on the computational time and the mean square error of the purchased energy cost using a cascade-forward neural network. Of the algorithms shown, gradient descent is the quickest. It's a first-order optimization algorithm, which means it's quick and easy to use, but it could take longer for complicated problems to converge to the global minimum. The figure further shows that the Bayesian Regularization algorithm requires the greatest time to complete. Using a probabilistic approach, Bayesian Regularization can frequently produce a more resilient model with improved generalizability; nevertheless, the computer time required to perform complex calculations increases. While slower than the majority of the algorithms shown in the figure, Levenberg-Marquardt is quicker than Bayesian Regularization. It has a memory-intensive technique that approximates the Hessian matrix, yet it converges fast for small to medium-sized problems. It is essential to think about the costs and benefits of computing time against the mean square error. While basic Gradient Descent and other faster algorithms may be more efficient, they may not be as accurate. On the other hand, Bayesian Regularization and other slower methods may produce more correct models, but they are more computationally expensive. Thus, considering the application's unique requirements, the available computer resources, and the desired accuracy level determines the algorithm to be used. In order to train the model and perform the optimization, Levenberg-Marquardt is selected due to a least mean square error of 0.002 USD2 and simultaneously an acceptable computational time of 0.24 s compared to other algorithms. Fig. 13 demonstrates the variation of the mean square error of purchased energy cost by applying function-fitting and cascade-forward neural networks using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to analyze the effect of network architecture and the number of hidden neurons. According to the figure, both networks have a common pattern where the mean square error decreases as the number of hidden neurons rises. This is common because the network's ability to recognize intricate patterns in the data can be enhanced by including more neurons. In addition, Fig. 13 shows that both the cascade-forward and function-fitting neural networks perform competitively when there are varying numbers of hidden neurons. However, in the majority of instances, the cascade-forward neural network seems to have a marginally lower error. This makes sense because of its distinct architecture, which uses the outputs of each layer as inputs for every layer that comes after it. Opening up more channels for the error signal during training may enable the network to discover more intricate links and patterns in the data, which could lead to a lower mean square error. The figure also demonstrates that the growth in mean square error becomes less substantial or even plateaus after a certain number of neurons. The lowest error for both networks reaches about 10 hidden neurons. 6.3 Algorithm selection Following a detailed parametric assessment and finding the best neural network architecture, training algorithm, and the optimum number of hidden neurons, a comparative multi-objective optimization is conducted in MTLAB applying popular algorithms like particle swarm, grey wolf, dragonfly, and non-dominated sorting Genetic algorithm. Fig. 14 illustrates the Pareto frontier diagram of the main techno-environmental and economic indicators. CO2 index, product energy, and LCOE are chosen as the objective functions due to the trade-offs observed in parametric analysis by changing the key design variables. When considering all objectives, points on the Pareto frontier are optimal since no other solutions are better. When improving one goal without a corresponding deterioration in another objective is impossible, we say that the solution is on the Pareto frontier. These \u2018Pareto optimum\u2019 solutions are vital because they give the decision-maker a range of options. Investors can choose a solution that fits their priorities or limitations because each location on the frontier presents a unique trade-off among the objectives. One multi-criteria decision-making approach that ranks alternatives according to their distances to an ideal solution is TOPSIS, which is used in this paper. Before applying TOPSIS, the decision matrix must be normalized in order to compare various criteria on an equal basis. The next step is determining each criterion's best- (ideal) and worst-case scenarios. Each possible solution is given a relative distance between the best and worst options via TOPSIS, expressed as a proximity coefficient. The one with the greatest proximity coefficient is chosen for each given set of options. This approach is popular because it is easy to understand and implement, and options are ranked clearly according to how near they are to the ideal solution. Fig. 14 shows the optimal point distribution of each algorithm's CO2 index, product energy, and LCOE, distributed between 30 and 38 kg/MWh, 1042\u20131347 MWh, and 300\u2013460 $/MWh, respectively. The figure further shows the TOPSIS point corresponding to the genetic algorithm. In order to compare the optimization algorithms better, the ranking of optimal points obtained by the TOPSIS method is illustrated in Fig. 15 . Algorithms with more ideal points close to the lower ranking number have a larger area, making them the best. The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm works better due to the bigger area below rank 100. The figure further shows that the grey wolf optimizer could be the second-best algorithm due to a better distribution of the optimal points near low ranks. Eventually, the figure reveals that the dragonfly algorithm is not a proper option from the TOPSIS point of view since most of the optimum points have a rank of more than 300. Table 5 compares the key design parameters, objective functions, and the main indicators at the design condition and TOPSIS point obtained by the genetic algorithm to present the optimization power to achieve a more desirable condition by satisfying conflictive objectives simultaneously. According to the table, multi-objective optimization results in higher product energy of 120 MWh and lower LCOE and CO2 index of 57 $/MWh and 1.90 kg/MWh, respectively. This condition is achieved by choosing the borehole depth, number, and an effectiveness difference of 228 m, 29, and 0.01. Also, the table shows that the supply temperature of the district heating, air entering the offices, and air going into the restaurant should be 71 °C, 17 °C, and 17.10 °C. Additionally, the table shows a reduction in investment cost, total cost, and payback period by about 25,740 $, 15,021 $, and 1.20 years and an increment in CO2 saving by around 0.60 t, clarifying how optimization can achieve a condition where the system performance from techno-environmental and economic condition is enhanced. Fig. 16 illustrates the scatter distribution of the key decision variables, including the depth and number of the boreholes, district heating supply temperature, the temperature of the air entering the offices and the restaurant, and the effectiveness difference of the rotary heat exchangers. The dispersion of these optimal points allows designers and engineers to determine which variables have the most important impact on the performance, considering LCOE, product energy, and CO2 index as objectives. A further benefit is that it assists in comprehending the degree to which the objective functions are sensitive to variations in the key variables. If the optimal points are dispersed across the entire domain, then the variable is considered insensitive or non-influential. The opposite is true if the optimal points are near a sensitive parameter value; changing this parameter greatly impacts the objective functions. According to Fig. 16, changing the district heating supply and air temperature entering the offices significantly affects the system performance because all optimal points are close to 75 °C and 17 °C, respectively. The figure further demonstrates that changing the rotary heat exchanger's effectiveness difference does not influence the system because the ideal points are spread throughout the entire range. Additionally, it could be observed that the optimal points of the depth and number of boreholes are in the whole range while most are adjacent to 280 m and 31. Finally, the figure presents the distribution of the optimal points of the supply air temperature entering the restaurant, with the majority being close to 17.10 °C. 6.4 System performance under the best optimal condition Following a comprehensive parametric assessment and comparative optimization, the performance under the optimal condition is evaluated to analyze how the system operates over the year. Fig. 17 depicts the transient performance of the borehole thermal energy storage under optimal conditions. While Fig. 17(a) indicates the monthly, seasonal, and annual energy, either heating or cooling, produced by the boreholes, the hourly time duration curve of the heating stored in or transferred from the boreholes is presented in Fig. 17(b). As shown, the seasonal patterns substantially impact the quantity of heat stored or removed at different periods of the year, and the operational dynamics of boreholes are intimately tied to these trends. According to Fig. 17(a), the maximum useful energy of 83.3 MWh is obtained in summer. This makes sense because the sun's rays are at their strongest and longest, resulting in higher ground temperature, making it easier for the borehole to extract the cooling. Fig. 17(a) further indicates that the highest and lowest monthly energy productions of 23.80 MWh and 17.10 MWh were achieved in August and October, respectively. Fig. 17(b) presents the duration curve to observe the temporal distribution of the heating and cooling production over the year and better reflect the seasonal characteristics of borehole thermal energy storage designed to store heat during summer (cooling season) and release it in winter (heating season). According to the figure, a sharp early fall indicates that the boreholes are heated significantly during a small proportion of the hours that constitute peak cooling demand. There appears to be a more constant baseline level of cooling throughout the summer as the curve flattens out, indicating that most hours have a far lower heat transfer rate. In contrast, a long tail with a lower magnitude at a high level during the heating season demonstrates a relatively constant value of heating demand most of the year. According to Fig. 17(b), while the borehole generates cooling with the maximum hourly value of 154 kWh for almost 2778 h of the year (31.70%), it has the capacity for heating production for about 5820 h (66.40% of the year). Understanding this curve provides valuable information about the performance and thermal dynamics of the system over time, making it an essential tool for analyzing and managing borehole thermal energy storage. In order to investigate the share of each source, either borehole or district heating network, and energy wheels of air handling units on the total thermal demand, Fig. 18 illustrates and compares the heating and cooling generated by the boreholes and the heating transferred from and recovered by the district heating and energy wheels. According to the figure, the borehole's production (heating and cooling) is rather steady compared to the other sources, suggesting that it may operate consistently throughout the year. It seems to contribute the least of the three, though. The figure further indicates a lot of variance in the district heating. Some peaks might line up with times when people need heating more, like December and February, with the purchased heat of 124 MWh and 114 MWh. Besides, the figure shows that waste heat recovery via the energy wheel significantly contributes to the total heating and cooling demand as a passive energy improvement strategy. Also, it could be observed that the value of energy recovery in colder months is considerably higher than in summer due to the lower demand and effectiveness in warmer months. In essence, the figure shows an efficient plan to strike a compromise between renewable energy sources (such as boreholes), the reliability of district heating, and the effectiveness of an energy wheel to employ various sources for heating and cooling. This may be a component of a smart energy system that seeks to minimize emissions and energy costs while optimizing energy use. Fig. 19 presents the chord diagram of the investment cost to analyze and compare the share of each component on the total cost when the system is optimized considering the CO2 index, product energy, and LCOE simultaneously. Compared to the other components, the investment in boreholes is quite substantial. The intricate drilling procedures, considerable borehole depths, and installation all contribute to the hefty price. The figure further illustrates that the chilled beam with a capital cost of 79,295 USD is the second important component from the point of view of initial expenses. The energy wheel's moderate investment cost (51,184 USD) highlights its function in improving energy efficiency, especially in regions with extreme temperatures, by gradually improving ventilation efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Finally, the figure illustrates that from the total investment cost of 382,500 USD under the optimal condition, 11,095 USD corresponds to the heat exchangers and other components, including smart valves, pumps, and controllers. When assessing the financial feasibility of smart building energy systems, payback time and net present value are critical metrics, especially when it comes to renewable energy installations and sustainable building designs. The payback period provides a clear evaluation of investment risk by calculating the period needed for an investment to generate cash flows big enough to cover its initial cost. Generally speaking, investors find shorter payback times more alluring since they indicate a speedier return on investment and free up funds for other endeavors. However, net present value offers a more complete picture by discounting future cash flows back to their present value and evaluating an investment's profitability over its full life. When accounting for the time worth of money, a system with a positive net present value is anticipated to produce greater prosperity than was initially invested. Fig. 20 compares the net present value and the payback time between design and optimal conditions over 20 years. According to the figure, despite high investment costs of 408,240 USD and 382,500 USD at the design and optimal conditions, the proposed system offers long-term benefits in terms of reduced operational costs and minimal payback period, aligning well with the principles of the future smart energy system with the lowest pollution and being affordable. As depicted, the net present value of zero, which is the payback time, decreases by about 1.20 years thanks to the multi-objective optimization. 7 Conclusion The present work introduces a new efficient smart building energy system to deal with important unsolved issues in the literature, including high investment/operational costs of geothermal-driven systems and the lack of an intelligent control framework for higher renewable integration while minimizing components' size. The fundamental concept involved here is deep green cooling and heating equipped with a dynamic control design through several intelligent valves and controllers, which involves drilling into the ground to meet the demands without machinery or heat pumps. TRNSYS analyzes the system's performance from all aspects, while ANN helps with optimization as part of MATLAB's machine-learning process. In order to determine which ANN design and training algorithm performs best with the least amount of error and the least amount of computing time, a thorough comparison is conducted. In addition, the popular optimization algorithms based on holistic approaches\u2014such as the non-dominated sorting genetic, grey wolf, dragonfly, and particle swarm\u2014are evaluated and compared to determine the optimal trade-off through the TOPSIS decision-making technique. Eventually, the primary indicators from techno-economic and environmental aspects are calculated under ideal conditions to determine how well the system performs throughout the year. The following are the key conclusions of the parametric comparison: \u2022 While deeper boreholes increase the capacity of geothermal energy extraction and lower CO2 emissions and bought energy needs, deep drilling becomes more costly overall and does not result in commensurate energy cost savings. \u2022 The system's energy output and environmental advantages grow when more boreholes are added since they lower CO2 emissions. However, this also raises the overall costs because drilling and installation are more expensive; therefore, optimization is required to strike a balance between costs and techno-environment benefits. \u2022 Although it necessitates careful management of related costs and operational issues, optimizing the air supply temperature and the efficiency of rotary heat exchangers can substantially impact system performance, decreasing energy costs and CO2 emissions through improved efficiency. The following is a summary of the primary optimization results: \u2022 The chosen training methods greatly affect the accuracy and efficiency of artificial neural networks. Algorithms like Levenberg-Marquardt provide the best compromise between computing time and error minimization. \u2022 Because more ideal points are rated below 100, the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm is shown to be the most efficient from the TOPSIS point of view. Since most of the dragonfly algorithm's optimal points are ranked higher than 300 by the TOPSIS technique, it is deemed less acceptable for optimization of the proposed system. \u2022 At the best optimal point obtained by the genetic algorithm, higher product energy of 120 kW/m2 and lower LCOE, payback period, and CO2 index of 57 $/MWh, two years, and 1.90 kg/MWh are achieved compared to the design condition. Selecting a borehole depth of 228 m, a number of 29, and an effectiveness difference of rotary heat exchanger of 0.01, respectively, fulfills this requirement. In addition, it is recommended that supply temperatures for the district heating, office air, and restaurant air be 71 °C, 17 °C, and 17.10 °C, respectively. Here are the key takeaways from the transient analysis under the optimal condition: \u2022 August has the largest monthly energy output at 23.80 MWh, while October has the lowest at 17.10 MWh, demonstrating how the system is sensitive to seasonal variations. With a maximum hourly production of 154 kWh, the system proves its worth during summer's peak cooling demand, providing cooling for about 2778 h, or 31.70% of the year, while sustaining heating production for around 5820 h, showing a strong capacity to fulfill heating demands in the winter. \u2022 As a passive energy improvement technique, the energy wheel's waste heat recovery substantially contributes to the overall demand for heating and cooling. The analysis shows how to effectively balance using renewable energy sources (such as boreholes), the dependability of district heating, and the efficiency of energy wheels in a smart energy system that maximizes waste energy while lowering emissions and energy costs. \u2022 Although the design and optimal conditions have high initial investment costs (408,240 USD and 382,500 USD, respectively), the analysis shows that the system is financially beneficial in the long run due to reduced operational costs and a short payback period. This aligns with the goals of sustainable and smart energy systems, which are to reduce pollution and increase affordability.

It includes an intelligent control strategy for lowering operational costs, making better use of renewables, and avoiding CO2 emissions by eliminating heat pumps and cooling machines to address the heating and cooling demands of a commercial building in Uppsala, a city near Stockholm, Sweden. After comprehensively conducting techno-environmental and economic assessments, the system is fine-tuned using artificial neural networks (ANN) for optimization. The study aims to determine which ANN design and training procedure is the most efficient in terms of accuracy and computing speed. It also assesses well-known optimization algorithms using the TOPSIS decision-making technique to find the best trade-off among various indicators. According to the parametric results, deeper boreholes can collect more geothermal energy and reduce CO2 emissions. However, deep drilling becomes more expensive overall, suggesting the need for multi-objective optimization to balance costs and techno-environmental benefits. The results indicate that Levenberg-Marquardt algorithms offer the optimum trade-off between computation time and error minimization. From a TOPSIS perspective, while the dragonfly algorithm is not ideal for optimizing the suggested system, the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm is the most efficient since it yields more ideal points rated below 100. The optimization yields a higher energy production of 120 kWh/m2, as well as a decreased levelized cost of energy of 57 $/MWh, a shorter payback period of two years, and a reduced CO2 index of 1.90 kg/MWh. The analysis reveals that despite the high investment costs of 382.50 USD/m2, the system is financially beneficial in the long run due to a short payback period of around eight years, which aligns with the goals of future smart energy systems: reduce pollution and increase cost-effectiveness.",
