No135 Yaguan Road Haihe Education Area Jinnan District Tianjin University BeiYangYuan Campus School of Mechanical Engineering Tianjin University China Applications of electric heating, which can improve carbon emission reduction and renewable energy utilization, have brought new challenges to the safe operation of energy systems around the world. Regenerative electric heating with load aggregators and demand response is an effective means to mitigate the wind curtailment and grid operational risks caused by electric heating. However, there is still a lack of models related to demand response, which results in participants not being able to obtain maximum benefits through dynamic subsidy prices. This study uses the Weber\u2013Fechner law and a clustering algorithm to construct quantitative response characteristics models. The deep Q network was used to build a dynamic subsidy price generation framework for load aggregators. Through simulation analysis based on the evolutionary game model of a project in a rural area in Tianjin, China, the following conclusions were drawn: compared with the benchmark model, regenerative electric heating users can save up to 8.7% of costs, power grid companies can save 56.6% of their investment, and wind power plants can increase wind power consumption by 17.6%. The framework proposed in this study considers user behavior quantification of demand response participants and the differences among users. Therefore, the framework can provide a more reasonable, applicable, and intelligent system for regenerative electric heating.

Many countries or regions worldwide, such as China [2], Europe [3], and California [4], have set carbon emission reduction targets to be achieved by the mid-21st century. Heating electrification can prompt a 30\u201340% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions [1]. Electric heating has therefore become an important focus in efforts to achieve clean heating [5] and increase wind power consumption [6] across the world. However, owing to the large heating load and fluctuations in external weather conditions, electric heating significantly impacts the safe operation of the power grid. Relevant research in the UK shows that electric heating can lead to an increase of more than 30% in peak power consumption in winter [7]. Thus, certain measures should be taken to ensure power quality [8]. Currently, there are two main solutions to this problem: demand response (DR) to prompt users to actively reduce loads and regenerative electric heating to achieve peak-load shifting. Using the electric heating load as a DR source has become an attractive option [9]. With the increasing maturity of the power market, price-based DR may appeal to users participating in load regulation. A regenerative electric boiler can convert electricity into heating and is an effective way of solving the problem of abandoned wind power and smoothing the demand curves of the thermal load [10]. Li et al. [11] used the heat retainer of the district heating network and aggregated buildings, increased the flexibility of the electricity system, and effectively promoted wind power integration. However, unlike the fixed-load response behavior of centralized industrial and commercial users, the DR of the electric heating load of rural residential buildings is more autonomous and random [12]. The randomness of small users also causes the heat retainer not to effectively absorb wind power and achieve peak-load shifting. In response to these problems, researchers have proposed a method of using load aggregators (LAs) to aggregate small users to interact with the power grid [13] and wind power plants [14]. However, how LAs, as intermediary service providers, can assist in the completion of DR in regenerative electric heating while obtaining benefits is the key problem. Current research on LA and DR has achieved satisfactory results for electric load [15]. Since the DR of regenerative electric heating load needs to consider more factors (e.g., the safe range of room temperature), the electric heating load is more complicated than the electric load. Chen et al. [9] proposed a multi-objective optimization model that optimizes the economy and comfort index for the electric heating load. Callaway et al. [16] suggested that the simulation and control of the heating load with a suitable model can more flexibly complete the DR of the electric heating load. Subsidies for users to participate in regenerative electric heating DR should also be considered, but currently, they are mostly fixed values [6]. Table 1 presents details of related previous research. According to the results presented in Table 1, it is feasible to realize the DR of heating systems through electric heating or heat retainers. Combining these two technologies can effectively achieve operating cost savings or system flexibility improvements. If they are used simultaneously, renewable energy consumption, such as wind power, could also increase. It should also be noted that some studies did not construct a plan that included LAs, as such studies usually ignore the differences between individual users. However, the differences between users should be considered during the operation phase to motivate user participation in DR. To clearly show the current status of related research and the positioning of this paper, Fig. 1 shows a Venn diagram of previous correlation research regarding heating systems with DR. Current research still cannot solve the problem of promoting DR while increasing the interests of all parties. However, the economy and continuity of system operation are the key to promoting regenerative electric heating [27]. Existing research has neglected the following aspects in the field of electric heating DR: (1) The quantified model of user response behavior in the simulation phase is not consistent with actual response behavior, which makes it impossible to present LAs with a reference for setting dynamic subsidy prices. (2) The subsidy prices that LAs offer users who participate in electric heating DR are usually fixed values [28]. A study in Sweden showed that dynamic prices can effectively guide changes in electric heating load [26]. The existing method cannot achieve dynamic pricing based on the process of user participation in electric heating DR. Therefore, it is difficult to improve the safety of the actual project under conditions of a large increase in the electric heating load. In addition, it is difficult to maximize the interest of LAs to increase the continuity of the DR. For the first problem, user response behavior is generated by user characteristics under the stimulation of external price parameters. To quantify this process, it is necessary to understand the psychological impact of external stimuli. This process can be calculated by assuming a linear user response to price incentives [29]. However, according to neuroscience-related research, the relationship between mental and physical quantities seems to be logarithmic rather than linear [30]. The Weber\u2013Fechner law can realize the quantitative transformation of mental quantity into physical quantity [31]. There has been a certain amount of progress made in human taste quantification [32], visual quantification [33], and behavior quantification [34]. Therefore, the Weber\u2013Fechner law is suitable for quantifying user DR behavior characteristics. With this method, the response characteristics of each user can be quantified. However, electric heating users are grouped. Therefore, it is necessary to summarize the response characteristics of user groups according to the response characteristics of individual users. The clustering algorithm can be used to quantify the response behavior of user groups. From a data analysis perspective, there are many methods of performing cluster analysis of data sets. Nonetheless, in the operation phase, the LA will decide whether to divide users into several categories, based on management convenience. Therefore, the k-means algorithm for clustering based on Euclidean distance and a given number of centers is one of the more appropriate and popular methods used [35]. To ensure that the process of user participation in the DR is more realistic, this study introduces an evolutionary game mechanism in the simulation analysis. Thus, the dynamic process of adding groups with different response characteristics to the demand response can be analyzed [36]. Traditional optimization and control methods have difficulty addressing the second problem. The future of DR development and implementation greatly depends on incorporating user feedback in its control loop [37]. Reinforcement learning algorithms based on dynamic interactions and evaluative feedback do not require forecasting models for their availability, unlike traditional methods (e.g., particle swarm optimization, genetic algorithm, and fuzzy logic controllers) [38]. In addition, when combined with deep learning, reinforcement learning can continuously learn, achieving continuous evolution [39]. In recent years, reinforcement learning algorithms (e.g., Q learning) have been considered effective optimization methods in the field of DR [37]. However, there is still little research in dynamic pricing for customers [15], especially in electric heating DR. Besides, electric heating can have a wide price range, which makes the iterative computation of Q learning more costly and the convergence of the training process more difficult [40]. Using a deep neural network (DNN) to take on the role of the action-value matrix can be considered a solution. Google applied a deep Q network (DQN) to train agents to solve the Atari 2600 game and successfully surpassed human-level skills [41]. Under such an approach, the DQN is considered groundbreaking work in the field of reinforcement learning. This study uses the DQN to complete the construction of the dynamic pricing model. This study reports results of a regenerative electric heating project with LAs in rural areas of Tianjin, China. The framework constructed in this study could provide a valuable reference for regenerative electric heating projects worldwide. The main contributions of this study can be summarized as follows: (1) Aiming toward the DR of regenerative electric heating users, response characteristics are quantified through Weber\u2013Fechner law using a more accurate method. A clustering algorithm is used to extract group response characteristics from individual user response characteristics. (2) The dynamic process of users is analyzed with different response characteristics joining DR through the evolutionary game model. Weber\u2013Fechner law combined with evolutionary game models can accumulate pre-training data for actual operations. (3) A deep reinforcement learning framework with a DQN is built to realize dynamic user subsidy price generation. The DQN can update itself based on new data to improve accuracy. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The system and entity models are introduced in Section 2. Section 3 shows the quantitative user response model, including the user response characteristics and evolutionary game model. Section 4 describes the deep reinforcement learning framework for generating dynamic subsidy prices. Sections 5 presents the results and discussion of the case study. Finally, Section 6 outlines our main conclusions. 2 Model description 2.1 System model overview Traditional electric loads are usually higher during the day and lower at night. Although wind power follows no obvious fluctuation law, power generation is usually higher at night when the electricity load is low [42]. Because of these wind power characteristics, when the power exceeds the power consumption limit, wind power will be prohibited from being connected to the grid [43]. Increasing power consumption when wind power generation is high is one of the best methods to address the wind curtailment problem. Electricity-to-heat equipment is an effective way to increase electricity consumption at night [44]. A feasible implementation is to encourage users to increase power consumption by signing preferential power purchase contracts between wind farms and users [45]. Users who participate in DR during the price discount period are eligible for discounts by increasing their electricity consumption. The power grid management allows the wind power that is equal to the additional electricity consumption to be transmitted to the grid. Wind farms can also benefit from this additional electricity consumption. In the electricity consumption scenario presented in this study, wind farms and users participate in power transactions, and the power grid is responsible for power transmission. Wind farms have independent autonomy as operating enterprises and can negotiate preferential prices with users. The scenario constructed in this study is limited, so the LA described is only one of the customers contracted with the wind farm. As of 2016, the total installed capacity of wind power in Tianjin reached 323 MW. It is expected to reach 1160 MW when the 13th Five-Year Plan is completed [46]. Therefore, this study does not constrain the capacity of wind farms. (1) Benchmark model The existing electric heating market includes the power grid, power supply (including renewable energy), and heat users (Fig. 2 ). Regenerative electric heating systems in northern China typically conduct centralized transformation for users in a certain area and a complete heat supply through electric boilers [5]. Heat users pay electricity bills based on the electricity used for heating. Wind power is mainly consumed for heating at night. Because the peak heat load of electric heating overlaps with the peak electric load, electricity distribution companies need to invest a significant amount of money to increase the grid capacity. (2) Demand response model As an intermediary service provider, LAs can interact with power grids and wind farms for small-scale electric heating users and assist users to complete DR and obtain revenue. Simultaneously, stored heat can be used to shift the peak load and absorb wind power, which reduces wind curtailment and ensures the safe operation of the power grid. The structure of the regenerative electric heating DR model is shown in Fig. 3 . In the DR model, the power grid provides incentives to the LA to encourage them to help reduce the peak load. Part of the incentive money will become a subsidy price to heat users to encourage them to participate in the DR and actively reduce their heating load through the user response behavior model. The remaining part of the incentive money becomes the revenue of the LA. During peak hours, to ensure that the power load does not exceed the safety capacity of the power grid, the power grid management department requires entities involved in DR to reduce their load. Heat users participating in DR will reduce their own heating load. In addition, the LA can turn off the electric boiler at this time and use the heat in the heat retainer for heat supply and load reduction. The subsidy price is dynamically generated by the LA using the DQN. The user response behavior model is constructed using Weber\u2013Fechner law and a clustering algorithm. The dynamic process of user participation in the DR is simulated by the evolutionary game model in this study. 2.2 Entity model 2.2.1 Wind farm In the benchmark model, wind power consumption comes from the heat load of the users at night. After joining the LA and adopting regenerative electric heating, the increased consumption of the wind farm comes from the heat stored in the heat retainer at night. The wind power consumption F W , i and revenue of the wind farm E W , i can be expressed as follows: (1) F W , i = ∑ m = 1 M L m , i + ( L C , i - L DC , i ) · Δ t , (2) E W , i = P W , i · F W , i , where m is the number of users, m = 1, 2, 3\u2026M; L m , i is the user electric heating load, kW; L C , i is the amount of heat stored at the time i (0 in the benchmark model), kW; L D C , i is the amount of heat released at the time i (0 in the benchmark model), kW; Δ t is the time interval, h; and P W , i is the wind power price, CNY/kWh. 2.2.2 Electric heating users According to the benchmark model, users only need to pay electricity bills based on their heating load. After joining the LA, users can participate in DR and receive subsidies by actively reducing their heating load. The cost of user m at time i is as follows: (3) E U , i = P i · ( L m , i - L X , m , i ) - P B , i · L X , m , i · Δ t , where P B , i is the peak-shaving subsidy given to users by LA, CNY/kWh; P i is the municipal electricity heating price, CNY/kWh; and L X , m , i is the reduction of the user heating load (0 in the benchmark model), kW. 2.2.3 Power grid company As in the benchmark model, owing to the addition of the electric heating load, the electrical load at peak times further increases. Therefore, the management department of the power grid needs to invest in increasing the capacity of the grid to ensure safe operation. Regenerative electric heating that joins LAs can reduce the peak load through the storage/release of the heat retainer and DR. Thus, a part of the incentive subsidy is spent to improve grid security and reduce expansion costs. The electrical load of area F G , i at time i and the cost of the grid E G [47] can be expressed as follows: (4) F G , i = ∑ m = 1 M ( L m , i - L X , m , i ) + ( L C , i - L DC , i ) · Δ t / η , (5) E G = β · max ( F G , i ) · σ ( 1 - α ) ( 1 - λ ) - ∑ i = 1 I P R , i · ( ∑ m = 1 M L X , m , i + L DC , i ) · Δ t , where η is the conversion efficiency of electric heating, β is the capacity cost conversion factor, CNY/(kW∙a); α is the power distribution loss coefficient; λ is the system reserve capacity coefficient; σ is the simultaneous user rate; P R , i is the peak-shaving subsidy given by the power grid to LA, CNY/kWh; and m a x ( F G , i ) is the maximum heating load during peak periods. 2.2.4 Load aggregator The revenue of the LA comes from the subsidy rewards of the electricity distribution company and the heat release revenue of the heat retainer. The expenditure is the subsidy to the users and the heat storage cost. The revenue of the LA at time i is calculated as follows: (6) E LA , i = P R , i · ( ∑ m = 1 M L X , m , i + L DC , i ) + P i · L DC , i - P B , i · L X , i - P W , i · L C , i · Δ t , 2.3 Model constraint To ensure safety during the operation of electric heating, relevant constraints are constructed as described in this section. 2.3.1 Load aggregator constraints The LA needs to maintain the heat demand of the users for a certain time in the event of a power outage. Therefore, the following risk constraints should be considered: (1) Heat retainer capacity constraints To ensure user thermal comfort in the event of a power failure, the heat of the heat retainer cannot be completely released during peak shaving; a certain safety capacity, S m i n , should be reserved. (7) S min ⩽ S i ⩽ S max , (2) Heat storage/release constraints The storage/release power must be less than the rated power of the electric boiler. Storage and release cannot be performed at the same time. (8) 0 ⩽ ∑ m = 1 M N m , i ( L m , i - L X , m , i ) + ( u L DC , i + v L C , i ) ⩽ H P max u + v = 1 , u , v = 0 o r 1 , where HP m a x is the maximum heating power of the electric boiler, kW; and u and v are the coefficients used to ensure that storage and release are not performed simultaneously. (3) Capacity status constraints The capacity state of the heat retainer is restored to the initial state after one cycle of operation. (9) S start = S end , where S s t a r t is the initial state of the retainer for the cycle, and S e n d is the end state of the retainer for the cycle. (4) Electric boilers\u2019 conversion efficiency constraints There will be a certain energy loss during the heating process of the electric boiler. (10) L i = η · Δ t · H P i , where L i is the heat supplied by the electric boiler at time i, kW, and HP i is the power of the electric boiler at time i, kW. 2.3.2 User comfort constraints Users participating in DR can obtain subsidies by reducing their heat load during peak hours. In the heating specification, the lower limit of residential heating in winter is 18 °C. Therefore, the maximum heating load that users can reduce is the heat saved by adjusting the current indoor temperature to 18 °C, which is not used by all the users for DR because of the differences in their heat usage and consumption habits. Instead, users adjust their response ratio based on the subsidies given by the LA. Based on the response ratio Z, the user load reduction can be calculated (the response ratio is calculated using the Weber\u2013Fechner law.) (11) L X , m , i = Z · ( L now , m , i - L 18 , m , i ) , where L n o w , m , i is the load when maintaining the current indoor temperature, kW, and L 18 , m , i is the load when maintaining the indoor temperature at 18 °C, kW. In this study, a heat balance model was used to construct the heating load calculation model for demand-side electric heating users. The calculation method for the heating load involved in these models is presented in Appendix A. 3 Quantitative user response model 3.1 User response characteristics 3.1.1 Individual user response characteristics Weber\u2013Fechner law proposes that the intensity of psychological and physical stimulation is logarithmically proportional, which realizes the quantitative conversion of psychological to physical. The calculation method can be expressed as follows [31]: (12) Z = K ln R + C , where Z is the mental quantity, R is the physical stimulation, and K and C are characteristic coefficients. In other words, mental quantity is a logarithmic function of stimulation. When the stimulus intensity increases in geometric progression, the sensation intensity increases in arithmetic progression. Considering the individual differences between users, the response behavior of different users is different under the same price stimulus. However, for all users, the user response behavior presents a trend that the greater the stimulus, the stronger the user willingness to participate in the DR. The individual user response ratio Z is calculated as follows: (13) Z = K ln P B , i + C , 3.1.2 User group response characteristics 3.1.2.1 User response characteristics acquisition method During the operation of regenerative electric heating, it is possible to install a smart heat meter in each household to measure the indoor temperature and control the heat supply. Therefore, the user response model can be built into the smart heat meter to realize dynamic heat consumption adjustment based on changes in the user subsidy price given by the LA. Because the response characteristics of users are not the same, the LA cannot consider the characteristics of each user individually when setting the user subsidy price. Therefore, it is necessary to extract the typical characteristics of the user response model. Users can choose a typical model that meets their needs and build in their smart heat meters. To achieve this goal, typical response characteristics can be extracted from individual user response characteristics through a clustering algorithm. First, individual user response characteristics can be obtained through questionnaire surveys: (14) 0 = K ln P min + C 1 = K ln P max + C , where P m i n is the lowest expected price for the user to participate in the DR, P m i n ≥ 0.01 and P m a x is the highest expected price for the user to fully participate in the DR. When the subsidy price is lower than P m i n , users do not participate in the DR. When the subsidy price is higher than P m a x , the users fully participate in the DR. Through this questionnaire, the response characteristics coefficient of each user can be determined. Users can then be categorized using a clustering algorithm. 3.1.2.2 User response characteristics clustering method This study uses the k-means clustering method, which can divide the target data into the required categories [48]. First, the number of cluster centers K is determined. Then, cluster centers are randomly generated, the data are clustered into K categories, and the cluster centers are recalculated. Finally, the steps of clustering and generating data centers are repeated until the termination condition is met. The degree of user response at a given subsidy price is selected as the clustering data point. When clustering the data, the Euclidean distance between different data and cluster centers is calculated using Eq. (15). The data are classified into the category of the cluster center with the smallest Euclidean distance. (15) o k = arg min j x k - l n j 2 , where o ( k ) is the category to which the k-th group of data belongs, x ( k ) is the k-th group of data, and l n ( j ) is the j-th centroid of the n-th iteration. The method of forming a new cluster center is to calculate the mean value of all points in the data belonging to the same category and use the mean value as the new cluster center: (16) l n j = ∑ k = 1 y 1 o k = j x k ∑ k = 1 y 1 o k = j , The clustering steps can be listed as follows (Fig. 4 ): (a) Set the number of cluster centers, J; (b) Randomly generate J groups of data as the clustering center within the data change range, denoted as l 1 1 , l 1 2 , l 1 3 ⋯ l 1 J ; (c) Allocate the data to the nearest cluster center according to its Euclidean distance to the cluster center, forming a total of J groups; (d) According to the latest clustering situation, the center of J groups of data is calculated as the new cluster center, and the cluster center is updated to l 1 1 , l 1 2 , l 1 3 \u2026 l 1 J ; (e) Repeat until the clustering result does not change. 3.2 Evolutionary game model The process of electric heating user participation in the DR is gradually completed. Moreover, the proportion of users participating in the DR varies among different user groups. LAs can obtain higher returns if they can dynamically adjust the subsidy price according to user participation [13]. In the actual process, the user participation ratio can be directly obtained. This study uses an evolutionary game model to simulate the process of user participation in the DR. In the process of evolution, high-yield strategies are more likely to be adopted than low-yield strategies. In addition, low-yield users actively imitate high-yield user strategies to expect higher returns. Because users are not completely rational, their strategy changes continuously toward the optimal goal. In this study, the strategies that users can adopt are participation in the DR (S1) and no participation in the DR (S2). Assuming that there are two types of users, the evolutionary game process can be described as follows: In Table 2 , p S 1 represents the proportion of the user A group (hereafter \u201cuser A\u201d) that chooses S1; 1 - p S 1 represents the proportion of user A that chooses S2; q S 1 represents the proportion of the user B group (hereafter \u201cuser B\u201d) that chooses S1; 1 - q S 1 represents the proportion of user B that chooses strategy S2; a, b, c, and d are the revenue of user A under various strategies; and e, f, g, and h are the revenue of user B under various strategies. According to the evolutionary game matrix, an evolutionary dynamic equation set of the two groups of users who choose to participate in the DR (S1) is constructed: (17) q ̇ S 1 = q S 1 1 - q S 1 f - e + g - h p S 1 - g - h p ̇ S 1 = p S 1 1 - p S 1 a - c - a - c + d - b q S 1 , where q ̇ S 1 a n d p ̇ S 1 represent the proportions of the two types of users participating in DR in the next cycle. 4 Deep reinforcement learning framework for generating dynamic subsidy prices 4.1 Deep reinforcement learning model Formally, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a game between an agent and an environment. DRL can also be defined as the problem of learning how to act optimally in an environment through experience [49]. If an agent\u2019s action causes the environment to give a positive reward, the agent\u2019s subsequent tendency to execute this action will be reinforced [50]. The DRL algorithm used in this study is an effective tool for dynamic price setting after mastering the quantitative user DR model. The logical structure of reinforcement learning is shown in Fig. 5 . As the agent, the LA can interact with the environment composed of the models constructed in Section 3, and the revenue obtained by the LA is the reward. The agent generates an action, which is the subsidy given to the users by the aggregator, according to the state (the number of weeks, Nw, and the proportions of user A/B participating in DR, Pup_A/B). During the heating period, the LA can adjust the subsidy to the users once a week. Users can choose whether to participate in DR at the same time. Therefore, the key status of each step is the number of weeks and the proportion of users participating in the DR at that moment. The specific settings are presented in Table 3 . 4.2 Architecture of the deep Q network A value-function-based DRL is a type of DRL that uses DNNs for value function approximation [51]. Simple neural networks consist of an input layer and an output layer; when more layers are stacked, the networks are called deep. A DNN learns to perform particular tasks through training, during which the strength of connections between units is learned [52]. The DNN in this study was trained using historical data (composed of state, reward, and action) stored in the buffer. A certain amount of historical data can be stored in the buffer. When the buffer is full, the new input data replace the oldest data. Therefore, the agent can always refer to the latest data to generate policies. The DQN in this study used a DNN as a value function to output dynamic subsidy prices according to the input state. The operation mode of the DQN is shown in Fig. 6 . In this study, the Python 3.7 and TensorFlow 2.0 platform was used to complete the construction of the algorithm. The DNN uses a four-layer fully connected structure (including two 256-node hidden layers). The activation function is Relu, the error function is Huber, the optimizer is Adam, and the learning rate is 0.01. The weights are initialized from the normal distribution. The structure of the DNN is shown in Fig. 7 . The number of input layer nodes is the same as the number of elements in the state. The number of output layer nodes is consistent with the number of selectable actions. At each step, when the policy is generated, the DNN is fed with the state vector. Then, the DNN outputs the action. Finally, the reward and state of the next step are calculated. The flow chart is shown in Fig. 8 . The DRL algorithm used in this study is the DQN. The greed factor in the algorithm is set as a variable, as shown in Eq. (18). The pseudocode of this algorithm is shown in Algorithm 1. (18) ε = max ( 0.01 , ( 0.1 - 0.01 · e p i s o d e / e p o c h ) ) , where episode is the current iteration number of the algorithm, the value function will be updated every epoch steps, and epoch is 200.

As shown in Fig. 9, the simulation and practical application processes are essentially the same. Therefore, the framework can use the data in the simulation phase to guide operation. Simultaneously, data in the operation phase can also be used to update the value function. There are two main differences between the two parts (red boxes in Fig. 9): (1) The user DR during the operation phase is completed by the smart heat meter, but the built-in control model is consistent with the simulation process. (2) The proportion of users participating in the DR is calculated by the evolutionary game model in the simulation. In the operation phase, this value can be directly obtained by counting the number of people who have signed an agreement with the LA. There is therefore no difference between the two methods. A follow-up study will mainly focus on the simulation phase of the analysis. 5 Results and discussion 5.1 Model parameters The demonstration platform is located in a rural area in Tianjin, China. Four regenerative electric heating stations, located in Guozhuangzi, Dashawo, Xiaoshawo, and Zhongxinkou, were selected. The total heating area is 760,000 m2 and contains a total of 7593 residential houses. This study represents a strategy analysis before actual operation. However, it can provide pre-training data for the application of the deep learning framework. The research object of this study is 1000 residential houses (a single-house area of 100 m2 was selected according to the demonstration platform) in a rural area in Tianjin, China. They use central heating and are equipped with regenerative electric boilers and single-family smart heat meters. The heating cycle in this area in winter was 133 days (19 weeks). The indoor set temperature was 22 °C, and the minimum allowable temperature was 18 °C. All parameters were set according to the actual buildings. At the end of each week, the users and LA can adjust their strategies, i.e., whether to participate in the DR and adjust subsidy prices. The electricity consumption peak-load period is 7:00\u201311:00 and 18:00\u201321:00 every day. The LA can obtain a peak-shaving subsidy from the power grid company via load reduction during peak-load periods. The preferential power purchase periods signed by the wind farm and the LA are 1:00\u20136:00 and 22:00\u201323:00, respectively. Other parameters are listed in Tables 4 and 5 . 5.2 User heating load characteristics According to the heat balance model presented in Appendix A and the relevant model parameters in Table 4b, the heating load fluctuation of a single residential house can be calculated (the model is built in Python). However, owing to the different behaviors of users in the DR, the heating load of individual users will also differ, according to Eq. (11) The total heating load of the area is the sum of the heating loads of 1000 houses. The heating load characteristics of a single house on a single day in the heating cycle are shown in Fig. 10 . Fig. 10 shows that the heating load trend of a residential house and the outdoor temperature exhibit a negative correlation. The indoor room temperature is maintained at 22 °C when not in the DR period, and the heating load is relatively high (orange line). When DR is required, the user heating load can be adjusted within the gray area. However, to ensure the health of users, the real-time heating load will not be lower than the load that maintains an indoor temperature of 18 °C. The project carried out a 10-week heating test. The comparison between the actual measured heating load and the calculated value of the heat balance model every week is shown in Fig. 11 . The heating load of the four demonstration areas is scaled according to the ratio between the actual number of users and 1000. The maximum error between the calculated and measured heating load was 7.5%. Therefore, the subsequent calculations in this paper were completed using the heat balance model. 5.3 User response characteristics In actual regenerative electric heating, the user response characteristics are modeled through questionnaire surveys. This study simulates this process through random generation. Referring to the framework proposed in Fig. 9, the establishment of a model with practical reference value for user response characteristics is an important part of pre-training. (1) Random generation methods Since the valley price of electricity is 0.3 CNY/kWh, the subsidy prices were set between 0.01 and 0.30 CNY/kWh. The lowest expected price for the user to participate in the DR should be 0.01\u20130.12 CNY/kWh, and the highest expected price for the user to fully participate in DR should be above 0.1 CNY/kWh. Based on these conditions, the expected price was randomly generated between 0.01 and 0.30 CNY/kWh. The lowest expected price was normally distributed with a mean of 0.1 and a variance of 0.05. The highest expected price was normally distributed with a mean of 0.2 and a variance of 0.07. (2) Random generation methods The response characteristic coefficients were randomly generated for 1000 users and divided into two categories. The clustering curve is shown in Fig. 12 . There are two types of users (red lines in Fig. 12): Type A is price-sensitive; when the subsidy is 0.07 CNY/kWh, user A is willing to participate in the DR. When the subsidy reaches 0.17 CNY/kWh, user A fully participates in the DR. Type B is price-insensitive; user B is willing to participate in the DR only when the subsidy exceeds 0.12 CNY/kWh. When the subsidy reaches 0.25 CNY/kWh, user B fully participates in the response. The response characteristics equations can be expressed as follows: (19) Z A = 1.127 ln P B, i + 2.997 Z B = 1.362 ln P B, i + 2.889 . Users can choose which model to build into their smart heat meter. Suppose that 600 people chose the A model and the initial Pup_A was 20%, while 400 people chose the B model, and the initial Pup_B was 10%. 5.4 Benchmark model results In the benchmark operation mode, users do not participate in the DR, grid companies do not need to pay subsidies, and the revenue of the wind farm only comes from the heating load at night. The revenue of a single electric heating user, the power grid, and the wind farm is calculated as shown in Table 6 . Table 6 suggests that to ensure the safe operation of the power grid, the power grid company needs to spend a significant amount of money on capacity expansion. Subsequent research will analyze the advantages of the optimization method proposed in this paper by comparing it with the benchmark model. 5.5 Optimization results of deep reinforcement learning Through dynamic DR subsidy prices, the goal of guiding users to respond on demand can be better achieved. It is more likely to improve the safety of the actual project under conditions of a large increase in the electric heating load. And an optimization framework aimed at maximizing the interests of LAs is more likely to increase the continuity of the business model. 5.5.1 Optimal dynamic subsidy prices As a paid service provider, whether the LA can make a profit is key to the sustainability of the regenerative electric heating business model. Therefore, the reward of DRL was set as the revenue of the aggregator. The number of iterations of the DQN was set to 10,000, and the calculation result is shown in Fig. 13 . After 1600 iterations, the maximum value obtained by the DQN remained unchanged. The maximum revenue of the LA was CNY 921890.8, 6.5% higher than the initial revenue. The dynamic subsidy price corresponding to the maximum profit is shown in Fig. 14 . The subsidy price in Fig. 14 first increases and then decreases because fewer users participate in the DR at the beginning of the heating season, and LAs need to inform the users about the subsidies they can receive for participating in the DR. Therefore, a higher subsidy price is set at the beginning. When a certain number of users participate in the DR, the subsidy price can be appropriately reduced to obtain higher returns. The evolution of user participation in the DR under the influence of dynamic prices is shown in Fig. 15 . Over time, the proportion of both types of users participating in the DR increases because the subsidy prices exceed the lowest expected price for the user to participate in the DR. Therefore, the users who participated in the DR at the beginning actively reduce their load to obtain the subsidy. The nonparticipating users see the benefits of the response users and gradually choose to join the DR. The comparison of the evolutionary trends of the two types of users demonstrates that the proportion of user A eventually approaches 1, while that of user B is relatively low because 0.2 CNY/kWh has exceeded the highest expected price of user A. Therefore, user A will completely adjust their heat load and thus have relatively high returns, which will have a greater impact on nonparticipating users. The overall evolution process of user A/B presents a rapid growth trend followed by a flattening trend, which conforms to the objective and actual development law. 5.5.2 Benefit analysis for all parties (1) Heating load analysis Users participating in the DR actively reduce their load during the load reduction period (7:00\u201311:00 and 18:00\u201321:00 every day). The heat retainer can also adjust the heating load in this area. To show the characteristics of the load change throughout the heating season, the changes on the first day of the first week, the 10th week, and the 19th week were analyzed (Fig. 16 ). Fig. 16 shows that in the two DR intervals, the user load decreases accordingly, and the proportion of load reduction gradually increases from the 1st week to the 19th week. According to the load data, the single-time maximum load reduction ratios without heat retainers on the first day of the first week, the 10th week, and the 19th week were 7.35%, 11.39%, and 21.45%, respectively. Therefore, the results are in line with the law that as user participation increases, the amount of load reduction also increases. After adding the heat release of the heat retainer, the load reduction ratios reached 77.99%. At night, the LA uses a heat retainer to absorb wind power. Fig. 16 shows that when the DR period ends, the user load gradually rises above the original load and then drops to the same size as the original load because when the user participates in the DR, the indoor temperature is lowered. Therefore, when the load reduction ends, more heat is required to raise the indoor temperature to the originally set temperature, i.e., there is a smaller increase above the original load. This result shows that this adjustment method can also achieve a \u201cvalley filling\u201d effect to a certain extent. (2) User heating cost analysis Users who participate in the DR receive corresponding subsidies, thereby saving heating costs compared to users who do not participate. The heating expenditure of user type A/B and nonparticipating users are shown in Fig. 17 . In the full heating season, user type A has the lowest heating cost, while user type B has slightly higher cost because user A is more price-sensitive and has a higher response to the load; thus, they receive more subsidies. Based on the overall trend, the heating expenditure of users increases first and then decreases because outdoor temperature in the heating season first decreases and then increases, and the heat load is positively correlated with the outdoor temperature. The comparison of the heating costs of user type A/B shows that the value is the same at the initial stage, but the heating cost of user type B is higher in the later stage because the subsidy in the later period is reduced; thus, the response ratio of user type B decreases. Throughout the heating season, user type A saved CNY 584.5, accounting for 8.7% of the annual heating cost; user type B saved CNY 467.3, accounting for 6.8% of the annual heating cost. (3) Wind power consumption analysis Regenerative electric heating can increase wind power consumption through heat storage compared to the benchmark model. Wind power consumption throughout the heating season is shown in Fig. 18 . The fluctuations in wind power consumption are similar to the trend of outdoor temperature in winter because wind power consumption is positively correlated with heating load. The maximum new wind power consumption in a single week is 28.7%, and the new wind power consumption across the full heating season is 17.6%. (4) LA revenue analysis Based on the model of the LA, the weekly net revenue and the breakdown of revenue and expenditure (heating revenue, heat storage expenditure, peak cut revenue, and subsidy expenditure) were calculated. The calculation results are shown in Fig. 19 . Fig. 19 indicates that the weekly net revenue of the LA shows a rapid increase in the eighth week because of the decrease in the user subsidy price and the subsidy expenditure (orange column). Starting from the 13th week, the growth rate of the LA revenue began to decline because the heating load declined at the end of the heating season along with the heating revenue. According to Fig. 14, the evolution of user participation in DR also slowed down. Therefore, the growth rate of peak cut revenue began to decline, which ultimately affected the revenue of the LA. The total revenue of the LA for the entire heating season was CNY 921839.2. 5.6 Comparison of the optimization and benchmark results The proposed regenerative electric heating operation mode and control framework can effectively increase wind power consumption and reduce peak load and user heating costs. They can also bring considerable benefits to the LA. The involved parties are concerned about the following indicators: (1) Electric heating users: saving ratio of heating cost. Calculating the user heating costs under the benchmark and DR models in the heating cycle, according to Eq. (3). (2) Power grid company: saving ratio of the cost of increasing the capacity of the grid. Calculating the cost of increasing the capacity of the grid under the benchmark and DR models, according to Eq. (5). (3) Wind farm: increasing ratio of the revenue. Calculating the revenue of the wind farm under the benchmark and DR models, according to Eq. (2). According to the values of each participant in the benchmark and DR models, the saving or increasing ratios can be further calculated. The comparison of the benefits for all parties between the benchmark model and the DR model in this study is shown in Table 7 . According to the results in Table 7, the regenerative electric heating mode adopted in this study can effectively reduce the pressure of electric heating on the power grid. The electricity distribution company can save a significant amount of expansion costs. At the same time, a large amount of wind power can be absorbed, effectively reducing the amount of wind curtailment. The reason for the relatively small saving ratio of the user heating cost is that, to ensure user thermal comfort, heating load cannot be excessively reduced. 5.7 Analysis of the applicability of the framework Based on the above results, the framework proposed in this paper can effectively fill the gaps in related research and has application value. (1) User response characteristics can be reasonably quantified via the Weber\u2013Fechner law. The quantitative performance of this law on human psychological changes under external stimuli has been verified by multiple related disciplines. The Weber\u2013Fechner law, combined with evolutionary game models, can accumulate pre-training data for actual operations. An intelligent instrument (shown in Fig. 20 ) that can realize the control of heating load based on user response characteristics was implemented in the four demonstration projects mentioned in Section 5.1. (2) At present, the increase of electric heating load is a problem facing the safe operation of power systems worldwide. As countries around the world increasingly recognize the advantages of electric heating for clean energy and renewable energy consumption, electric heating load may further increase [53]. Guiding users toward the orderly use of electricity through dynamic subsidy prices is an effective way to improve grid security. According to the results of this study, users will choose to participate in DR programs because they can save 8.7% of their heating costs, the grid will choose to issue subsidies because it can reduce the cost of grid expansion by 56.6%, and wind power farms will choose to sell low-priced electricity because it can increase wind power consumption by 17.6%. Therefore, the framework proposed in this paper, which can intelligently generate dynamic subsidy prices based on the response characteristics of different types of users, can help countries with electric heating needs to achieve their goals. 6 Conclusion This study reports the demand response process of regenerative electric heating users in rural areas with the participation of load aggregators. Using Weber\u2013Fechner law and a clustering algorithm, a demand response model that can achieve consistency between the simulation phase and operation phase was constructed. The quantitative model of user demand response behavior proposed in this study can be applied in practice by being built into smart monitors. In addition, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm was used to realize the dynamic selection of the optimal subsidy price which can maximize load aggregator profits while promoting demand response. Finally, the simulation analysis was conducted using the evolutionary game model. The achievements and conclusions of this study can be summarized as follows: (1) Using Weber\u2013Fechner law, the response characteristics of 1,000 users were simulated, and the construction of typical response characteristics was completed using the k-means algorithm. The overall evolution process of two types of users (price-sensitive and price-insensitive) presents a rapid growth trend followed by a flattening trend, which conforms to the objective and actual development law. (2) A deep Q network was used to realize dynamic user subsidy price generation. After optimization, the revenue of the load aggregator, which is the core of the regenerative electric heating operation, increased by 6.5% compared to the initial state. (3) Compared with the benchmark model, users can save up to 8.7% of their heating costs, power grid companies can save 56.6% of their investment, and wind power consumption can be increased by 17.6%. This study has the limitation of not considering the distribution of benefits among multiple parties. Regenerative electric heating contributes to the safe operation of the power grid and saves the power grid companies the cost of capacity expansion. Subsequent research should consider the reasonable allocation of the money saved through a multi-party win\u2013win mechanism to further enhance user participation.

Appendix A The thermal balance model assumes that the indoor air is fully mixed and the temperature is uniform; the inner and outer surfaces of the building have a uniform surface temperature; all heat transfer processes are one-dimensional processes. The solution to each balance can be expressed as follows: (1) Wall surface heat balance model. a. External surface heat balance The heat balance of the j-th outer surface at time t is (A1) q cond,out , j , t = q solar,out , j , t + q conv,out , j , t , (A2) q solar,out , j , t = α G , (A3) q cond,out , j , t = h conv,o T o, θ - T os, j , t , (A4) q cond,out , j , t = q cond,in , j , t = U s - s T os,j , t - T is,j , t , where q c o n d , o u t , j , t is the conduction heat, W/m2; q c o n d , o u t , j , t is the absorbed solar heat, W/m2; q c o n v , o u t , j , t is the convective heat, W/m2; α is the solar radiation absorption rate; G is the total solar radiation incident on the surface, W/m2; h c o n v , o is the convection heat transfer coefficient of the outer surface, W/(m2·K); T o s , j , t , T i s , j , t is current time outer/inter surface temperature, °C; U S - S is the external wall thermal conductivity, W/(m2·K); and T o , t is the current outdoor environment temperature, °C. According to Eqs. (A1)\u2013(A4), the outer surface temperature of the wall can be calculated as follows: (A5) T os, j , t = α G + U s - s T is, j , t + h conv,o T o U s - s + h conv,o , b. Internal surface heat balance Referring to the calculation method for the outer surface temperature to obtain the method to calculate the inner surface temperature can be expresses as follows: (A6) T is, j , θ = U s - s T os, j , θ + h conv,i T i U s - s + h conv , i , where h c o n v , i is the convection heat transfer coefficient of the inner surface, W/(m2·K). c. Window heat balance Because the thermal inertia of the window is very small, the heat transfer process of the window is treated as a steady-state process; the thermal resistance of the window mainly comes from convective thermal resistance, ignoring the heat conduction thermal resistance of the glass itself. The surface temperature can be expressed as follows: (A7) T g,is, j , t = T g,os , j , t = h conv,o T o + h conv,g T i h conv,o + h conv,g , where h c o n v , g is the convection heat transfer coefficient of the window, W/(m2·K). (2) Convective heat transfer on the inner surface Accumulate convective heat transfer of each heat transfer surface: (A8) ∑ j = 1 N A j q conv,in , j , t = ∑ j = 1 N A j h conv,i , j T is , j , θ - T i , where A j is the area of plane j, m2. (3) Infiltration heat calculations The heat of infiltration can be calculated using the following equation: (A9) q i nfiltration , t = m i nfiltration , t c p T o - T i , (A10) m i nfiltration , t = ρ air V air A leak , where m i n f i l t r a t , t is the infiltration dry air mass flow rate, kg/s; c p is infiltration air specific heat, J/(kg·K); ρ a i r is the infiltration air density, kg/m3; V a i r is the infiltration air volume flow per unit area, m3/(m2·s); A l e a k is the area of the door or window, m2. (4) Indoor air heat balance model The heat balance equation of indoor air is as follows: (A11) ∑ j = 1 N A j q conv,in , j , t + q i nfiltration + L = 0 , According to Eq. (A11), the heating load L of the building at this time is to maintain a certain set room temperature. References [1] B. Tarroja F. Chiang A. AghaKouchak S. Samuelsen S.V. Raghavan M.

        "dc:description": "Applications of electric heating, which can improve carbon emission reduction and renewable energy utilization, have brought new challenges to the safe operation of energy systems around the world. Regenerative electric heating with load aggregators and demand response is an effective means to mitigate the wind curtailment and grid operational risks caused by electric heating. However, there is still a lack of models related to demand response, which results in participants not being able to obtain maximum benefits through dynamic subsidy prices. This study uses the Weber\u2013Fechner law and a clustering algorithm to construct quantitative response characteristics models. The deep Q network was used to build a dynamic subsidy price generation framework for load aggregators. Through simulation analysis based on the evolutionary game model of a project in a rural area in Tianjin, China, the following conclusions were drawn: compared with the benchmark model, regenerative electric heating users can save up to 8.7% of costs, power grid companies can save 56.6% of their investment, and wind power plants can increase wind power consumption by 17.6%. The framework proposed in this study considers user behavior quantification of demand response participants and the differences among users. Therefore, the framework can provide a more reasonable, applicable, and intelligent system for regenerative electric heating.",
