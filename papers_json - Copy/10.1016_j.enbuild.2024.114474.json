This study proposes a comprehensive framework for Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) in Air Handling Units (AHU), emphasizing the impact of symptoms associated with various faults. The aim is to address an important limitation in FDD model development where detection is based simply on fault intensity without considering symptom impact or subjective severity criteria across faults. Instead, a new approach is introduced that factors in fault impact, utilizing impact analysis to enhance FDD accuracy and efficiency. The methodology involves three interconnected components: First, a fault impact analysis categorizes 18 fault types into stages per intensity and assesses resulting symptom impacts. Second, symptom-based intensity thresholds are established to categorize fault severity into three levels based on symptom severity. Finally, the goal is to integrate these findings into the FDD process for optimized fault detection and diagnosis. The study successfully categorized 18 faults into three severity levels, with thresholds identified for each. Furthermore, Tree-based models demonstrated effective performance when conducting FDD based on these levels. The approach provides a clear framework through three linked processes. This research combines comprehensive impact analysis with sophisticated classification methods, presenting a more defined, systematic, and efficient FDD approach. This novel methodology substantially advances fault detection and diagnosis, especially for building energy systems.

Buildings account for 35 % of global energy usage annually [1], with the projected growth rate of building energy consumption in OECD and non-OECD countries estimated at 1.5 % and 2.1 % per year, respectively [2,3]. In this context, HVAC systems constitute nearly 40 % of the total energy used in buildings [4\u20136]. Furthermore, these systems are crucial for maintaining thermal comfort [7\u20139]. Factors such as indoor temperature, relative humidity, airspeed, and radiant temperature can directly impact the thermal comfort of a building [9]. Considering the direct correlation between these influential factors and HVAC systems, incorporating them into control mechanisms is essential to ensure appropriate regulation [10]. Faults can significantly impact HVAC systems, leading to symptoms that affect energy consumption and thermal comfort [11]. Research indicates that malfunctions in the Air Handling Unit (AHU) can increase overall energy consumption and peak power demand, exerting additional strain on a building\u2019s energy system [12\u201314]. Moreover, when the system does not operate correctly, it fails to meet the setpoints established by operators, negatively affecting occupant thermal comfort [15]. Given the significant impact of these symptoms on building operations, precise and timely diagnosis of faults based on observed symptoms is crucial for efficient building management and maintaining optimal performance [16]. Therefore, the importance of Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) research is increasingly recognized for ensuring efficient building management and optimal HVAC performance. Research in FDD within the building sector has increasingly gravitated towards building performance simulation, a trend driven largely by its manifold advantages. This method's strengths are threefold. First, it adeptly replicates complex scenarios that are difficult to assess otherwise by accurately modeling physical phenomena, which is essential for predicting building performance [17]. Second, its versatility covers a range of scales, suitable for everything from small buildings to large national projects, and is adaptable to diverse architectural needs [18]. Finally, it's cost and time-efficient, outperforming physical experiments regarding resource savings and allowing for quick evaluation of multiple scenarios [11]. These attributes make building performance simulation a vital tool in enhancing building efficiency and performance in FDD research. Building performance simulation-based fault researches primarily focus on fault impact analysis and developing FDD algorithms. Building performance simulation in fault studies can be distinctly categorized into these two types. The first is fault impact analysis, which emphasizes analyzing the effects of faults on building performance. This includes examining how various faults might alter the functionality and efficiency of building systems. The second category is developing FDD algorithms from simulated faults, where research involves creating and implementing algorithms that diagnose faults using data generated through simulation. In this context, a comprehensive literature review has been conducted to further explore the recent trends of these two types. Numerous studies have been undertaken in the realm of fault impact analysis. Li et al. [19] utilized EnergyPlus simulations to assess and rank the impacts of various HVAC faults on energy consumption and occupant thermal comfort. \u201cOn\u201d state error of the HVAC system was identified as the fault with the most significant effect on site energy, source energy, and HVAC energy. Ginestet et al. [20] evaluated the influence of AHU faults on building energy consumption and indoor air quality (IAQ) through both modeling and experimental approaches. Three-way valve control issues, flow problems in mixing box dampers, and sensor inversions have a significant impact on energy consumption and IAQ, with combined faults exerting a greater effect than individual ones. Wang et al. [21] investigated the impact of various single and combined faults in a VAV (Variable Air Volume) system on the energy consumption of a large office building in Chicago using EnergyPlus, finding that combined faults could lead to an increase of more than 85 % in HVAC source energy. Basarkar, M. [22] assessed the effects of four types of faults on HVAC energy consumption through EnergyPlus, indicating increases of up to 22 %. Zhang et al. [23] analyzed the impacts of thermostat and humidistat faults on energy consumption and indoor thermal comfort in office buildings across five U.S. climate zones using EnergyPlus. Two combined faults showed that energy consumption could increase by up to 44 %, with unmet hours rising by more than 500 h. Li et al. [24] evaluated the impact of OA damper stuck, heating coil fouling, and rooftop units fan stuck faults on a medium office building using EnergyPlus, noting that energy consumption could increase by more than 100 % depending on the severity. Lu et al. [25] conducted a fault impact analysis and robustness assessment of high-performance control sequences for various HVAC system faults defined by ASHRAE 36. The impact of faults is closely related to seasonal operation conditions, with more than 90 % of fault scenarios causing less than a 6 % impact on energy consumption. Current research on fault impact predominantly focuses on detailed investigations of how building performance changes when faults occur. Reviewed studies have deeply analyzed the effects of various faults in aspects including energy consumption, thermal comfort, and indoor air quality. These investigations range from individual HVAC components, such as air handling units and variable air volume systems, to complex scenarios involving multiple interacting faults. Despite the breadth of these studies, there remains a gap in using their findings to establish fault standards or in applying them for practical fault detection. While fault impact analysis research provides valuable insights into the effects of defects, there is a need for additional efforts to translate these insights into practical standards or guidelines for building fault management. In the context of developing FDD algorithms, Lee et al. [26] developed a deep-learning-based fault detection and diagnosis model for AHUs in building HVAC systems, demonstrating an impressive diagnostic accuracy of 95.16 %. Du et al. [27] introduced a fault detection and diagnosis strategy for HVAC systems in buildings, utilizing a combination of neural networks and subtractive clustering analysis. This approach demonstrated the effectiveness of neural networks and clustering techniques in accurate and efficient fault diagnosis. Liang et al. [28] proposed a novel approach that combined the support vector machine method with a simulation-based FDD method. The results of the diagnosis showed a high accuracy rate, approaching approximately 100 %. Turner et al. [29] proposed a new data-driven approach for FDD in HVAC's cooling, heating, and ventilation, utilizing a combination of Recursive Identification Technique and ARMAX model. This approach effectively detected faults and demonstrated suitability for application in real buildings. Montazeri et al. [30] proposed FDD for AHUs using support vector machine and radial basis function neural network. The main contribution of this study is the identification of optimal variables essential for effective AHUs FDD and the simultaneous detection of sensor and actuator faults. The proposed method demonstrates that FDD can achieve higher performance compared to previous research studies. The feasibility of implementing high-performance FDD models using various machine learning algorithms, including deep neural networks and support vector machines, has been confirmed through a literature review. However, despite these advancements, we identified a significant limitation in previous research: the absence of clear and standardized criteria for defining faults or their severity. In essence, researchers had to arbitrarily set thresholds for fault definition, such as determining the temperature deviation triggering a fault diagnosis. This method often relies on subjective judgment or reference ranges used in other studies. This approach has led to two main problems. Firstly, it resulted in inconsistent standards across different studies, even when dealing with the same type of fault. For example, one study [26] defined a fault in the SAT sensor at a 2 °C bias, while another [27] set the threshold at 1.5 °C. The second issue arises when diagnosing multiple faults. Each fault is assessed according to arbitrarily set separate criteria, disregarding the impact of the respective fault. This method overlooks the diverse impacts of different faults. For instance, a 2 °C bias in the SAT sensor and a 2 °C bias in the RAT (Return Air Temperature) sensor could significantly differ in their impact on energy consumption. Therefore, treating these as faults of the same level could potentially reduce the efficiency of the FDD process. Ultimately, defining a fault or its severity should not solely rely on arbitrarily set thresholds for the fault\u2019s intensity but rather consider the impact each fault generates. This underscores the need for active utilization of impact analysis in determining fault criteria. This research is dedicated to developing an enhanced FDD framework anchored in an impact-driven symptom analysis approach. The framework is designed to establish uniform, rationale-based criteria applicable to a wide array of fault types, thereby enhancing FDD performance. The objectives are structured across three distinct but interconnected steps: 1. Fault impact analysis: The initial objective is to thoroughly assess the impacts of different faults in AHU systems by categorizing each fault into 100 intensity stages. 2. Symptom-based intensity threshold establishment: This step involves categorizing faults into three severity levels based on their symptoms, aiming to accurately define thresholds for each level to enhance fault detection and diagnosis system\u2019s accuracy and efficiency. 3. Implementation of established severity level criteria in FDD modeling: The final objective focuses on implementing pre-established criteria for fault severity levels and types in FDD modeling, aiming for comprehensive classification of AHU faults and their severity while identifying the most effective models for reliable fault detection and diagnosis. 2 Methodology 2.1 Research procedure Fig. 1 shows the overall process of the study. The modeling of the target building and fault modeling was conducted using EnergyPlus version 23.2. The medium office reference building [31] was selected as the target building, with the simulation period set for a full year, from January 1st to December 31st, at hourly intervals [32]. In the case of target faults, 18 faults that can occur in AHUs were identified as target faults based on the ASHRAE report and related studies [33\u201336]. Each fault was divided into 100 intensity stages, progressively intensifying these faults in the simulations, leading to a total of 18,000 simulations. Based on these simulation results, an impact analysis of AHU faults on six symptoms was conducted: electric energy consumption, gas energy consumption, peak load of electricity, peak load of gas, setpoint unmet hours while occupied, and average Predicted Percentage Dissatisfied (PPD). The next stage involved establishing symptom-based severity thresholds. This involved first defining severity levels based on the magnitude of the symptoms into three stages: level 1, level 2, and level 3. This definition allowed for criteria that reflect the magnitude of symptoms across all types of faults. Next, to clearly identify the points at which each severity level is reached, thresholds were determined using the results from the previously conducted impact analysis. These thresholds were tabulated, setting fault intensity standards for each fault type corresponding to the severity levels. The final stage of the research involved applying established criteria for classifying types of faults and their severity levels, leading to the construction of an FDD model. This phase incorporated the use of four distinct machine learning algorithms: Random Forest (RF) [37], Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) [38], Decision Tree (DT) [39], and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classification model [40]. An evaluation was conducted to ascertain the most suitable model based on their performance. Furthermore, an assessment was done to identify features that significantly influenced classification performance. 2.2 Description of simulation model For this study, a three-story, medium-office DOE commercial reference building was used [41]. It has a rectangular shape with a total floor area of 4982 m2 and a floor height of 3.9 m, including the return plenum. The window area ratio of the target building was set to 33 %. The floor zones are divided into four perimeter zones, which are highly affected by the thermal environment and solar radiation from the outside, and one interior zone, which represents a relatively constant indoor load [42]. In this study, the comparative analysis was based on the interior zone, which has the largest floor area of 983 m2 per floor and has less external influence. The physical properties and window thermal performance of the target building are in accordance with ASHRAE standard 90.1 [43]. In addition, the internal heat gain conditions are shown in Table 1 . The occupancy, lighting, equipment, and HVAC schedules comply with ASHRAE Standard 90.1 [44]. The building's HVAC system consists of AHUs, including economizers, cooling coils, heating coils, and supply fans on each floor, and VAV units in each zone. The cooling coils are DX coils and use electricity; the heating coils use natural gas, and there is no central plant. In addition, the VAV units in each zone have built-in reheat coils that use electricity. The indoor cooling set-point is set at 24℃, and the heating set-point is set at 21℃. Other system inputs are shown in Table 2 . The simulations were based on Chicago and used weather data from the international weather for energy calculation provided by EnergyPlus. Chicago weather data is often used as a benchmark in building simulation for several compelling reasons. Chicago's climate is characterized by a wide range of temperatures and conditions, including hot summers, cold winters, and variable humidity levels. This diversity makes it an excellent condition for evaluating a building's performance across different environmental scenarios [45]. 2.3 Fault modeling Table 3 provides detailed information on different AHU fault models, specifying the types of equipment affected, the techniques employed to simulate these faults [33\u201336] in EnergyPlus, and the range of fault intensities considered in the simulations. Fig. 2 shows a schematic of the HVAC system with the fault points identified. The analysis thoroughly investigates different faults in building systems, mainly concentrating on areas like the building envelope, HVAC scheduling, duct systems, sensors, outdoor air dampers, fans, and filters. The model begins with an examination of excessive infiltration in the building envelope (Fault 1), characterized by unwanted air leakages that can lead to significant energy loss and reduced efficiency in heating and cooling systems. Addressing this issue is essential for optimal energy use and effective HVAC performance. In terms of HVAC scheduling, the model simulates various operational anomalies, including early onset (Fault 2, the HVAC system activating earlier than scheduled), late-onset (Fault 3, delayed activation), early termination (Fault 4, the system shutting down prematurely), and late termination (Fault 5, the system operating longer than intended). Each scenario could result in energy inefficiencies and impact indoor thermal environmental quality. The model also investigates duct system leakages (Fault 6), which can cause loss of conditioned air and affect air distribution efficiency within the building. Sensor faults, including offsets in the IAT (Indoor Air Temperature / Fault 7, Fault 8), SAT (Fault 9, Fault 10), OAT (Outdoor Air Temperature / Fault 11, Fault 12), and RAT sensors (Fault 13, Fault 14), are extensively modeled. These faults can lead to improper HVAC operations, as the system may inaccurately respond to false temperature readings. Outdoor air damper faults are also considered, particularly cases where the dampers get stuck (Fault 15), either restricting or allowing excess outdoor air into the system, thus impacting energy efficiency and indoor air quality. Fan-related issues, such as fan motor efficiency degradation (Fault 16) and supply fan getting stuck (Fault 17), are also modeled. These issues can decrease fan total efficiency, leading to higher energy consumption or poor air circulation. Finally, the model includes scenarios of filters becoming dirty (Fault 18), a condition that can cause a pressure rise in the system, reducing efficiency and potentially damaging components. In setting the intensity of faults, this study aims to apply the broadest possible range that can be feasibly implemented in the EnergyPlus model. For detailed analysis, this range was divided into 100 stages, allowing for a precise determination of the threshold effects. The primary focus of this investigation was the mid-floor interior zone of an office building. For the parametric investigation, this range was divided into 100 stages to delicately find the threshold. 2.4 Fault symptom and severity level In this research, the categorization of fault symptoms was approached from two primary perspectives: energy and thermal comfort. This approach was intended to conduct impact analysis and establish threshold criteria. For the energy aspect, indices such as total electricity consumption, peak electricity consumption, total gas consumption, and peak gas consumption were selected. Regarding thermal comfort, indices like setpoint unmet hour and average PPD were chosen. The severity of faults was categorized into three severity levels, each prioritized according to the specific symptom\u2019s reference. The criteria for level 3 severity were initially determined as a point of complete failure, serving as a foundational basis for establishing standards for severity levels. For energy-related standards, a 30 % threshold was established, reflecting the fault\u2019s impact on energy as identified in a fault detection review study [12,22,44,46]. For unmet hours, the benchmark was set at 300 h, in line with ASHRAE 90.1 recommendations for normal buildings [43]. Regarding the PPD, a standard of 20 % was adopted, aligning with ASHRAE 55\u2032s guidelines for normal buildings [47]. This structuring of level 3 was then used as a basis for detailed fault detection, with the severity scale divided evenly into thirds to define levels 1 and 2. 2.5 FDD model In this study, four classification models were employed: RF, XGBoost, DT, and ANN, for fault detection and diagnosis based on the severity level of faults. Three tree-based models (RF, XGBoost, DT) with high classification performance according to fault severity were selected from various models in previous studies, and ANN was adopted. In this study, the implementation and analysis of the tree-based model was done using the Scikit-learn library, and the ANN model was done using the Tensorflow library in Python 3.11. DT is a machine learning technique that forms the basis of tree-based ensemble learning methods. It hierarchically divides the data space and constructs a decision tree that fits the relationships among data. Due to the decision tree structure formed through learning, DT possesses strong interpretability and high computational efficiency, making it an essential foundation for ensemble learning algorithms [39]. Compared to other tree-based models, DT is widely used across various fields due to its simplicity and ease of interpretation [39]. In recent years, tree-based ensemble learning methods that consider the prediction results of multiple decision trees have been developed, and representative methods include Bagging and Boosting. Bagging, short for Bootstrap Aggregating, enhances the diversity of base learners by modifying how each learner is trained. This method involves training multiple learners in parallel and then combining their predictions by averaging the results or using a majority voting system. However, Boosting is a method that focuses on sequentially training multiple learners, each learning from the information of its predecessors. This process involves giving more weight to learners that follow, continuously refining the training data for subsequent learners [39]. In this study, RF, a Bagging integration strategy, and XGBoost, a Boosting integration strategy, were employed. Additionally, ANN was used, which is a method mimicking biological neural networks. ANNs are supervised multi-classifiers and consist of several hidden layers, one input layer, and one output layer. In each layer, artificial neurons, or nodes, are interconnected with nodes in neighboring layers. During model training, the weights assigned to these connections are fine-tuned to minimize the discrepancy between the desired target and the actual output. ANNs are often used in FDD and have been shown to exhibit high performance [48\u201350]. The performance of the four classification models was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 Score [51]. Accuracy refers to the percentage of data that the model correctly classified out of the total data. Precision represents the percentage of data that the model predicts to be in a positive class that is actually positive. Precision measures the accuracy of the model's positive predictions, with high precision resulting in a lower FP rate. Recall refers to the percentage of data that the model predicts to be positive out of the data that is actually positive. 2.6 Construction of learning dataset for machine learning In this study, the training data for classifying various faults in AHUs according to severity levels was scoped to include hourly data over one year for 100 stages of each of the 18 faults. The labeling was done based on the intensity thresholds of each fault according to the previously set severity levels. The focus was placed on data detectable by real-world sensors when configuring the training data. This approach was chosen because data measured in actual buildings will be used for classification in future research; therefore, data that can be captured by sensors in real-world buildings was utilized as the training data. The analysis target zone was primarily set to be the interior zone, where the measurable input data were focused. The indoor air temperature of the interior zone across three floors, along with the temperature and airflow rate of the air being supplied to and returned from the interior zone, were mainly established as key input data. Electricity and natural gas consumption were categorized into two scenarios: cooling and heating. Additionally, the zone setpoint was not met, while occupied time was similarly divided and utilized as input data. Therefore, the training data consists of 24-hour records based on the HVAC operation schedule over one year, with a training-to-testing ratio set at 7:3. The total number of data points is 8,538,812. Before using the input variables as training data, Variance Inflation Factors (VIF) [52,53] were calculated among all input variables. VIF serves as a means to measure and quantify how much the variance of a variable is inflated, commonly calculated as part of regression analysis [52]. Equation (1) shows the equation for VIF, where R i 2 is the correlation between the i th variable and the rest of the variables. VIF is used to indicate the degree of correlation among input variables, where a VIF of 9 signifies that even if the specific input variable is removed, the remaining variables can still explain over 90 % of the variance [53]. Furthermore, if the VIF exceeds 10, it is considered indicative of multicollinearity, and the presence of multicollinearity can lead to distortions in classification or regression. Therefore, through the calculation of VIF among input variables, those with VIF values exceeding ten were eliminated, resulting in the final selection of input variables. Table 4 presents the ultimately chosen input variables. The selected target zone in the interior is referred to as CORE, and the terms BOTTOM, MID, and TOP represent the number of floors. OAH stands for outdoor air humidity. SAFR and RAFR indicate supply airflow rate and return airflow rate. ZNMT represents the zone setpoint not met while occupied time, which is divided into two scenarios: heating and cooling. ECO refers to the Economizer, and the number following it denotes the floor on which the respective economizer is located. (1) VIF = 1 1 - R i 2 = 1 Tolerance where. R i 2 = correlation between the i th variable and the rest of the variables. 3 Result 3.1 Impact analysis To understand the impacts caused by various faults in depth, an impact analysis was conducted for six symptoms. In setting the intensity range for faults, for those with a clearly defined upper limit that could lead to the most severe fault, the intensity range was established from the reference intensity value to the maximum intensity variable value. For faults with an undefined upper limit, such as excessive infiltration and pressure rise due to a dirty filter, the intensity range was set from the reference intensity value to a range that is ten times the difference from the reference intensity value. Subsequently, parametric simulations were performed for each type of fault, with 100 steps within the set intensity range starting from the base case. The values for six symptoms regarding the base case have been summarized in Table 5 . For the analysis of results, the five fault types that induced the most severe impacts were selected based on their maximum values. The magnitude of symptoms as these faults progressed was plotted on a chart. The outcomes are presented as follows. Based on the analyzed data, the impact of different types of faults on the total and peak electric consumption of a building can be summarized as follows. In the analysis of total electricity consumption (Fig. 3 ), a dirty filter (Fault 18) resulted in the most significant impact, with a 66.6 % increase. This is due to the obstruction of airflow caused by filter contamination, leading the HVAC system to consume more electricity. Excessive infiltration of the envelope (Fault 1) caused the second-largest impact, with a 49.0 % increase. This is a result of the HVAC system using more electricity due to the excessive infiltration of external air. IAT negative offset (Fault 8), HVAC schedule early onset (Fault 2), and SAT positive onset (Fault 9) each contributed to increases of 17.4 %, 13.3 %, and 13.0 %, respectively. These faults led to inefficient operation of the HVAC system, thereby increasing electric consumption. Similarly, for peak electricity consumption (Fig. 4 ), the dirty filter (Fault 18) had the largest impact, with an increase of 111.5 %. Excessive infiltration of the envelope (Fault 1) caused the second-largest impact, with a 62.7 % increase. This resulted in an overload of the HVAC system during peak times. Outdoor air damper stuck (Fault 15), supply air duct leakage (Fault 6), and SAT positive onset (Fault 9) each contributed to increases of 15.8 %, 4.4 %, and 3.5 %, respectively. This observation indicates that various faults in AHUs can significantly affect both the total and peak power consumption. The following findings were observed after analyzing the impact of different types of faults on the total gas consumption of buildings (Fig. 5 ). A positive offset in the SAT sensor (Fault 9) resulted in the most significant increase in total gas consumption by 533.1 %. This is due to the HVAC system inefficiently increasing heating. Outdoor air damper stuck (Fault 15) led to a 374.2 % increase in total gas consumption. This occurs as the angle at which the damper is stuck increases, leading to a greater influx of fresh air, which in turn increases the load on the heating system. OAT sensor positive offset (Fault 11) and the supply fan getting stuck (Fault 17) led to increases in total gas consumption by 82.4 % and 76.8 %, respectively. These issues, caused by incorrect temperature sensor readings and supply fan malfunctions, result in the system using more gas. Excessive infiltration of the envelope (Fault 1) increased total gas consumption by 74.3 %, indicating that the infiltration of outside air forces the heating system to use more energy. In the analysis of the impact on peak gas consumption (Fig. 6 ), it was found that the outdoor air damper stuck (Fault 15) increased peak consumption by 13.2 %, significantly affecting gas usage during peak times. Supply fan getting stuck (Fault 17) and SAT Sensor positive offset (Fault 9) increased peak consumption by 10.7 % and 9.2 % respectively. This is due to the hindrance in air circulation within the HVAC system and the detection of higher temperatures, leading to inefficient operation. Excessive infiltration of the envelope (Fault 1) and IAT sensor positive offset (Fault 7) caused peak consumption to increase by 3.3 % and 1.3 %, respectively, indicating that these faults particularly impact gas usage during peak periods. The supply fan getting stuck (Fault 17) exhibited an exceptional pattern. Initially, the decrease in flow rate due to the reduced performance of the supply fan led to an increase in gas consumption as the boiler operated more vigorously. However, once the flow rate reduction surpasses a certain level (observed at the 76th measurement point), the efficiency of heat transfer significantly diminishes. This is due to inadequate air circulation, resulting in a marked decrease or near cessation of boiler operation. Consequently, gas consumption drops sharply. The analysis of symptoms related to thermal comfort revealed distinct setpoint unmet hours for various fault types (Fig. 7 ). The IAT sensor positive offset (Fault 7) had the most significant impact, failing to meet the setpoint for 4593 h. This issue arises from the temperature sensor's error, leading to extended periods where the indoor temperature deviates from the set range. The supply fan getting stuck (Fault 17) affected the system for 4064 h, a problem caused by the supply fan's malfunction, hindering proper air circulation and temperature control. The IAT sensor negative offset (Fault 8) and SAT sensor negative offset (Fault 10) impacted for 1740.3 and 1473.8 h, respectively, due to inaccurate readings from the temperature sensors. Finally, the supply air duct leakage (Fault 6) influenced the system for 1243.8 h, attributable to air loss and temperature control issues caused by duct leakage. In terms of the average PPD (Fig. 8 ), the supply fan getting stuck (Fault 17) recorded the highest at 69.5 %, indicating that issues with the supply system led to indoor temperatures and air quality not meeting user expectations. The IAT sensor positive offset (Fault 7) and IAT sensor negative offset (Fault 8) had impacts of 52.4 % and 40.9 %, respectively, which are attributed to the instability in the indoor environment caused by errors in the temperature sensors. The excessive infiltration of the envelope (Fault 1) and supply air duct leakage (Fault 6) showed effects at 15.9 % and 12.6 %, respectively, demonstrating the impact of external air infiltration and duct leakage on the indoor environment. 3.2 Symptom-Based intensity threshold result Table 6 shows the results of organizing the Symptom-Based Intensity Threshold into a table, including the fault type, fault intensity variable, each symptom's severity level, and the corresponding threshold values. To elaborate on the threshold values, these represent the intensity value of the fault at the moment it crosses into a specific severity level. For each fault, the lowest threshold value reaching a specific severity level was set as the fault criteria, and this was indicated in gold color. Higher severity level criteria thresholds are emphasized with a darker shade. Upon reviewing the results for faults in different equipment, it is evident that the fault concerning excessive infiltration of the envelope (Fault 1) significantly impacts total electricity consumption, total gas consumption, and peak electricity, reaching a severity of level 3. The criteria threshold is specifically set for total gas consumption. The diagnosis progresses to level 1, level 2, and level 3 severity as the flowrate per area increases by 0.00054 [m3/s*m2], 0.00078 [m3/s*m2], and 0.00105 [m3/s*m2], respectively. When examining HVAC schedule-related faults (Faults 2\u20135), it is apparent that the results vary significantly based on whether the operational hours increase or decrease. Fault 2 and Fault 5 occur when the HVAC system activates before the scheduled onset time and shuts down later than the designated termination time, extending the original operation period and leading to an increase in total electricity consumption up to level 1 severity. Specifically, Fault 2 reaches level 1 when the HVAC operates 364 min early, and Fault 5 when it operates 379.2 min early. On the other hand, Fault 3 and Fault 4, where the HVAC has a late onset and early termination, lead to periods when the HVAC does not operate within the set operation period, impacting setpoint unmet hours up to level 3 severity. For Fault 3, turning on 144, 268.8, and 364.8 min late can be diagnosed as level 1, level 2, and level 3, respectively. Fault 4, turning off 124.8, 259.2, and 336 min early, is diagnosed as level 1, level 2, and level 3, respectively. Next, examining the fault related to ducts, specifically the supply air duct leakage (Fault 6), it is observed that it affects both total electricity consumption and setpoint unmet hour. When comparing these two, the threshold value for setpoint unmet hour has been designated as the criteria threshold. Accordingly, for Fault 6, leakage fractions of 5.1 %, 8.7 %, and 11.4 % correspond to diagnoses of level 1, level 2, and level 3, respectively. In the case of faults related to sensors, starting with the IAT sensor faults (Fault 7 and Fault 8), it is evident that both faults directly impact thermal comfort, affecting two related indices up to level 3 severity. For the severity criteria, Fault 7 is determined based on Average PPD, where positive offsets of 1.2 °C, 1.8 °C, and 2.4 °C correspond to level 1, level 2, and level 3 diagnoses, respectively. For Fault 8, setpoint unmet hour is the determining factor, with negative offsets of 5.2 °C, 6.3 °C, and 7 °C leading to level 1, level 2, and level 3 diagnoses, respectively. This indicates that for IAT sensor faults, setting a tighter criterion for positive offsets is preferable. For the SAT sensor faults (Fault 9 and Fault 10), a positive offset impacted both total electricity consumption and total gas consumption, with the criteria threshold determined based on total gas consumption. Thus, for the SAT sensor, positive offsets of 0.2 °C, 0.4 °C, and 0.6 °C correspond to level 1, level 2, and level 3 diagnoses, respectively. Conversely, negative offsets significantly affected setpoint unmet hour, with negative offsets of 6.2 °C, 6.4 °C, and 6.6 °C leading to level 1, level 2, and level 3 diagnoses, respectively. This suggests that for the SAT sensor, a tighter criterion should be applied to negative offsets compared to positive offsets. Regarding the OAT sensor faults (Fault 11 and Fault 12), a positive offset influenced total gas consumption up to level 3, while a negative offset did not produce significant impacts on the symptoms of interest. Therefore, for the OAT sensor, positive offsets of 3.7 °C, 5.2 °C, and 6.3 °C were diagnosed as level 1, level 2, and level 3, respectively. Moving to the RAT sensor faults (Fault 13 and Fault 14), a positive offset affected total gas consumption up to level 1, but a negative offset, similarly, did not significantly impact the relevant symptoms. As a result, a positive offset of 8.5 °C was diagnosed as level 1 for the RAT sensor. Thus, for both OAT and RAT sensors, since negative offsets do not meaningfully affect building symptoms, it can be concluded that only positive offsets need to be considered. In the case of the fault related to the damper, specifically the outdoor air damper stuck (Fault 15), it was found to impact total gas consumption, peak electricity, and peak gas. Among these, the threshold value for total gas consumption was set as the criteria threshold. The fault can be diagnosed as level 1, level 2, and level 3 when the outdoor air minimum fraction is set to 43.05 %, 44.75 %, and 47.3 %, respectively. When examining faults related to fans (Fault 16 and Fault 17), it was observed that the fault involving fan motor efficiency degradation (Fault 16) did not produce significant symptoms. Fan motor efficiency degradation is largely related to the rise in supply air temperature caused by the fan, and consequently, the heat produced in the fan motor affects the supply air temperature through the fan. It should be noted that this analysis specifically considers motor efficiency, not the total efficiency of the fan. Furthermore, if the total efficiency of the fan were considered, it is reasonable to expect a noticeable increase in energy consumption. Therefore, the symptoms arising from fan motor efficiency degradation were insufficient to determine a criteria threshold. However, the supply fan getting stuck (Fault 17) exhibited meaningful symptoms affecting total gas consumption, peak gas, setpoint unmet hour, and average PPD. The criteria threshold was determined based on setpoint unmet hour, and the fault can be diagnosed as level 1, level 2, and level 3 when the flow rate decreased ratio is at 32 %, 36 %, and 39 %, respectively. Finally, examining the fault related to the filter, specifically the dirty filter (Fault 18), it was found to impact total electricity consumption, peak electricity consumption, and setpoint unmet hour. In the case of Fault 18, when determining the threshold criteria, both total gas consumption and peak electricity symptoms were considered. For level 1, the threshold was set at the lowest value for total gas consumption, which is 1452.79 Pa. For levels 2 and 3, the lowest values for peak electricity thresholds were set at 1574.78 Pa and 1608.05 Pa, respectively. This implies that early in the fault occurrence, total electricity consumption should be closely monitored, and as the fault intensifies, observation of peak electricity becomes necessary. 3.3 FDD modeling This research aimed to perform FDD by setting predefined severity levels for 18 faults. Table 7 shows the number of test data by label. Label 0 consists of data without faults and data not reaching severity level 1, holding the highest number of data points. Labels were determined based on the previously decided Symptom-Based Intensity Threshold, where in labels like Fault1_1, the first number indicates the type of fault, and the second number represents the severity level. The classification was carried out based on these labels using four different classification models: DT, RF, XGBoost, and ANN, and their performances were evaluated. 3.3.1 Hyperparameters of the FDD model Table 8 shows the optimized hyperparameters for each tree-based FDD model. In the DT model, the maximum depth was set to 100 to capture complex patterns while preventing overfitting. A minimum of 15 samples was required to split a node, and at least six samples were needed for a leaf node, ensuring reliability in the tree's decisions. The next step involves meticulously fine-tuning hyperparameters to balance accuracy and prevent overfitting in the RF model. A total of 300 trees (n_estimators) were used for robustness, and the max_depth was set to 40 to achieve complexity without overfitting. The minimum samples required for splits and leaves were set at 15 and 6, respectively, ensuring reliable decisions. These settings were optimized to enhance performance on our dataset, focusing on a balance between learning complex patterns and maintaining generalization. Subsequently, in the XGBoost model, a low learning rate of 0.001 was set, ensuring gradual and precise model adjustments and preventing overfitting. The maximum depth was established at 40, allowing for the learning of complex patterns without excessive complexity. Utilizing 300 estimators, the model achieved a robust learning process. A subsample rate of 0.9 was chosen, ensuring each tree in the ensemble considers a data subset, aiding in overfitting reduction and enhancing generalization. These parameters were selected to strike a balance between the model's learning capability and its generalization to new data. Next, Table 9 shows the optimized hyperparameters of the ANN FDD model. The hyperparameters of the ANN model were meticulously optimized with keras_tuner [54] to ensure good performance. The configured network consists of six layers, with unit counts ranging from 500 to 600, striking a balance between model complexity and processing capacity. To combat overfitting, dropout rates were tactically set between 0.0 and 0.2, enabling selective deactivation of neurons during training. A higher dropout rate of 0.2 in the middle layers acts as a safeguard against the complexity of the deeper network levels. Activation functions play a critical role; 'ReLU' [55] activation was applied for the intermediate layers to introduce non-linearity, while the output layer employs 'softmax' [56] activation suitable for multi-class classification. The model operates on a learning rate of 0.0001, promoting gradual and stable weight adjustments. Additionally, 'categorical_crossentropy' [57] was chosen as the loss function, which is standard for multi-class classification problems, ensuring that the model's predictions are finely tuned to the probability distribution of the classes. 3.3.2 Performance evaluation of the FDD model Table 10 shows the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores of four models. Among these, the DT model showed the highest accuracy at 88.1 %, indicating overall superior performance. However, its precision and recall were relatively lower, with an F1 Score of 63.8 %, reflecting a balance between precision and recall but also indicating potential for improvement. The RF model, with an accuracy of 85.3 %, was slightly less than DT but still performed well. Notably, its precision was impressive at 86.2 %, meaning it was mostly accurate in predicting labels. However, its recall was low at 52.6 %. The F1 score was 59.2 %, lower than the DT, suggesting a lack of balance between precision and recall. The XGBoost model also showed high accuracy at 86.4 %, with trends in precision and recall similar to RF and the same F1 Score. The ANN model had the lowest accuracy at 79.3 % and also the lowest precision and recall, indicating a need to improve model specificity and sensitivity. Its F1 score was also the lowest at 45.1 %. In conclusion, the evaluation of the four models reveals distinct strengths and weaknesses across different metrics. The DT model, with the highest accuracy, excels in general classification tasks but falls short in precision and recall. The RF model, while slightly less accurate than DT, shows remarkable precision, suggesting its effectiveness in correctly labeling positive cases. However, its lower recall and F1 score highlight a challenge in identifying all relevant cases. XGBoost aligns closely with RF in terms of performance, sharing similar precision, recall, and F1 score patterns. The ANN model, though lagging in overall accuracy, precision, and recall, underscores the complexity of the task and the potential need for further tuning and exploration of different architectures. The tree-based models demonstrated exceptional performance in multi-class classification problems, with the simpler architecture of the DT outperforming the more complex RF and XGBoost models. 3.3.3 Feature importance of tree-based model In tree-based models like XGBoost, RF, and DT classifiers, a metric known as feature importance indicates how significant each input data is to the model's predictions. Table 11 presents the top seven features with the highest importance for each model\u2014DT, RF, and XGBoost\u2014along with their respective feature importance values which are presented to three decimal places. The top three features in DT model are related to airflow rate, each showing a high importance of over 0.08. Following these are features related to the mid-floor interior zone VAV box damper position, which is also linked to airflow rate. Additionally, features like NaturalGas: HVAC, CORE_MID:SAT, and Electricity:Facility show high importance. The top seven features in the RF model, showing a similar trend to DT, particularly the top three features associated with airflow rate. Six out of the top seven features share high importance in both DT and RF models. In contrast, the XGBoost model reveals a significant influence of CORE_MID:Cooling ZNMT, differing from DT and RF. However, the subsequent features show a degree of similarity to those in DT and RF. Notably, airflow rate appears to have a substantial impact on classification in all three models. 4 Conclusion In conclusion, this research introduces a novel FDD framework for AHUs, employing an impact-driven symptom analysis approach. Rather than being seen as isolated processes, the three stages of this study are presented as interconnected elements that synergistically form a cohesive framework. The key outcomes of each stage are as follows: Impact Analysis: This stage identified crucial faults affecting electricity consumption, gas consumption, and thermal comfort. It highlighted the profound effects of specific faults like dirty filters and excessive infiltration of envelope on electricity consumption and the SAT sensor positive offset on gas consumption. The impact on thermal comfort, particularly in terms of setpoint unmet hours and PPD, was also notably influenced by faults like supply fan getting stuck. Establishing symptom-based intensity thresholds: The study established criteria thresholds for different fault types based on symptom severity levels. It provided a rational and systematic approach to categorizing faults, enhancing the precision of the FDD process. This approach ensures that faults are evaluated based on their actual impact on the system rather than arbitrary or inconsistent thresholds. FDD with established criteria: The research further demonstrated the effectiveness of DT, RF, XGBoost, and ANN in accurately detecting and diagnosing faults by symptoms. The comparison based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 Score showed that DT had the highest accuracy, confirming the suitability of tree-based models for complex FDD applications in AHUs. The feature importance analysis, which identified airflow rate as a significant factor, provides actionable insights for optimizing FDD models. Overall, this research presented a structured and effective FDD framework for AHUs, utilizing a unique combination of impact analysis, symptom-based intensity thresholds, and machine learning models. This comprehensive approach not only overcomes the limitations of previous studies by providing standardized criteria for fault severity but also enhances the accuracy and efficiency of the FDD process. The findings from this research hold significant potential for application in real-world settings, paving the way for more reliable and efficient building energy management systems. While this study outlines a reasonable workflow for fault diagnosis that can be applied to various building types beyond medium-sized office buildings, it cautions against directly applying specific results (such as severity thresholds and classification models' feature importance) to other building types. Consequently, further research is needed to apply and validate this integrated framework across different building types to explore its generalizability. Additionally, although this study focuses on framework development through simulations, it underscores the importance of validating the framework with actual building data. Recognizing the significance of practical application, the study has emphasized selecting data that can be realistically measured to demonstrate the process. Future research should apply the framework to buildings in operation to assess its effectiveness in real-world data environments, such as sensor settings. This validation process is essential to enhance the practical applicability of the framework and to verify its actual impact.

        "dc:description": "This study proposes a comprehensive framework for Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) in Air Handling Units (AHU), emphasizing the impact of symptoms associated with various faults. The aim is to address an important limitation in FDD model development where detection is based simply on fault intensity without considering symptom impact or subjective severity criteria across faults. Instead, a new approach is introduced that factors in fault impact, utilizing impact analysis to enhance FDD accuracy and efficiency. The methodology involves three interconnected components: First, a fault impact analysis categorizes 18 fault types into stages per intensity and assesses resulting symptom impacts. Second, symptom-based intensity thresholds are established to categorize fault severity into three levels based on symptom severity. Finally, the goal is to integrate these findings into the FDD process for optimized fault detection and diagnosis. The study successfully categorized 18 faults into three severity levels, with thresholds identified for each. Furthermore, Tree-based models demonstrated effective performance when conducting FDD based on these levels. The approach provides a clear framework through three linked processes. This research combines comprehensive impact analysis with sophisticated classification methods, presenting a more defined, systematic, and efficient FDD approach. This novel methodology substantially advances fault detection and diagnosis, especially for building energy systems.",
