School of Civil Engineering and Architecture Zhejiang Sci-Tech University Hangzhou 310018 China Model-based predictive control has proven effective for managing indoor temperature and humidity in variable air volume (VAV) air conditioning systems. However, delays in temperature and humidity adjustments in response to changes in internal and external environmental conditions can impede high-performance operation. This study introduces a dynamic predictive control model for the multi-zone indoor temperature and humidity of VAV systems, designed to predict and control these parameters in real-time. Utilizing the RC network two-node wall structure method and backward finite difference scheme, a multi-zone building model is developed. Coupled with a deep fuzzy cognitive map (DFCM) for temperature and humidity prediction, and controlled by a PID controller, the model dynamically regulates the opening degrees of terminal air dampers and chilled water valves. Implemented on a networked control platform in a large commercial building, the model consistently maintained indoor temperature and humidity within ±0.5 °C and ±0.1 g/(kg dry air) of the target values under varying conditions, demonstrating substantial improvements in stability and operational efficiency. The research enhances the predictability and control of HVAC systems through advanced algorithmic integration, improving real-time indoor climate management in complex building environments. This method offers a practical improvement in HVAC control technologies, which could be beneficial for applications in commercial building management systems, providing a useful tool for supporting energy efficiency and sustainability in modern infrastructures.

Consequently, enhancing the energy efficiency of air conditioning systems is crucial for reducing overall building energy consumption [5,6]. Indoor temperature and humidity are crucial parameters in the operation of variable air volume (VAV) air conditioning systems, which maintain these conditions within a set range by precisely regulating the openings of terminal air dampers, chilled water valves, and fan speeds. However, delayed responses in adjusting indoor temperature and humidity due to the lagged influence of system variables and external environmental conditions can cause issues such as instability and reduced energy efficiency in these systems. To address these delays, Bai et al. [7] proposed using an adaptive Smith predictor for lag compensation in the control system. This method has demonstrated effectiveness in mitigating the impact of time delays within the HVAC control loop, though it necessitates an accurate mathematical model of the controlled object. Consequently, developing a multi-zone building mathematical model that can accurately and timely predict indoor temperature and humidity, based on control variables and environmental parameters, is essential for improving control responsiveness and efficiency in VAV systems. To model the heat transfer of building envelopes, researchers have utilized resistance-capacitance (RC) network methods [8,9]. Xu et al. [10] employed a genetic algorithm combined with an RC network to simplify the building envelope model, achieving accurate calculations of transient heat transfer. Li et al. [11] developed a simplified RC network model for pipe-embedded concrete radiant floors, analyzing the complex heat transfer in concrete plates. Further extending this approach, Jin et al. [12] established a multi-zone building model based on energy balance theory and the RC network method, enabling simulation of dynamic responses in room temperature and humidity. However, their model did not extensively analyze the heat transfer of internal building mass. Addressing a similar scope, Lei et al. [13] analyzed heat transfer between the building interior and its envelope but did not account for energy ingress through doors and windows, nor the heat dissipation from humans, lighting, and equipment, leading to potential discrepancies between model calculations and actual values. Given these gaps, there is a clear need to develop a comprehensive multi-zone building model that considers all relevant factors influencing indoor temperature and humidity to enhance accuracy. To address control delay issues in VAV air conditioning systems and achieve real-time regulation of indoor temperature and humidity, it is essential to develop a multi-zone building model that can precisely calculate these parameters and to utilize advanced algorithms for optimizing control methods. These include regulating the opening of terminal air dampers, chilled water valves, and fan speeds. Traditional systems often employ proportional integral (PI) or proportional integral differential (PID) control algorithms. However, these algorithms can struggle with the mutual interference between indoor temperature and humidity, resulting in frequent system fluctuations and control oscillations [14,15]. Despite the simplicity and ease of implementation of PID systems, external uncertainties like environmental changes and the status of doors and windows can compromise control effectiveness [16,17]. To enhance system performance, various methods such as air-side economizers [18], flow conditioners [19], predictive controllers [20], damper position and fan frequency regulation strategies [21], Smith predictive compensation [22], artificial neural networks [23], and predictive control model [24] have been explored. While these approaches have shown promise, they often fail to provide a comprehensive description of both the air conditioning system and the building structure, hindering their ability to fully capture the lag response characteristics essential for effective control. Furthermore, these studies often rely on offline data, simulations, or databases, limiting their applicability in real-time, practical engineering scenarios. Recent strategies include Yang et al.\u2019s [20] use of a recurrent neural network (RNN) model to adjust compressor speed and fan frequency, and Seyed et al.'s [25] radial basis function neural network with epsilon constraint (EC-RBFNN) algorithm for optimizing PID controllers, though these too have limitations in adapting quickly to changing environmental conditions. Raman et al. [26] implemented a model predictive controller (MPC) in a VAV system but did not consider building heat transfer, crucial for describing the delayed response in temperature and humidity regulation. Given these limitations, there is a pressing need for an intelligent model that comprehensively addresses the relationship between indoor temperature, humidity, and various influencing factors to enhance the adaptability and efficiency of air conditioning systems. With the advancement of artificial intelligence technology, artificial neural networks are increasingly applied to the predictive control of indoor temperature and humidity in air conditioning systems. Shi et al. [27] developed a BP neural network model for predicting indoor conditions in a tobacco factory warehouse, demonstrating good predictive performance. Similarly, Chen et al. [28] employed deep recurrent neural networks to effectively capture and predict dynamic changes in indoor temperature, humidity, and natural ventilation. Behrooz et al. [29,30] explored the use of a fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) for HVAC systems, designing a nonlinear robust controller with strong online learning capabilities and resistance to disturbances, particularly in direct expansion air conditioning systems. These studies highlight the balance between high-performance prediction and interpretability, which often are mutually exclusive due to the nonlinear and time-varying characteristics of multi-zone indoor environments. Further advancing this field, Wang et al. [31] integrated deep neural network capabilities into the FCM model, creating a deep fuzzy cognitive map (DFCM) that was applied to diverse prediction tasks such as air quality indexes and room temperatures. The DFCM model demonstrated high accuracy and interpretability, achieving significant predictive success across various applications, including health diagnostics and defect detection in industrial components as evidenced by Feleki et al. [32] and Tziolas et al. [33]. These findings suggest that while existing models offer robust solutions for specific conditions, challenges remain in real-time prediction and control in complex environments like multi-zone VAV systems. Thus, further development of intelligent models, such as the DFCM, that can dynamically adapt to changing environmental conditions is essential for enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of predictive control systems. In this study, we establish a dynamic predictive control model for managing indoor temperature and humidity in a multi-zone VAV air conditioning system. This model integrates a multi-zone building model, a DFCM model, and a PID controller. Initially, we develop a multi-zone building model capable of accurately and in real-time calculating indoor temperature and humidity, utilizing the RC network two-node wall structure method. The calculated values from this building model then replace actual measurements for the DFCM model to predict future indoor conditions. Subsequently, the PID controller uses these predictions and the preset temperature and humidity targets to precisely adjust the openings of terminal air valves and chilled water valves in the VAV system. To assess the model's performance, we applied it under various weather conditions (sunny, overcast, and rainy days) within the same building. This evaluation aimed to test the model's effectiveness in accurately predicting and controlling indoor climate across different environmental scenarios. 2 Research methodology 2.1 Establishment of a single-room model 2.1.1 Room model A standard office room was selected for analysis, measuring 5 m in length, 4 m in width, and 3 m in height, with a total volume of 60 m3, as illustrated in Fig. 1 . The room is divided into three typical zones: the air-supply zone, the work zone [12,13], and the air-return zone, detailed in Fig. 2 . In this study, the wall is modeled as being divided into two layers, detailed in Fig. 3 . The distribution of thickness across these layers is allocated such that the sections from the wall's outer surface to the second node, between the two internal nodes, and from the first node to the wall's inner surface each represent 1/4, 1/2, and 1/4 of the total wall thickness, respectively. The temperatures at various points are denoted as follows: T out represents the outdoor temperature, T wa,out the temperature at the wall's outer surface, T wa1 the temperature at the first internal node, T wa2 the temperature at the second internal node, T wa,in the temperature at the wall's inner surface, and T in the indoor temperature. The heat capacity of the wall is represented by C wa , and its heat resistance is denoted by δ w a λ w a . The ceiling and floor are divided similarly into two layers, ensuring consistent thermal modeling throughout the building structure. The dynamic change process of indoor temperature and humidity is influenced by multiple factors [34]. To reduce the complexity and computational intensity of the model, the transfer of humidity through the building envelope is not considered. In order to establish a simple and practical multi-zone building model that accurately describes the complex heat transfer processes of the building envelope, the following assumptions need to be made: (1) Consider only one-dimensional heat transfer in the building envelope, specifically perpendicular to the wall surfaces. (2) Ignore the transfer of humidity through the building envelope. (3) Disregard the effect of wind speed on the temperature of the wall's outer surface. (4) Treat doors and windows as analogous to electrical resistances. (5) Assume uniform air distribution within the air-supply zone, work zone, and air-return zone. In the construction of our model, the exclusion of humidity transfer through the building envelope was a deliberate decision based on the specific aims and design constraints of our study. The primary focus was on the dynamic control of air temperatures within multi-zone VAV air conditioning systems, where thermal transfer is predominant. The inclusion of humidity transfer mechanisms such as capillary action and diffusion would have significantly increased the complexity and computational demands of the model, without proportionately enhancing the model\u2019s performance for its intended application in temperature regulation. Therefore, to maintain computational efficiency and focus, these aspects were not incorporated into the current model framework. 2.1.2 Energy and humidity balance equations for the single room Due to the temperature difference between indoor and outdoor environments, energy is transferred through the building envelope. This transfer process can be effectively analyzed using energy balance theory. The following presents the energy balance equation for a single node within the building envelope: (1) E T = E T 1 − E T 2 where ET is the change in energy of a single node per unit time, kJ, ET 1 is the energy input to the node per unit time, kJ, and ET 2 is the energy output from the node per unit time, kJ. Assuming energy transfer occurs from the outer to the inner surface of the building envelope, it is necessary to employ energy balance theory to analyze the process at each nodal temperature within the envelope.

(16)\u2013(19) for each node in the building envelope and the temperature and humidity instantaneous response Eqs. (20)\u2013(25) for each zone in the air-conditioned room collectively form the single-room model. To expand this model to encompass multiple zones within a building, the equations from the single-room model, specifically Eqs.

Detailed expressions for matrices A, B and C are provided in Appendix A. Eq. (26) comprehensively models the heat transfer process within the building envelope and accounts for the effects of instantaneous loads entering the room through various channels on indoor temperature and humidity. Additionally, it incorporates the coupling relationship between temperature and humidity within the room. 2.2 Establishment of the multi-zone building model Assuming a building comprises z rooms, as illustrated in Fig. 1, numbered from 1 to z, the single-room model described by Eq. (26) is expanded to encompass the entire multi-zone building. Consequently, the following expression for the multi-zone building model is derived: (31) [ X 1 \u2032 ⋮ X i \u2032 ⋮ X z \u2032 ] = [ A 1 0 0 ⋯ 0 ⋮ ⋮ ⋮ ⋱ 0 0 0 A i ⋯ 0 ⋮ ⋮ ⋮ ⋱ ⋮ 0 0 0 ⋯ A z ] [ X 1 ⋮ X i ⋮ X z ] + [ B 1 0 0 ⋯ 0 ⋮ ⋮ ⋮ ⋱ 0 0 0 B i ⋯ 0 ⋮ ⋮ ⋮ ⋱ ⋮ 0 0 0 ⋮ B z ] [ I 1 ⋮ I i ⋮ I z ] + [ C 1 0 0 ⋯ 0 ⋮ ⋮ ⋮ ⋱ 0 0 0 C i ⋯ 0 ⋮ ⋮ ⋮ ⋱ ⋮ 0 0 0 ⋯ C z ] [ U 1 ⋮ U i ⋮ U z ] where A i is the system coefficient matrix for the i-th room, B i is the input coefficient matrix for the i-th room, C i is the disturbance coefficient matrix for the i-th room, X' I is the calculated value vector for the i-th room, X i is the actual value vector for the i-th room, I i is the input value vector for the i-th room, and U i is the disturbance vector for the i-th room, i = 1, 2, 3, \u2026, z. Based on the indoor and outdoor environmental parameters of each room and the regulating variables of the VAV air conditioning system at time t − Δ t , Eq. (31) can accurately calculate the indoor temperature and humidity for each room at the time t. 2.3 Establishment of an indoor temperature and humidity prediction control model 2.3.1 Deep fuzzy cognitive map model The DFCM model, which integrates deep neural network technology with FCM [37], exhibits exceptional interpretability and predictive accuracy [38,39]. Fig. 4 illustrates the structure of the DFCM model. In this model, a i (t) is the i-th influencing factor of indoor temperature and humidity at time t, T p (t+1) is the predicted indoor temperature at time t+1, and M p (t+1) is the predicted indoor humidity at time t+1. The DFCM model adeptly manages the nonlinear relationships between influencing factors of indoor temperature and humidity and various exogenous factors, providing accurate predictions of these conditions, which exhibit strong coupling and time variability, at time t+1 based on data from time tt. The model incorporates distinct hidden layers within both the f-function and u-function, enabling the integration of multiple time series data. The f-function constructs the feedforward neural network structure of the DFCM model, addressing the nonlinear relationships between the influencing factors of indoor temperature and humidity. The u-function indirectly assesses the impact of exogenous factors on indoor temperature and humidity. This structure allows the DFCM model to perform robust predictions and analyses of indoor climate variables. 2.3.2 Predictive control process of indoor temperature and humidity This study develops a dynamic predictive control model for managing indoor temperature and humidity in a multi-zone VAV air-conditioning system by integrating the multi-zone building model, DFCM model, and PID control algorithm. The structure of the model is illustrated in Fig. 5 . Firstly, the multi-zone building model calculates the current room temperature T(t), and humidity M(t). Inputs to the DFCM model include the current supply air temperature T s (t), room temperature T(t), the first derivative of room temperature Tʹ(t) = T(t)-T(t-1), current room humidity M(t), the first derivative of room humidity Mʹ(t) = M(t)-M(t-1), current supply air volume Q(t), and supply air humidity M s (t). The outputs are the predicted room temperature T p (t+1), and humidity M p (t +1), for the next moment. PID controllers then calculate the regulating variables for the terminal air dampers based on the difference between the predicted room temperature T p (t+1), and the setpoint T sp . The damper\u2019s opening degree is adjusted periodically according to the control cycle S c to regulate the air volume entering the room. Similarly, the chilled water valve\u2019s regulating variable is determined by the difference between the predicted room humidity M p (t+1), and its setpoint M sp , with adjustments made periodically to control the temperature and humidity of the supply air. Changes in the opening degree of the terminal air damper also affect the static pressure in the supply air duct. To manage the effects of these pressure changes on room air supply volume, a constant static pressure control method controls the fan speed. Direct digital control (DDC) of the fan inverter adjusts the fan speed based on air supply duct static pressure changes, maintaining stable duct pressure. To prevent the mismatch between the multi-zone building model and the DFCM model from affecting the prediction accuracy, a threshold Er is established to monitor the DFCM model's training. Er represents the discrepancy between the room temperature T(t) calculated by the multi-zone building model and the room temperature T p (t +1) predicted by the DFCM model. Based on extensive training sessions, Er is set at 0.5 to ensure reliable model outputs. Training of the DFCM model is managed as follows: ● If |Er|≤0.5, the DFCM model ceases training, and the predicted room temperature T p (t+1) and humidity M p (t+1) for the next interval are output. ● If |Er|>0.5, training continues until |Er| falls below 0.5 or the duration reaches the predetermined control cycle time. 2.4 Overall strategic framework of the model The dynamic predictive control model for managing multi-zone indoor temperature and humidity in a VAV air-conditioning system operates in three main steps, as illustrated in Fig. 6 . Firstly, a multi-zone building model is established to calculate the current indoor temperature and humidity across multiple zones. Secondly, the DFCM model predicts the indoor temperature and humidity for the subsequent moment. Finally, a PID controller adjusts the opening degrees of the terminal air dampers and chilled water valves based on the setpoints for indoor temperature and humidity. Concurrently, the fan's speed is regulated by the DDC system of the fan inverter to maintain optimal airflow and efficiency. 3 Experimental validation of the model 3.1 Description of experimental system The model is implemented on a networked control platform within a VAV air-conditioning system for a large commercial building in Guilin, China, covering a total floor area of 131,000 m2. This platform integrates an advanced automatic control system, equipped with various actuators, sensors, and server software, along with SIMATIC S7-1200 programmable controllers. The server software facilitates communication via the Modbus TCP protocol with the SIMATIC S7-1200 programmable controller, ensuring robust communication performance. This setup not only enhances the system's functionality but also supports convenient online applications, crucial for real-time control and monitoring. The control structure of the multi-zone VAV air conditioning system is depicted in Fig. 7 . Located in the southwest corner of a large commercial building, three structurally identical rooms, designated as Room 1, Room 2, and Room 3, form the core of this study. These rooms are situated adjacent to each other without any separating hallways, exposing each room's external walls either to the outdoor environment or to a corridor. This configuration plays a significant role in influencing their thermal behavior due to varying exposures. Each room features external walls that are critical in defining their thermal dynamics. Specifically, the doors of all three rooms face the corridor, aligning consistently along one corridor-facing wall, while the windows are situated on the external walls, all facing the same direction. Room 1 and Room 3 are uniquely positioned with one of their walls directly exposed to the external environment and another wall featuring windows also facing outdoors. Additionally, their corridor-facing walls, where the doors are located, further affect their interaction with the building's thermal environment. Room 2, while similar, differs slightly in that it has one windowed external wall exposed to the outdoors and its door-wall situated along the corridor, leading to potentially different thermal characteristics compared to the corner rooms. Each room measures 5 m in length, 3 m in width, and 3.4 m in height, totaling a volume of 51 m³ and is constructed with clay brick walls. Fig. 8 illustrates the interior layout of these rooms. Terminal air volume is regulated by air dampers, labeled VB1, VB2, and VB3, within the VAV system. The system's air supply volume ranges from 66 m³/h to 550 m³/h. The building envelope parameters were recorded using the R90V building multi-channel temperature and heat flow detector, achieving a measurement accuracy of ±0.05 %. Temperature and humidity data for the supply air are sourced from the networked control platform of the VAV system. Indoor temperature and humidity were monitored using Si7021-A20-IM digital sensors, which provide a temperature accuracy of ±0.4 °C and a relative humidity accuracy of ±3 %. Outdoor environmental conditions were measured with Honeywell HSH-M2A sensors, offering a temperature accuracy of ±0.3 °C and a relative humidity accuracy of ±2 %. Details of the building envelope and the indoor and outdoor environmental parameters are enumerated in Table 1 . Sensors were strategically placed at multiple key locations within the room, including near supply ducts, doors, and work zones. This arrangement allows us to obtain temperature and humidity data from various perspectives. 3.2 Data collection Parameters of both the indoor and outdoor environments, along with real-time operational data from the VAV air conditioning system, are required to train the predictive control model. This data collection helps determine the optimal parameters and the threshold (Er) for the DFCM model. Environmental parameters include indoor and outdoor temperatures and humidity, as well as solar radiation intensity. Operational data from the VAV system encompasses the temperature and humidity of the supply air, the volume of supply air, and the opening of both the terminal air damper and the chilled water valve. The terminal air damper of the VAV air conditioning system, which features equal percentage characteristics, operates from 0 to 100 % within 1 min in the actual control process; therefore, the data sampling interval is set at 1 min. On June 11, 2022, from 10:00 to 22:00, a total of 720 sets of indoor and outdoor environmental parameters from Room 1, along with real-time operational data from the VAV air conditioning system, were collected, as illustrated in Fig. 9 . Given that the humidity ratio provides an accurate reflection of the water vapor content in the air, the measured relative humidity and temperature were converted to humidity ratios to more intuitively display changes in air humidity [13,40]. Indoor temperature and humidity were measured using the Si7021-A20-IM digital temperature and humidity sensor, which has a temperature error of ±0.4 °C and a relative humidity error of ±3 %. Outdoor temperature and humidity were measured with the Honeywell HSH-M2A sensor, which exhibits a temperature error of ±0.3 °C and a relative humidity error of ±2 %. The intensity of outdoor radiation was gauged using the SM206 solar meter, which features an error range of ±10 W/m2. 4 Results and discussion 4.1 Verification of the multi-zone building model 4.1.1 Calculation of the indoor temperature and humidity ratio in a single room To verify the computational accuracy of the single-room model, experiments were conducted in Room 2 over a duration of 480 min. The VAV air conditioning system supplied a specific quantity of cold air to Room 2 with a supply air temperature of 10 °C and a humidity ratio of 6.86 g/kg dry air, and the air mass flow rate was 0.08 kg/s. The indoor air temperature and humidity ratio in Room 2 stabilized after a period, and the air conditioniang system was then turned off at the 240-min mark. During the experiment, the average indoor temperature and humidity ratio downstairs were 26 °C and 10.1 g/kg dry air, respectively, while the average outdoor temperature, humidity ratio, and solar radiation intensity were recorded as 33.5 °C, 18.6 g/kg dry air, and 834.6 W/m2, respectively. Fig. 10 depicts the comparison between the calculated real-time change values and the actual values of temperature and humidity ratio in Room 2 over a period of 480 min. The alignment of calculated and observed trends in Fig. 10, despite being based on a series of computational approximations, the results are derived from a robust integration of the RC network model and the backward finite difference method. The RC network, employed to simplify the heat transfer process within the building envelope, uses a two-node wall structure that effectively balances computational simplicity with the need for physical accuracy. This method captures the main thermal characteristics by dividing the wall into distinct thermal zones, each represented by its thermal capacitance and resistance, which significantly reduces the complexity of the heat transfer equations while maintaining essential accuracy. Moreover, the backward finite difference scheme is utilized to discretize these equations over time, providing a more accurate representation of the transient behaviors. This approach not only enhances the stability of the solution but also improves the accuracy of temperature and humidity predictions under dynamic conditions. The discrepancies between the actual and calculated values of room temperature and humidity ratio are less than 0.4 °C and 0.05 g/(kg dry air), respectively. During the first 240 min, the actual values of room temperature and humidity ratio were slightly higher than the calculated values, while in the latter 240 min, they were slightly lower. This variation may be attributed to the delayed response of the indoor temperature and humidity ratio to changes in outdoor environmental conditions and the regulating variables of the VAV air conditioning system. The results demonstrate that the single-room model effectively captures the delayed response characteristics of indoor temperature and humidity during adjustment processes and can accurately compute the indoor temperature and humidity ratio in real time. 4.1.2 Calculation of the indoor temperature and humidity ratio in a multi-room environment The indoor temperature and humidity ratios in Room 1, Room 2, and Room 3 were calculated using the multi-zone building model. The experimental procedure employed in the multi-room setting mirrored that of the single-room experiment and lasted for 480 min. For the first 240 min, the VAV air conditioning system supplied an identical amount of cold air to each of the three rooms, after which it was turned off. The parameters of the supplied air were as follows: temperature 10 °C, humidity ratio 6.86 g/(kg dry air), and mass flow rate 0.08 kg/s. During the data collection process, the measured average temperature and humidity ratio downstairs were 25.9 °C and 10.7 g/(kg dry air), respectively. Concurrently, the average outdoor temperature was 34.7 °C, the humidity ratio was 13.2 g/(kg dry air), and the solar radiation intensity was 1524.8 W/m2. Fig. 11 illustrates the comparison between the calculated and actual values of temperature and humidity ratios in Room 1, Room 2, and Room 3 over 480 min. The temperature and humidity ratios in the three rooms change synchronously, with the errors between the actual and calculated values being less than 0.4 °C and 0.05 g/(kg dry air), respectively. Notably, as shown in Fig. 11(b), the temperature in Room 2 stabilizes between 160 and 240 min, which is significantly quicker than in Room 1 (Fig. 11(a)) and Room 3 (Fig. 11(c)). Room 2, positioned between Rooms 1 and 3, features only one external wall. This structural attribute results in diminished exposure to external temperature fluctuations, contributing to a more stabilized thermal environment compared to Rooms 1 and 3, each with two external walls. At the end of the experiment, the humidity ratios in all three rooms are higher than their initial values, indicative of the air initially being dry and becoming more humid as the air conditioning system supplied moist air. These results affirm that the multi-zone building model accurately and effectively calculates the indoor temperature and humidity ratios in real-time. 4.2 Predictive control of indoor temperature and humidity In this study, the DFCM model, integrated with the multi-zone building model, is loaded into Simulink PLC Coder. Subsequently, the generated source code is imported into the SIMATIC S7-1200 programmable controller. The opening of the terminal air damper and the chilled water valve in VAV air conditioning systems is controlled in real-time to maintain the indoor temperature and humidity within the predefined value range. 4.2.1 Control period for indoor temperature and humidity ratio In this study, the relationship between the opening of the terminal air damper in the VAV air conditioning system and indoor temperature and humidity was investigated to determine the delayed response time. Although changes in the air volume within the room occur immediately with adjustments to the damper, changes in indoor temperature and humidity do not; they exhibit a noticeable delay. The focus of this analysis is to quantify this delay time when the damper's opening varies between 30 % and 100 %, aiming to ensure optimal indoor air quality. Fig. 12 (a) depicts the response curves of indoor temperature in three rooms following adjustments to the terminal air damper. Initially, the damper in the VAV junction box was maintained at a minimum opening from 14:00 to 14:20. At 14:20, the damper opening was manually increased from 30 % to 100 %, resulting in a significant temperature drop across all three rooms by 14:24. Conversely, at 14:40, the damper opening was reduced from 100 % to 30 %, causing the temperature to rise significantly by 14:44. Fig. 12(b) illustrates the corresponding changes in humidity ratios, which also exhibited significant shifts 4 min post-adjustment. These experiments confirm a delayed response time of approximately 4 min for both temperature and humidity changes relative to damper adjustments. To enhance the stability of the predictive control model and prevent frequent adjustments, the control period for the indoor temperature and humidity ratios was set to 4 min. 4.2.2 Determination of parameters for the predictive control model The mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and R-square (R 2) were used to evaluate the prediction performance of the DFCM model under various configurations of hidden layers and neuron counts. A smaller MAE indicates reduced prediction error, while a lower RMSE suggests a smaller deviation between predicted and actual values. An R 2 value closer to 1 indicates a better fit of the model. The formulas for these metrics are presented as follows: (35) M A E = 1 T ∑ t = 1 T | x ˆ ( t ) − x ( t ) | (36) R M S E = 1 T ∑ t = 1 T ( x ˆ ( t ) − x ( t ) ) 2 (37) R 2 = 1 − ∑ t = 1 T ( x ˆ ( t ) − x ( t ) ) 2 ∑ t = 1 T ( x \u203e ( t ) − x ( t ) ) 2 where x ( t ) is the actual value of the indoor temperature at time t, x ˆ ( t ) is the predicted value of the indoor temperature at time t, x \u203e ( t ) is the indoor average temperature, and t represents the length of the time series. To determine the optimal number of hidden layers for the f-function and u-function, the values of MAE, RMSE, and R 2 for each function under various configurations of hidden layers were calculated and are illustrated in Fig. 13 . In this figure, darker shades of blue indicate smaller values, lighter shades represent larger values, and white denotes the largest values. Analysis of Fig. 13 reveals that the minimum values for RMSE and MAE are 3.224 and 2.964, respectively, with the maximum R 2 value being 0.864. The optimal number of hidden layers is five for the f-function and two for the u-function, at which the DFCM model demonstrates the best prediction performance. 4.3 Predictive control of the indoor temperature and humidity ratio The predictive control model was employed to regulate the indoor temperature and humidity ratio in Room 1, Room 2, and Room 3 on a fine day. Initially, the temperatures in these rooms were 30.5 °C, 29.4 °C, and 30.8 °C, respectively, with humidity ratios of 16.52 g/(kg dry air), 15.48 g/(kg dry air), and 16.81 g/(kg dry air). After running the multi-zone VAV air conditioning system for 180 min, the indoor conditions in all three rooms aligned with the set parameters. The temperature maintained a fluctuation within ±0.5 °C of the set value, and the humidity ratio within ±0.1 g/(kg dry air). Fig. 14 illustrates the changing curves of the indoor temperature and humidity ratio for the three rooms. (I) and (II) of Fig. 14(a) and (b) show that the trend of temperature and humidity ratio changes in Room 1 and Room 2 are similar, though the temperature changes have a noticeably larger amplitude than those of the humidity. This is likely due to the coupling between temperature and humidity, where the humidity ratio adjusts in response to temperature changes. Additionally, the smaller amplitude in humidity changes can be attributed to the exclusion of moisture transfer through the building envelope, which minimizes the impact of outdoor conditions on indoor humidity levels. During an experiment where the window in Room 3 was opened from 10:55 to 11:30, as highlighted in yellow in (III) of Fig. 14 (a)\u2013(b), the temperature and humidity load increased. The predictive control model, due to not adjusting its parameters promptly in response to these sudden environmental changes, exhibited some deviations between the predicted and actual values. However, with an error magnitude of |Er|≤0.5, the model effectively adjusted the indoor conditions by modifying the air damper and chilled water valve openings, as well as the air supply volume, temperature, and humidity. A quantitative evaluation of the DFCM model's predictive accuracy for indoor temperature and humidity ratio in Rooms 1, 2, and 3 on a fine day has been conducted. The calculated results for MAE, RMSE, and the R 2 are presented in Table 2 . The data clearly indicates that the MAE, RMSE, and R 2 for all three rooms meet the established criteria for evaluation. These results demonstrate the high predictive accuracy and strong generalization capability of the DFCM model. The predictive control model was utilized to predict and control the indoor temperature and humidity ratio in Room 1, Room 2, and Room 3 on an overcast day. Initially, the temperatures in these rooms were 29.2 °C, 28.8 °C, and 30.1 °C, respectively, with humidity ratios of 17.4 g/(kg dry air), 16.05 g/(kg dry air), and 18.91 g/(kg dry air). Fig. 15 illustrates the changing curves of the indoor temperature and humidity ratio for the three rooms under overcast conditions. Under these conditions, both the fluctuation range and frequency of the temperature and humidity curves were reduced. This reduction can be attributed to lower solar radiation and cooler outdoor temperatures, which decrease the heat load entering the rooms through the building envelope. It is evident that there is a significant divergence between the predicted and actual temperatures in Rooms 1, 2, and 3, with particularly pronounced discrepancies observed in Room 2. The predictive trend for the temperature in Room 2 is markedly flatter and fails to accurately replicate the observed peaks and troughs. This discrepancy may stem from the predictive model's inadequate response to subtle environmental variations on overcast days, notably for Room 2 which is located between Rooms 1 and 3. The model demonstrates reduced sensitivity and adaptability to slight fluctuations in Room 2\u2019s internal and external environments. Notably, as highlighted in the yellow shaded areas of Fig. 14(a)\u2013(b) and Fig. 15(a)-(b), the amplitude of temperature and humidity changes in Room 3 between 10:55 and 11:30 on the overcast day was significantly smaller compared to a fine day. This difference is likely due to the reduced heat and humidity load entering through the window. The predictive control model adeptly adjusts the opening of the terminal air damper and the chilled water valve in the VAV air conditioning system in response to varying outdoor conditions. It controls the air supply volume, temperature, and humidity ratio effectively, enabling quick and precise adjustments to the indoor climate. A quantitative evaluation of the DFCM model's performance in predicting indoor temperature and humidity for Rooms 1, 2, and 3 on an overcast day is detailed in Table 3 . The model shows varying degrees of accuracy across the rooms, with Room 2 exhibiting the highest MAE and RMSE for temperature predictions at 0.2579 and 0.3215, respectively, and the lowest R 2 at 0.7558. This deviation is attributed to Room 2's central location between Rooms 1 and 3, which may reduce the impact of external environmental fluctuations on it, thereby affecting model fit. In contrast, the R 2 values for temperature predictions in Rooms 1 and 3 exceed 0.92, indicating strong model performance. However, Room 2's R 2 is below 0.8, suggesting the model might overemphasize or underemphasize inputs such as solar radiation and outdoor temperatures, impacting its accuracy during atypical conditions. For humidity predictions, the model performs well, with all three rooms achieving R 2 values over 0.92, demonstrating the model's ability to deliver high-fidelity forecasts relative to the observed data variability. The predictive control model was employed to predict and manage the indoor temperature and humidity ratio in Rooms 1, 2, and 3 on a rainy day. Initially, the temperatures were 27.9 °C in Room 1, 27.2 °C in Room 2, and 28.1 °C in Room 3, with humidity ratios of 17.81 g/(kg dry air), 16.60 g/(kg dry air), and 18.27 g/(kg dry air), respectively. Fig. 16 depicts the changing curves of the indoor temperature and humidity ratios in these rooms. On rainy days, the fluctuations in temperature and humidity in all three rooms were narrower compared to fine and overcast days, and the time taken for the humidity ratio to first reach the set value was significantly longer. Evaluating the performance of the predictive control model on fine, overcast, and rainy days demonstrates that the model not only predicts and controls the indoor temperature and humidity ratio accurately but also exhibits strong resistance to interference and adaptability to varying indoor and outdoor conditions. A quantitative assessment of the DFCM model's predictive accuracy for indoor temperature and humidity in Rooms 1, 2, and 3 during rainy conditions is presented in Table 4 . Notably, the model exhibits the highest MAE and RMSE values for temperature predictions in Room 2, at 0.1535 and 0.1920 respectively, with a corresponding R 2 of 0.7935, indicating a reduced fit compared to sunny and overcast conditions. This diminished accuracy may be attributed to the lower heat load entering indoors during rain. For humidity predictions, the largest MAE and RMSE are observed in Room 1, at 0.2000 and 0.2330 respectively, with an R 2 of 0.9713. Despite these high R 2 values, the model's precision in predicting humidity ratios on rainy days is lower than on sunny or overcast days, likely due to increased indoor moisture loads during rainfall. An excellent dynamic predictive control model for indoor temperature and humidity in multi-zone VAV air conditioning systems must accurately predict and control the indoor temperature and humidity ratio in each room, as well as precisely regulate the opening of terminal air dampers and chilled water valves. Fig. 17 illustrates the changing curves of air volume, air damper positions in three rooms, supply air temperature, humidity ratio, and the chilled water valve opening. As depicted in Fig. 17 (a)\u2013(b), the air volume and damper positions in the three rooms change synchronously. Fig. 17 (c)\u2013(d) shows that the supply air temperature and humidity ratio follow the same curve variation trend, which is controlled by the opening of the chilled water valve. Notably, an increase in the chilled water valve opening leads to a decrease in both temperature and humidity ratio of the supply air, as evidenced by the inverse relationship shown in Fig. 17 (e). In response to real-time changes in indoor and outdoor environments, the predictive control model can adjust the chilled water valve opening in real-time, effectively controlling the temperature and humidity ratio of the supply air. Furthermore, the model integrates the multi-zone building model, DFCM model, and PID controller to precisely manage the openings of the terminal air dampers and chilled water valves. This integration allows for adjustments in the air supply volume and the temperature and humidity ratios, thereby ensuring that indoor conditions meet set values. Additionally, the dynamic predictive control model prevents frequent fluctuations in the openings of the terminal air dampers and chilled water valves, thereby reducing the operational energy consumption of the multi-zone VAV air conditioning system. In the development of our dynamic predictive control model, the influence of external wind speed on convective heat transfer was not explicitly modeled. This decision was guided by the primary focus of our study, which is the internal management of temperature and humidity within environments primarily influenced by mechanical ventilation systems rather than natural airflow. The RC network method employed in our study effectively simulates the thermal dynamics of the building envelope but simplifies the interaction with external environmental factors, including wind. This simplification is a strategic trade-off to reduce the model's computational complexity and enhance its responsiveness and feasibility for real-time applications. Future versions of this model could integrate modifications to include wind speed effects, potentially through coupled computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations or semi-empirical modifications to the existing RC network, to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of these dynamics. Looking forward, we recognize the need to incorporate more detailed analyses into our model to address the effects of non-uniform air distribution observed in practical HVAC applications. Employing zonal modeling or CFD will enable us to simulate airflow patterns within rooms more precisely, capturing stagnant zones and localized variations in environmental conditions. These enhancements will not only improve our model's predictive accuracy regarding temperature and humidity but also optimize energy efficiency and comfort levels. In the current phase of the predictive control model research, rooms were modeled without occupancy to establish baseline control performance and isolate the influence of the HVAC system. The absence of occupancy dynamics in the model is a limitation, as occupant activities such as movement, door operations, and equipment use contribute to a more transient and variable indoor environment, thereby affecting both thermal comfort and energy efficiency.To more accurately reflect real-world conditions and enhance the applicability of HVAC control system, future developments will include the integration of occupancy sensors and predictive occupancy models. These enhancements will allow for dynamic adjustments of control settings based on real-time data, effectively managing the stochastic nature of occupancy effects. This advancement aims to bridge the gap between experimental control scenarios and typical operational conditions, thereby improving both the precision and practicality of our model. 5 Conclusions To effectively predict and control the indoor temperature and humidity in real-time for multi-zone VAV air conditioning systems, this study developed a dynamic predictive control model based on a multi-zone building model, the DFCM model, and a PID controller. The model addresses the nonlinear relationships between the indoor temperature and humidity and other exogenous influencing factors. It precisely controls the openings of the terminal air dampers and chilled water valves, facilitating real-time management of the indoor climate. Applied to a networked control platform within a large commercial building, the model was tested under various weather conditions (sunny, overcast, and rainy days). The comparative analysis of prediction and control performances for indoor temperature and humidity across different conditions led to the following conclusions: (1) The multi-zone building model, which utilizes the RC network two-node wall structure method, can accurately calculate the indoor temperature and humidity ratio. The discrepancies between the actual and calculated values of room temperature and humidity ratio are consistently less than 0.4 °C and 0.05 g/(kg dry air), respectively. (2) The dynamic predictive control model for indoor temperature and humidity in a multi-zone VAV air conditioning system integrates the multi-zone building model, DFCM model, and PID controller. This model can accurately predict and control the indoor temperature and humidity ratio by adapting to real-time changes in indoor and outdoor environments. Over a monitored period, the model maintained the indoor temperature and humidity ratio within a range of ±0.5 °C and ±0.1 g/(kg dry air) from the set values, respectively. (3) The dynamic predictive control model for indoor temperature and humidity in a multi-zone VAV air conditioning system demonstrates robust anti-interference capabilities. It accurately and consistently controls the opening degrees of the terminal air dampers and chilled water valves, and dynamically adjusts the air volume, supply air temperature, and humidity ratio based on real-time environmental conditions. This ensures optimal indoor climate control under varying operational settings.

        "dc:description": "Model-based predictive control has proven effective for managing indoor temperature and humidity in variable air volume (VAV) air conditioning systems. However, delays in temperature and humidity adjustments in response to changes in internal and external environmental conditions can impede high-performance operation. This study introduces a dynamic predictive control model for the multi-zone indoor temperature and humidity of VAV systems, designed to predict and control these parameters in real-time. Utilizing the RC network two-node wall structure method and backward finite difference scheme, a multi-zone building model is developed. Coupled with a deep fuzzy cognitive map (DFCM) for temperature and humidity prediction, and controlled by a PID controller, the model dynamically regulates the opening degrees of terminal air dampers and chilled water valves. Implemented on a networked control platform in a large commercial building, the model consistently maintained indoor temperature and humidity within ±0.5 °C and ±0.1 g/(kg dry air) of the target values under varying conditions, demonstrating substantial improvements in stability and operational efficiency. The research enhances the predictability and control of HVAC systems through advanced algorithmic integration, improving real-time indoor climate management in complex building environments. This method offers a practical improvement in HVAC control technologies, which could be beneficial for applications in commercial building management systems, providing a useful tool for supporting energy efficiency and sustainability in modern infrastructures.",
