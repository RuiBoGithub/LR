Graphical abstract The transition to a more sustainable energy system with a growing amount of intermittent renewable energy sources brings an increasing need for flexibility measures to maintain balance between supply and demand. Buildings represent a promising source of demand-side flexibility due to their large energy demand and thermal mass. This review provides insights into the storage potential of building thermal mass, and the benefits and challenges it brings. It is found that building thermal mass storage have good ability to shift loads on short term, from peak to off-peak hours. This ability can be utilized for different purposes, for instance reduced costs for end-users or energy providers, reduced primary energy demand, or reduced CO2 emissions. Furthermore, this review explores different factors that influence the storage potential of building thermal mass, with special attention paid to the heat emission system. It is shown that hydronic floor heating is beneficial compared to radiators since it directly can activate the thermal mass with smaller impact on the indoor temperature. It is also found that the factor with largest impact is the envelope insulation level; increased insulation level brings improved storage efficiency and prolonged thermal autonomy but also decreased storage capacity and increased risk of overheating. Finally, research gaps are identified.

Historically, this balance has mainly been handled by the supply side, but with an increasing penetration of RESs, the demand side gets more and more involved [3]. Buildings are increasingly seen as a potential source of demand-side flexibility due to their large energy demand and thermal mass [2,4]. The flexibility is provided by adjusting the energy use according to the needs of the energy system [5]. Certainly, buildings have been used for balancing purposes even before, but it has mainly been limited to large commercial and industrial customers [6]. With an increasing share of RESs, it may be beneficial also for other kinds of buildings, like residential buildings, to participate and provide flexibility [7]. Thermal energy storage (TES) in building thermal mass (BTM) has been described as a cost-effective storage technology with great potential [1,5,8\u201312]. BTM has the advantage of low investment costs since the thermal mass is readily available, the only needed investments are related to control equipment [2]. A limitation of BTM, however, is that the storage potential is constrained by the occupant́s acceptance of temperature changes [9], at least during the periods when the occupants are staying in the building. In contrast to many other storage technologies (e.g., water tanks), the storage potential of BTM depends on numerous factors and varies over time [12,13]. The potential is influenced by the insulation level of the building envelope, available amount of thermal mass, heat emission system, accepted indoor temperature variations, and boundary conditions like ambient outdoor temperature, solar radiation and internal gains [10,12\u201316]. Additionally, the interaction between the thermal mass and the heat emission system is of great importance [17]. 1.1 Previous reviews Several reviews have been provided on energy flexibility of buildings. Luo et al. [18] published a review on the flexibility of residential buildings focusing on definitions, flexible loads and quantification methods, Li et al. [6] focused on characterization and quantification of energy flexibility, and Pallonetto et al. [19] provided a review on demand response programs in residential buildings. Vandermeulen et al. [20] carried out a review on flexibility control in the context of district heating and cooling systems, and Pean et al. [21] reviewed control strategies for flexibility improvement of heat pumps (HPs) in buildings. Heier et al. [22] published a review on TES technologies focusing on the combination of storage technology and building type, Taylor et al. [23] provided an overview and comparison of available TES technologies, Arteconi et al. [24] reviewed present applications of thermal storage used for demand-side management, and Guelpa and Verda [25] carried out a review on TES technologies implemented in district heating (DH) systems. Behzadi et al. [26] published a review on smart design of TES in low-temperature heating (LTH) systems, and Kohlhepp et al. [27] reviewed international field studies where grid integration of residential TESs were tested at large scale. The topic phase change materials (PCMs) is a frequently occurring subject in reviews on TES. Faraj et al. [28] provided a review on PCM applications in buildings, Nair et al. [29] reviewed the use of PCMs in building-integrated heating-and-domestic-hot-water applications, Junaid et al. [30] published a review on inorganic PCMs, and Berardi and Gallardo [31] reviewed the properties of PCM-enhanced concrete structures. However, the number of reviews on energy flexibility of residential buildings using BTM storage is limited. Searching in Scopus (Spring 2023) with query set according to Table 1 , only the following five reviews were found: Chen et al. [32] provided a review on different measures for improved energy flexibility of commercial and residential buildings, using a broad approach considering both supply and demand side. Olsthoorn et al. [33] reviewed the abilities and limitations of BTM storage, focusing on means of activation, thermal performance, control and barriers. Kathirgamanathan et al. [34] published a review on data-driven predictive control for demand-side management of commercial and residential buildings. Johra and Heiselberg [35] reviewed the influence of indoor thermal mass, including PCMs in furniture, on the thermal dynamics of buildings, and Navarro et al. [36] identified and classified building-integrated thermal storage systems. To the best of the authors knowledge, there is no review exploring the storage potential in BTM of residential buildings, focusing on benefits, challenges, and influencing factors, with special attention paid to the heat emission system. 1.2 Aim of paper The aim of this review paper is to summarize research on the energy flexibility potential of residential buildings using storage in BTM, and to identify research gaps and suggest future research within the field. The review is designed to provide insights into the following questions: \u2022 What is the storage potential of BTM, and which benefits and challenges does it bring? \u2022 Which factors affect the storage potential of BTM, and how? In particular: how does the heat emission system influence? This review is limited to short-term energy storage in the BTM of residential buildings. Furthermore, it is limited to a geographic context with dominating heating (not cooling) demand. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, important background concepts such as energy flexibility of buildings, TES and BTM are defined and introduced. Section 3 introduces relevant types of heat emission systems, since the heat emission system is an influencing factor of particular interest in this paper. In Section 4, key findings from the reviewed studies on BTM storage are summarized, divided into storage potential (4.1), benefits (4.2), challenges (4.3) and influencing factors (4.4). Discussion and conclusions can be found in Section 5. 2 Energy flexibility of buildings In IEA EBC Annex 67 [37], the following definition of energy flexibility is suggested: \u201cThe Energy Flexibility of a building is the ability to manage its demand and generation according to local climate conditions, user needs, and energy network requirements. Energy Flexibility of buildings will thus allow for demand side management/load control and thereby demand response based on the requirements of the surrounding energy networks.\u201d. The concept demand-side management used in the definition above, can be defined as \u201cthe planning, implementation and monitoring of those utility activities designed to influence customer use of electricity in ways that will produce desired changes in the utility\u2019s load shape, i.e., changes in the pattern and magnitude of a utility\u2019s load\u201d [24]. The aim of demand-side management is often to balance variable electricity generation and to shift load from peak to off-peak hours [8]. Another concept mentioned in the definition above, demand response, simply means power adjustment on the demand side [6]. Energy flexibility can be applied on different levels, for instance building, district, or sector level [6]. From the energy provider\u2019s perspective, the flexibility of one single building is limited, but the aggregated flexibility of a neighbourhood or district can be considerable [10]. It has been argued that the energy flexibility should be implemented on building cluster level or district level for it to be sufficiently significant for energy providers [3,38]. Activating the energy flexibility of buildings requires control and communication between the building and the energy provider in need of flexibility. To achieve this, there are two main approaches: direct and indirect load control [2]. In case of direct load control, the provider directly controls the load of the end-user, while, in case of indirect load control, incentives are used to induce the end-user to change the load. Incentives used for indirect control are often economical in the form of variable tariff schemes [2], but also environmental incentives may be possible [39]. Regarding control at building level, three types of strategies can be identified: manual control, automated rule-based control (RBC), or advanced optimization techniques, for example model-based predictive control (MPC) [3,21]. For comparisons between different control strategies, see refs. [40\u201344]. 2.1 Quantification of energy flexibility The energy flexibility performance of buildings can be quantified in several ways, using different performance indicators focusing on different aspects of flexibility. Kensby et al. [9] suggested to use the measure degree time as a simple measurement for the TES capacity of buildings, Junker et al. [45] proposed the use of a dynamic flexibility function to characterize the flexibility of buildings and districts, and Arteconi et al. [46] introduced the flexibility performance indicator which, with a single value, weights four different aspects of the flexibility behaviour. Flexibility factor [47], flexibility index [48], thermal autonomy [49], storage capacity [12] and storage efficiency [12] are other indicators used in research. Jensen et al. [37] identified three general properties of energy flexibility: \u201ci) the time over which energy and power can be shifted or shedded; ii) the amount of energy or power that can be shifted or shedded; iii) the associated cost or efficiency loss at the building level that results from activating this flexibility.\u201d. There are different quantification methodologies that have been developed for assessment of energy flexibility. Reynders et al. [12] presented a simulation-based, dynamic quantification method for characterization of energy flexibility, and Vigna et al. [48] proposed a quantification methodology to assess the energy flexibility performance of building clusters. For reviews on quantification methodologies, see refs. [6,18,50,51]. 2.2 Thermal energy storage Using TES in buildings is one way to achieve energy flexibility. Zhang et al. [1] summarize the benefits of TES into three points: \u201c(1) reduced investment and usage of peak capacity; (2) smoother operation of equipment and reduced running cost; (3) flexible load shifting to utilize non-dispatchable variable renewable energy or electricity with lower prices\u201d. Furthermore, TES has been shown to be a low-cost alternative for electrical storage by using HPs for power-to-heat conversion [12]. TES technologies can be divided into two major categories: passive and active storage [22]. In passive storage, the driving force for charging and discharging is the temperature difference between the store and the surroundings, while in case of active storage, pumps or fans are used for charging/discharging. Heier et al. [22] divide active storage technologies into the following three groups: (1) storage in the HVAC system, (2) thermally activated building systems (TABS) and (3) storage in the direct vicinity of buildings (e.g., aquifer, borehole or buried tanks). Regarding storage in the HVAC system, different types of tanks can be used, for instance water tanks (WTs), phase change material tanks (PCMTs) and thermo-chemical material tanks (TCMTs). 2.3 Building thermal mass BTM is often classified as a passive TES technology [14,22]. Different terms are used for this TES technology; in addition to BTM, also structural thermal energy storage [12], building-inertia thermal energy storage [14] and building as battery [52] occur. In this review, BTM is consistently used. In some cases, BTM can also serve as active storage. For instance, if the thermal mass is part of a structure with embedded heating pipes, the charging of the storage is active since pumps are used. A prerequisite for successful activation of the energy flexibility of buildings using BTM is the involvement of the occupants. Since the occupants live within the BTM storage, the storage potential is hugely influenced by their acceptance for temperature variations [41]. Several studies have been carried out on occupants\u2019 attitudes towards energy flexibility in residential buildings, see refs. [4,53\u201358]. 2.4 Energy flexibility in district heating systems Energy flexibility and TES is relevant to both electric power and district heating (DH) systems. Many DH systems are characterized by a diversified mix of heat sources which differs greatly in terms of cost and environmental impact, and the peak loads are often covered by fossil fuels [14]. Therefore, it is desirable to control the heat power use in district-heated buildings towards periods during which the heat generation is favourable. The heat demand of DH systems can have considerable variations within one single day, which causes challenging conditions for efficient heat generation [9]. Gadd and Werner [59] studied 20 Swedish DH systems and found that the daily heat-load variations constituted 3\u20136 % of the annual heat supply. They claim that it would make the operation of DH systems more competitive if these variations could be eliminated. Several advantages are mentioned, such as less use of expensive peak-load power, less need for peak-load power capacity, and easier operation optimization leading to higher conversion efficiencies [59]. Several studies have shown that the use of TES in DH systems is beneficial. TES can reduce daily heat load variations [14], reduce the need of fossil fuels [60], and provide solutions for congestion management [61], resulting in more economical and environmentally sustainable systems [14,60,61]. Furthermore, the benefits of TES are expected to be even greater in the future, due to the growing need for balancing measures caused by increased generation from intermittent RESs [8]. For more benefits of TES in DH systems, see ref. [25]. There are different ways to provide DH systems with TES: the heat can be stored in BTM, in heat storage units, and in the network pipes [62]. BTM storage has been highlighted as a promising solution since heat storage units (for instance WTs) brings considerable investment costs while storing in the network pipes means impaired heat generation efficiency [14]. 3 Hydronic heat emission systems As already mentioned, one of the factors that affects the flexibility potential of buildings is the heat emission system. A commonly used heat emission system in residential buildings is hydronic radiators [15]. It is the most common system in DH connected buildings in many countries [63], and it is frequently used in Swedish residential buildings [64]. Another common heat emission system is hydronic floor heating (FH) [15]. In Germany, Austria and Denmark, 30\u201350 % of new residential buildings are provided with FH [65], and in new low-energy residentials in Finland, hydronic FH account for about 50 % of the HP-heated MFHs and 30 % of the district heated [66]. 3.1 Hydronic surface heating systems Hydronic FH is a radiant surface heat emission system. Radiant surface heat emission systems can be divided into three categories [67]: embedded surface systems, TABS and suspended radiant panels (Fig. 1 ). In embedded surface systems, the FH pipes are insulated from the main building structure, whereas, in case of TABS, the pipes are embedded in, and thermally coupled to it. Embedded surface systems and TABS are used in floor, wall and ceiling, while suspended radiant panels are mostly used in ceiling [68,69]. Several types of hydronic surface heating systems, with varying materials and position of the pipes, are described in detail in ref. [67]. Advantages and disadvantages of different heat emitters are mentioned in refs. [16,70,71], and comparisons can be found in [68,69,72\u201377]. Some heat emission systems are more suitable for retrofitting than others [78,79]. For detailed studies on TES in floor structures provided with FH, see refs. [80\u201382]. 3.2 Supply water temperature An important property of hydronic heat emission systems is the supply water temperature. The supply temperature of heat emission systems has successively decreased since the middle of the 20th century, due to decreasing heating demand of buildings [83]. Today, heat emission systems can be classified as high-, medium-, and low-temperature, with supply temperature > 55 °C for high-temperature and ≤ 45 °C for low-temperature systems. Furthermore, it has been suggested that heat emission systems with supply temperature ≤ 35 °C should be classified as very-low-temperature [83]. There are many advantages with low-temperature heating (LTH), including: \u2022 LTH enables the use of renewable and recyclable low-grade energy sources like geothermal heat, solar heat, and industrial excess heat, resulting in more exergy efficient and sustainable energy systems [26,70]. \u2022 Used with DH as heat source, LTH enables lower system temperatures in the DH network (4th Generation DH) [84], which increases the heat generation efficiency from HPs and boilers [68], reduces the heat losses and improves the equipment performance efficiency [26]. \u2022 Used with HPs as heat source, LTH significantly increases the thermal efficiency of the heat generation [83], resulting in reduced electricity use [85]. \u2022 Used together with HP and photovoltaic (PV) system, LTH brings a higher level of PV self-consumption due to improved HP efficiency [86]. \u2022 Used together with seasonal storage and solar collectors, LTH improves the energy efficiency and decreases the need of auxiliary heat source [87,88]. \u2022 LTH reduces the heat losses from heat generation units, distribution pipes, and heat emitters within buildings [85]. The opportunity to use LTH is expected to increase in future, due to a continued reduced heating demand of buildings [64,70]. Regarding DH systems, reduced supply temperatures on the demand side are of particular interest, since it is essential to lower the system temperatures to maintain the competitiveness and improve the environmental performance of future DH [64,84]. However, a limitation for reduced DH system temperatures is the preparation of legionella-safe domestic hot water [89,90]. 4 Results from reviewed studies A literature search was conducted in Scopus (spring 2023) using a query set according to Table 1. A total of 104 articles were found. Of these, some were sorted out since they were out of scope (e.g., about commercial buildings, cooling demand etc.). The remaining 42 articles were reviewed. All reviewed studies were case studies, on different levels of application: room or apartment level (19 %); building level (48 %); cluster, neighbourhood, or district level (24 %); and sector level (9 %). One study was from the US, the rest from Europe. Most studies were from Denmark (36 %), followed by Belgium (14 %), Sweden (10 %) and Italy (10 %). Almost all reviewed studies were simulation based. Regarding heat sources, 62 % of the studies use HPs and 24 % involve DH. PV systems occur in 17 % of the studies and solar collectors in 7 %. Regarding heat emission systems, hydronic radiators and FH are the most common; 36 % of the studies deals only with hydronic radiators, 17 % only with hydronic FH and 19 % with both hydronic radiators and FH. Other used heat emission systems are fan coil units, concrete core activation (CCA), forced air and electric radiators. Table 2 shows the different floor structures that are used in case of hydronic FH. The thickness of different layers and the exact position of the pipes varies. Focusing on the studies at building level, 70 % were on SFHs, 25 % on MFHs and 5 % on both SFHs and MFHs. All studies at building level are summarized in Table 3 , and used heat emission systems are presented in Fig. 2 , divided on building type. In the following sections, key findings from the reviewed studies are summarized. 4.1 Storage potential of building thermal mass This section includes findings regarding the storage capacity of BTM (4.1.1) and the load-shifting potential (4.1.2) that the storage capacity enables. The load-shifting potential is expressed in different ways, partly in terms of shifted amount of load from peak to off-peak periods, partly by using the measure thermal autonomy. Quantitative findings related to the storage potential of BTM are summarized in Table 4 . In 4.1.3, the storage potential of BTM is compared to other TES technologies. 4.1.1 Storage capacity Reynders et al. [12] studied SFHs representing the Belgian residential building stock and found that the available storage capacity of BTM was 12\u201330 kWh for radiator-heated and 16\u201366 kWh for floor-heated dwellings, assuming a comfort range of 2 °C. Yang et al. [47] investigated low-energy SFHs using storage in BTM and WT and found that the storage capacity reached 78 kWh, based on a comfort range of 6 °C. Kensby et al. [9] studied older, heavy district-heated MFHs and found that storing 100 Wh/m2 of heat would very rarely cause indoor temperature variations larger than ± 0.5 °C. Foteinaki et al. [10] evaluated the storage potential of BTM in low-energy residentials. During an 8 h flexibility event under moderate weather conditions of the Danish heating season, they found that the added/curtailed heat was 87/36 Wh/m2 for SFHs and 76/25 Wh/m2 for MFHs. 4.1.2 Load-shifting potential Storage in BTM shows great potential to shift heating loads from peak to off-peak hours. Reynders et al. [17] evaluated the demand-side management potential of HP-heated SFHs using BTM storage and found that the electricity use during peak demand periods was reduced by up to 94 %. Foteinaki et al. [2] investigated district-heated low-energy MFHs and found that the energy use during morning peak hours was reduced by 40\u201387 %. Weiß et al. [100] studied residential buildings representing the Austrian building stock and found that at least 50 % of the peak heating load from well-insulated buildings could be shifted to off-peak periods during a day in winter. They also concluded that the load-shifting potential could be improved by tolerating a larger comfort range. Pedersen et al. [99] evaluated the demand response potential of retrofitted MFHs and found that 30\u201347 % of the energy use during peak-load periods could be shifted, compared to 7 % for the unrenovated reference. Luc et al. [11] investigated the flexibility potential of a small district connected to DH and found that the energy use during mornings could be reduced by 41\u201351 %. Martirano et al. [44] studied an Italian low-energy MFH equipped with ground-source HP and PV, using common central management of heating demand and smart appliances. They found that the peak power during a day in March could be reduced by 21 % if 50 % of the end-users participated in smart appliances management. Another way to express the load-shifting potential is by using the measure thermal autonomy. The thermal autonomy can be described as the time during which the thermal comfort can be maintained with completely cut off heat supply [8]. Le Dreau and Heiselberg [13] studied SFHs with varying insulation levels and found that the thermal autonomy of poorly insulated buildings was relatively short, whereas, for well-insulated buildings, the heating system could be switched off for more than 24 h. Yang et al. [47] investigated low-energy SFHs and found that it took about 43 h for the indoor temperature to decrease from the upper (24 °C) to the lower (18 °C) comfort boundary with the heat supply turned off. Foteinaki et al. [10] studied low-energy residentials and found that SFHs maintained the indoor temperature above 20 °C for more than 48 h, while MFHs kept the same comfort range for 20 h in the coldest apartments and more than 3 days in the rest of the apartments. 4.1.3 Comparison of thermal energy storage technologies Zhang et al. [1] compared the energy performance and life-cycle cost of three different TES technologies: BTM, WT and PCMT, used in a SFH heated by ground-source HP and supplementary electric heater (EH). They found that BTM had the best economic performance due to small investment costs, while WT was less cost-effective due to high thermal losses and low storage density. They also found that the major benefit of using TES in the studied case came from reduced usage of the EH. Vanhoudt et al. [101] investigated different storage configurations used in a small-scale DH system with 100 SFHs. Three configurations were evaluated: BTM with/without distributed WTs, and a central WT. It was shown that BTM (with or without distributed WTs) was the best performing storage configurations due to a much greater amount of thermal mass, and hence also greater storage capacity. 4.2 Benefits of building thermal mass storage There are several ways to benefit from the storage potential of BTM; it can be utilized for different purposes. Stated aims that occur in the reviewed studies are summarized in Table 5 , divided on heat sources. Note that many of these aims are related to each other. The focus here is simply to provide a brief overview of what BTM storage can be used for. Below follows a detailed account for some of these benefits. 4.2.1 Cost and CO2-emission savings (electricity-heated buildings) Many studies show that BTM storage enables cost and CO2-emission savings in case of electricity-heated buildings. Masy et al. [95] evaluated HP-heated SFHs using BTM storage and found that the electricity costs were reduced for both the end-user (up to 13 %) and the electricity provider (up to 15 %) by controlling the load profile towards the electricity price. Hu et al. [16] studied well-insulated MFHs and found that the daily electricity costs were reduced by 1.8\u201318.6 %. Wei and Calautit [43] investigated dwellings at room level and found that the electricity costs were reduced by 44 % for a heavyweight room and 14 % for lightweight. Golmohamadi et al. [97] studied a HP-heated SFH using storage in BTM and WT, and found that the electricity costs during a week were reduced by up to 37 %. Askeland et al. [104] evaluated electric-heated SFHs at aggregated level using BTM and found that the system cost during January could be decreased by 13 %. Arteconi et al. [103] investigated electric-heated buildings at sector level, focusing on the impact of market penetration, and estimated that the total cost savings from reduced operational costs were \u20ac400 per participant and year for 5 % penetration rate (share of participating end-users), reduced to \u20ac200 for 100 % penetration rate. Pean et al. [42] investigated well-insulated HP-heated MFHs using storage in BTM and WT and found that the operational costs were reduced by up to 7 % and the CO2 emissions by up to 17 %, despite increased total energy use in many cases. Pedersen et al. [99] studied retrofitted MFHs using BTM and found that the costs were reduced by up to 6 % and CO2 emissions by up to 3 %, depending on the energy efficiency of the retrofit scenarios. Leerbeck et al. [93] investigated the possibilities of controlling HPs in SFHs towards minimized CO2 emissions from related electric power generation and found that the emission savings potential reached up to 17 % for well-insulated buildings but only 3 % for poorly insulated. Vigna et al. [48] studied smart operation of low-energy SFHs on cluster level and found that energy-related CO2 emissions could be reduced by up to 18 %. 4.2.2 Cost savings (district-heated buildings) It has also been shown that BTM storage brings cost savings in the context of DH. Foteinaki et al. [2] studied district-heated low-energy MFHs and found that the heat supply cost of the DH system could be reduced by up to 15 % during a heating season. Dominkovic et al. [8] investigated district-heated SFHs and found that the economic savings in operational costs of the DH system were 0.7\u20134.6 %, neglecting the cost of control equipment. Luc et al. [11] studied a small district connected to DH and found that the total costs were reduced by 0.8\u20132.5 % for control scenarios with pre-heating and 9.0 % without pre-heating. Vanhoudt et al. [101] evaluated the economic benefits of active control of a gas-fired combined heat and power plant used as heat source for a small-scale DH system. They found that the profit of the plant increased drastically by the use of active control, due to greater revenue from electric power generation. 4.2.3 Integration of renewable energy sources Storage in BTM also enables increased use of RESs. Vigna et al. [48] studied smart operation of Italian building clusters of SFHs equipped with large-scale HP and PV and found that the use of BTM brought increased renewable energy usage; the annual residual heating demand was reduced by up to 13 %. Fernandez Bandera et al. [107] investigated a Spanish flat equipped with HP and PV and found that the PV use increased with 35\u201349 % in winter and 72\u2013110 % in summer. Martirano et al. [44] evaluated an Italian low-energy MFH with ground-source HP and PV and found that the self-consumption ratio during a day in March could be increased from 90 % to 100 % by controlling the heating demand and smart appliances. Dominkovic et al. [8] studied Danish district-heated SFHs and found that the use of BTM made it possible to utilize more solar heating in the DH system. It has also been found that the economic benefits of storage in BTM increases with increased RES penetration. Arteconi et al. [103] studied HP-heated dwellings of the Belgian building stock and found that the more the generation is based on RESs, the higher economic benefits can be achieved by implementing active demand response. Mascherbauer et al. [102] investigated HP-heated SFHs of the Austrian building stock and found that the incentive for load shifting increased with higher ambition level for decarbonation, due to higher electricity prices. Additionally, Dominkovic et al. [8] evaluated district-heated SFHs and found that the benefits of BTM storage will be much greater in the future energy system since it enables more intermittent heat generation in the DH supply. 4.2.4 Reduced primary energy demand Storage in BTM can also bring reduced primary energy demand. Arnaudo et al. [111] studied district-heated MFHs on urban district level with heat supply from cogeneration plants and peak boilers. By utilizing storage in BTM, they found that the primary energy demand of the peak boilers could be reduced by up to 70 %. Wolisz et al. [41] investigated the potential for improved energy efficiency of SFHs using BTM. For well-insulated buildings, they found that the primary energy efficiency was clearly improved, while, for low-insulated buildings, only very small improvements were achieved. 4.3 Challenges of building thermal mass storage The use of storage in BTM also brings some challenges. 4.3.1 New peaks in heat demand The use of BTM for load shifting can cause new undesired peak loads. Marszal-Pomianowska et al. [91] investigated how local electricity networks are influenced by the energy flexibility of buildings controlled by price signals. They found that the performance of the electricity network was improved due to decreased afternoon peaks. However, since the price signal was uniform for all customers, the shifting of loads created new problematic peak loads at night. They suggested that a more uniform load profile could be achieved by adding a coordination mechanism to the control algorithm, by which the price signal between customers could be differentiated. Hedegaard et al. [110] investigated an existing neighbourhood of district-heated SFHs with the objective to lower the morning peak heat demand. It was found that the indirect price-based demand response scheme that was used as incentive was inappropriate for this purpose, since it caused new and larger peaks. To prevent this, some constraints were added to the scheme, resulting in somewhat reduced peak demand, but also reduced load-shifting efficiency. Luc et al. [11] studied the flexibility potential of a small district connected to DH and found that the peak heat demand increased by 35\u201349 %. However, it was also showed that this increased peak demand could be mitigated by distributing the setpoint increase in different buildings. 4.3.2 Interaction between supply and demand side Another challenge with BTM storage is that the implementation of load shifting at large scale affects the electricity price. Mascherbauer et al. [102] investigated the demand-side management potential of HP-heated SFHs managed towards variable electricity prices and found that considerable amounts of electricity demand could be shifted through storage in BTM. However, a limitation of this study was that the impact of load shifting on the electricity prices was neglected. They claim that a large penetration of load-shifting buildings could lead to a \u201cself-cannibalism effect\u201d, i.e., impaired economic benefits due to changing electricity prices caused by changing load pattern. But creating integrated simulation models, considering the interaction between supply and demand side, is challenging. Patteeuw et al. [106] developed such an integrated modelling approach that captured the full impact of active demand response on both supply and demand side. However, this advanced model also entailed significant computational costs. They found that models using a fixed electricity price profile, thus neglecting the interaction between supply and demand side, can be misleading. 4.3.3 Increasing total energy use Load shifting reduces the peak loads, but often at the expense of greater total energy use due to the deviation from optimal operation of the heating system. Masy et al. [95] evaluated the flexibility potential of HP-heated SFHs and found that the electricity use increased by up to 20 % by controlling the load profile towards electricity pricing. Weiß et al. [100] investigated residentials of the Austrian building stock and found that the final energy use increased by 2\u20135 % in most cases. Foteinaki et al. [2] studied district-heated low-energy MFHs and found that the total energy use during a heating season increased by up to 2 % in some control scenarios. Luc et al. [11] investigated a small district connected to DH and found that the total energy use increased by 2\u20134 % in the control scenarios using pre-heating. However, increased energy use may be considered acceptable if the economic or environmental benefits, on building or system level, outweigh [2,17]. Heinen et al. [105] carried out a planning analysis of a future Irish energy system using BTM of HP-heated SFHs and found that the increased heat demand resulting from flexible operation were negligible compared to the huge cost savings that were related to benefits on system level. 4.4 Influencing factors of building thermal mass storage The storage potential of BTM is influenced by several factors, not least the insulation level of the building envelope, the available amount of thermal mass, the heat emission system, used control strategies and the boundary conditions. Below follows an account of how these factors influence. 4.4.1 Impact from envelope insulation level The insulation level of the building envelope influences the storage potential of BTM in different ways, and both poorly insulated and well-insulated buildings have their advantages and disadvantages. Le Dreau and Heiselberg [13] studied SFHs with varying insulation level and found, for poorly insulated buildings, that large amount of heat could be shifted for short periods of time, whereas, for well-insulated buildings, the shiftable amount of heat was smaller but the periods of time longer. Reynders et al. [12] found that increasing insulation level resulted in increased storage efficiency but decreased storage capacity. There are studies indicating that high insulation level is favourable from a flexibility point of view. Dominkovic et al. [8] studied SFHs of the Danish building stock and found that the highest flexibility potential was provided by newer houses, characterized by low transmission losses. Masy et al. [95] found that the load-shifting potential of Belgian SFHs increased with increasing insulation level, provided that there is enough accessible thermal mass in the building. Oliveira Panao [52] et al. investigated heavy Portuguese MFHs and found that the insulation level was the key driver of storage efficiency; the storage efficiency reached 60\u201380 % in highly insulated apartments but only 40\u201370 % in low-insulated. Askeland et al. [104] studied Norwegian SFHs on aggregated level and found that well-insulated buildings were loaded more often than less-insulated, due to their lower storage losses. However, there are also limitations of well-insulated buildings. As already mentioned, the storage capacity is smaller in well-insulated buildings [12], and Zhang et al. [1] found that the charging and discharging power when storing in well-insulated buildings was limited, resulting in less cost savings compared to poorly insulated buildings. Furthermore, Johra et al. [5] point out that the heating season is shorter for well-insulated buildings, compared to less-insulated, which means that the flexibility is available during a smaller part of the year. They also mention that well-insulated buildings are at higher risk of overheating when activating thermal storage in the indoor space. Even though well-insulated buildings have some advantages, it should be noted that also poorly insulated buildings can be useful for flexibility purposes. Johra et al. [5] claim that poorly insulated buildings can have larger individual impact on the energy system than well-insulated buildings, due to their ability to shift larger amount of heat. 4.4.2 Impact from heat emission system The heat emission system affects the storage potential of BTM. Hydronic FH is beneficial compared to radiators since the FH pipes directly activates the thermal mass of the floor structure with smaller impact on the indoor air temperature, whereas radiators mainly heat through the indoor air, resulting in faster air temperature changes [5,12,17]. The quick activation of the indoor air in case of radiators increases the ventilation and infiltration heat losses and restricts the heat storage in the building structures [5]. Reynders et al. [12] studied SFHs of the Belgian building stock using storage in BTM and found that floor-heated buildings showed higher storage efficiencies and storage capacities compared to radiators (see Fig. 3 ). In another study, Reynders et al. [17] investigated HP-heated SFHs and found that the electricity use during peak demand periods was reduced by up to 94 % in case of FH, compared to 75 % in case of radiators. Johra et al. [5] studied SFHs and found that the use of FH improved the flexibility performance by up to 44 % (low-insulation dwellings) and 8 % (high-insulation dwellings) compared to radiators. Leerbeck et al. [93] evaluated the environmental benefits of controlling HPs in SFHs and found that the CO2-emission savings for well-insulated buildings reached 9\u201317 % in case of FH and 10\u201312 % in case of radiators, depending on the thickness of the concrete slab. Arteconi et al. [94] investigated the load-shifting potential of HP-heated SFHs by switching of the HP during peak hours. In case of FH, they found that the thermal comfort could be maintained without any additional heat storage, whereas, in case of radiators, a storage unit was required. 4.4.3 Impact from thermal mass The storage potential of BTM increases with the amount of thermal mass in the building. Johra et al. [5] investigated how indoor content (like furniture) influence the flexibility performance using an empty building as reference. They found that the presence of furniture and items inside light-weight dwellings could increase the flexibility potential by 21 % for low-insulated and 10 % for well-insulated envelopes. Weiß et al. [100] studied dwellings at room level and found that increased amount of BTM mitigated the indoor air temperature changes, resulting in a 20\u201330 % higher load-shifting potential on average. Furthermore, Reynders et al. [17] found that the potential for demand-side management was higher for heavy buildings compared to light-weight, Arteconi et al. [46] found that the thermal mass of the building envelope was important for the flexibility performance, and Feldhofer and Healy [98] found that increased amount of thermal mass in outer walls enabled larger variations in setpoint indoor air temperature with maintained level of thermal comfort. Wei and Calautit [43] investigated how the storage performance was influenced by the thermal mass of the envelope and found that the heating system was running in average 15.7 h daily in the case of a lightweight room, compared to 4.5 h for a heavyweight. However, the impact from thermal mass depends on where the mass is located and its interaction with the heat emission system. Foteinaki et al. [10] studied low-energy dwellings with external and internal walls made of concrete. They found that the internal walls contributed more to the flexibility than the external walls, since the internal walls are exposed to the indoor air on two sides. They also found that the concrete thickness of the external walls had no significant influence on the flexibility performance. Johra et al. [92] investigated floor-heated SFHs with varying thermal mass of the building structures. They found that the thermal mass of the concrete slab (with embedded FH pipes) entailed great benefits compared to a light-weight floor structure of wood. Furthermore, they found that the impact of additional thermal mass of walls and ceilings was limited since these structures were not directly activated by the heat emission system. 4.4.4 Impact from control strategies The storage potential of BTM is also influenced by which control strategy that is used. RBC and MPC are two frequently used control strategies in the reviewed studies, where RBC is a simpler strategy and MPC a more advanced. Le Dreau et al. [13] suggested that simple control strategies should not be used in well-insulated buildings due to the risk of overheating. Some studies have shown the benefits of MPC strategies compared to RBC: Hu et al. [16] found that MPC could help improving the thermal comfort in well-insulated MFHs, and Wolisz et al. [41] found that self-learning MPC resulted in decreased primary energy demand by up to 7 % compared to RBC. 4.4.5 Impact from climate conditions Finally, the storage potential of BTM depends on ambient climate conditions. Foteinaki et al. [10] found that the flexibility potential of Danish low-energy residentials was strongly dependent on the ambient air temperature and solar radiation. The possibility for storing energy was highest during days with moderate ambient air temperature, while cold days were beneficial for energy curtailment. They also found that increased solar gains impaired the flexibility performance. Arteconi et al. [46] investigated Italian dwellings and found that external weather conditions had great impact; the flexibility performance was deteriorated in cold winter and hot summer periods. 4.4.6 Comparison between the influencing factors Johra et al. [5] investigated how different building parameters affect the load-shifting potential of SFHs using BTM, and found that the envelope insulation level was the parameter with greatest influence, more significant than the amount of thermal mass and the type of heat emission system. Additionally, Foteinaki et al. [10] found, based on studies on low-energy residentials, that the flexibility potential is govern by the heat losses. The insulation level is a significant parameter also when it comes to thermal autonomy. Dominkovic et al. [8] studied Danish SFHs and found that the total heat loss coefficient of the building envelope had larger impact on the thermal autonomy than the amount of thermal mass. 5 Discussion and conclusions In this review, an overview of studies on energy flexibility of residential buildings using storage in building thermal mass (BTM) was provided. It was found that BTM storage show great potential to shift heating loads in the short term, from peak hours to off-peak hours. This load-shifting potential can be utilized for different purposes, for instance reduced costs for end-users or energy providers, reduced primary energy demand, reduced CO2 emissions, or increased renewable-energy-source penetration. The load-shifting potential also brings challenges, not least the risk of creating new, larger, peaks if implemented at large scale. Regarding cost savings for end-users due to BTM storage, it can be noted that the economic benefits increase with increased energy price fluctuations [47,102]. For electricity-heated buildings, several studies show significant cost savings, with reduced electricity costs by up to 44 % (see 4.2.1). Many of these studies (for instance [16,43,97]) utilise dynamic electricity prices characterized by great fluctuations. Regarding district-heated buildings, only few studies [40,47] focus on end-user costs; more often, it is the heat demand during peak periods or heat supply cost of the DH system that is evaluated (see Table 5). In one of these studies [47], dynamic hourly heat prices of a future DH system with small price fluctuations were applied, resulting in cost savings of around 15 % (utilizing storage in both BTM and WT). At present, however, there is an important difference between electricity-heated and district-heated buildings when it comes to economic incentives for load shifting. Electric power can be bought at hourly, time-varying prices, whereas DH heat prices often are constant over seasons [47,112], short-term time-varying heat prices are typically not available [2]. To unlock the full load-shifting potential of district-heated buildings, the economic incentives need to be strengthened by adapted heat price models. The envelope insulation level is the factor with largest impact on the storage potential of BTM; increased insulation level brings advantages such as improved storage efficiency and prolonged thermal autonomy due to smaller heat losses, but also some disadvantages such as decreased storage capacity, increased risk of overheating, and shorter heating season during which the storage potential is available. However, even if well-insulated building envelopes, from a flexibility point of view, bring some disadvantages in addition to the advantages, one should remember that well-insulated building envelopes are favourable in many respects; it brings reduced energy demands for heating, resulting in reduced associated energy costs and CO2 emissions. Another important influencing factor is the heat emission system. Hydronic floor heating is beneficial compared to radiators, both in terms of storage capacity and storage efficiency, since it directly can activate the thermal mass of the floor structure and has smaller direct impact on the indoor temperature. The following research gaps are identified: \u2022 Studies on energy flexibility of multi-family houses (MFHs) equipped with hydronic floor heating are few; among the reviewed studies at building level, only 30 % deals with MFHs, and only one with floor-heated MFHs (see Fig. 2). Regarding the three categories for surface heating systems (Fig. 1), the embedded surface system (with the pipes insulated from the main building structure) is the most common type for intermediate floors in MFHs; thermally activated building systems (TABS) do not occur at all. There is one study [100] on MFHs using concrete core activation, but the floor/ceiling structure used in this case is not described in detail. Therefore, more studies should be conducted on the flexibility potential of MFHs using TABS. Since this review clearly has shown that heat emission systems with large thermal inertia is favourable when it comes to flexibility, something that is also confirmed by other studies [113,114], TABS is probably a promising solution for thermal energy storage. \u2022 Since economic incentives for load-shifting are weaker in the case of district-heated buildings compared to electricity-heated, it may affect the overall competitiveness of DH negatively, compared to electric-driven heat pumps. This is an interesting area for future research. \u2022 A relatively small share of the reviewed studies (24 %) is applied to cluster, neighbourhood, or district level, compared to room, apartment or building level (67 %). The interaction between different buildings applying demand response, and the aggregated flexibility potential of several buildings needs more investigation. In this area, new possibilities are emerging. The flexibility potential from several buildings can be gathered through third-party intermediaries (called aggregators), and clusters of buildings can share and exchange energy in local energy communities. \u2022 Studies at building level using multiple heat sources (so called multicarrier systems) are lacking, for instance combined DH and heat pumps. Multicarrier systems are promising due to their inherently flexible nature [3]; by switching between fuels, it becomes possible to respond to the needs of energy providers and still maintain the same level of service to end-users.

        "dc:description": "The transition to a more sustainable energy system with a growing amount of intermittent renewable energy sources brings an increasing need for flexibility measures to maintain balance between supply and demand. Buildings represent a promising source of demand-side flexibility due to their large energy demand and thermal mass. This review provides insights into the storage potential of building thermal mass, and the benefits and challenges it brings. It is found that building thermal mass storage have good ability to shift loads on short term, from peak to off-peak hours. This ability can be utilized for different purposes, for instance reduced costs for end-users or energy providers, reduced primary energy demand, or reduced CO2 emissions. Furthermore, this review explores different factors that influence the storage potential of building thermal mass, with special attention paid to the heat emission system. It is shown that hydronic floor heating is beneficial compared to radiators since it directly can activate the thermal mass with smaller impact on the indoor temperature. It is also found that the factor with largest impact is the envelope insulation level; increased insulation level brings improved storage efficiency and prolonged thermal autonomy but also decreased storage capacity and increased risk of overheating. Finally, research gaps are identified.",
