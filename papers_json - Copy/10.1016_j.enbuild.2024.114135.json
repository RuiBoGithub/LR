This paper proposes a transfer learning (TL)-based control-oriented model development framework. In particular, this study examines the transferability from virtual (source) to existing (target) buildings to overcome the data imbalance issue of the data-driven approach. The target system is a cooling system comprising two supply air fans and four condensing units. First, synthetic data rich enough to provide fundamental knowledge about the target system were generated using the EnergyPlus model. A data-driven model was subsequently developed to learn the underlying dynamics of the system. By adopting TL using an imbalanced dataset measured from the target system, the knowledge that the model learned from the virtual data was transferred to the target system of the existing building. The results showed that the transfer learning model could accurately describe the dynamic behavior of the target system and predict the supply air temperature with marginal errors (CVRMSE: 5.4%, MAE: 0.96 ℃). In other words, the TL from virtual to existing buildings can overcome the data imbalance issue for developing a reliable data-driven model.

Therefore, identifying and evaluating energy-saving technologies and strategies during this phase is critical [7]. The Model Predictive Control (MPC) of building heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems is an advanced optimal control scheme capable of orchestrating different system dynamics and disturbances while simultaneously improving the indoor environment and energy consumption. However, few actual implementation cases are spotted, which can be attributed to labor-intensive modeling that requires in-depth expertise. Reducing the modeling effort while enhancing the model reliability remains an important problem. Two main approaches exist for developing control-oriented models: physics-based and data-driven. Physics-based models calculate output variables using input variables based on first-principles equations which describe the thermal dynamics and energy behavior of buildings [25]. The physics models show good generalization performance owing to their robust first-principles-based equations [2]. However, they require detailed information on the input variables and parameters, which are difficult to obtain in practice. A lack of detailed information can degrade the accuracy of the physics model. By contrast, data-driven models do not require an understanding of building physics because they statistically describe the dynamics of systems by fitting the functions of the inputs and outputs [2]. Data-driven models include relatively few variables to be measured. Hence, these models are more suitable for field implementation. Although many studies have demonstrated the adaptability of data-driven models, the implementation of data-driven MPC in existing buildings presents significant challenges. One of the major challenges is the data imbalance problem. To correctly identify the dynamics of building systems, models should be built with sufficient training data that covers the entire spectrum of inputs. However, when building a system model, an input coverage problem is always encountered. Building systems are usually operated in a monotonous manner, such as at a fixed set-point temperature, fixed water flow rate, or fixed fan flow rate. Hence, most data gathered under the monotonous operations are inherently incomplete, which can lead to a poor identification of system dynamics [14]. For example, suppose that a building\u2019s central HVAC system is set to maintain a constant temperature of 22 °C in the winter season. This control streamlines daily operational actions, but greatly reduces the variety of data collected, thus impeding the development of models capable of fully exploiting the system's potential. To fully utilize the capabilities of HVAC systems for optimal control, it is essential to apply datasets that cover the entire range of operational conditions and scenarios. In other words, although data availability over the building lifecycle has increased, the data available from the monotonous operations are not rich enough for learning robust data-driven models. Previous studies have argued that additional excitation is required to address the data imbalance problem [13,11,9]. For example, Kusiak et al. [13] developed multilayer perceptron (MLP) models to predict the indoor temperature of conditioned zones and the energy consumption of a variable air volume (VAV) HVAC system. Operational data with a randomly adjusted VAV setpoint were generated to develop the MLP models. Killian and Kozek [11] developed local linear model trees for the heating dynamics of a university building equipped with a thermal-activated building system and fan coils. The model data were obtained from open-loop tests conducted during holidays and weekends. Joe et al. [9] developed a data-driven model for a radiant floor-heating system to predict air and surface temperatures using data generated by excitations. Although the aforementioned studies have designed excitations for data generation, it is argued that the excitation signals are hardly applicable to existing buildings because they are usually incompatible with normal operations [22]. Therefore, the experiments were usually conducted partially within the comfort range or during unoccupied periods to avoid thermal discomfort to the occupants; in other words, for existing buildings, it is practically difficult to collect data that is rich enough through experiments. Recent studies [19,23,6,26] have addressed the data imbalance problem by incorporating advanced data science techniques. For instance, Tian et al. [19] introduced a two-phase parameter identification approach for developing a model that can predict ultra-short-term air conditioning loads. This method enables the model to capture the dynamics of both frequently and infrequently occurring operation conditions. Zhang et al. [23] explored solutions to the skewed data distribution in building energy load predictions. Their solution involved a multi-model strategy that creates distinct models for each operational condition, employing an ensemble of these models for load prediction across various scenarios. In the area of fault diagnosis and detection (FDD), Fan et al. [6] and Zhou et al. [26] used the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) to mitigate the data imbalance. According to Zhou et al. [26], SMOTE can significantly enhance the data-driven FDD models' capability to identify HVAC fault conditions. Nonetheless, these studies have a common limitation that their models are not capable of adapting to any conditions not represented in the training data. This limitation highlights a critical challenge in our field: to develop fully-generalized models that can cover new or unseen scenarios, especially in existing buildings where operational constraints restrict the collection of diverse and comprehensive data. In contrast to previous studies, this study proposes a transfer learning-based data-driven model development method to address the data imbalance issue. Transfer learning (TL) is a machine learning method that reuses a data-driven model trained for one task (source) for other related tasks (target). The purpose of TL is to improve the performance in a target task by leveraging the knowledge learned from the original task when the data are insufficient, as in the case of buildings [12]. In other words, TL can reduce the data dependency of a data-driven approach. The TL for building models can be applied using two approaches: existing-to-existing and virtual-to-existing. The first approach uses knowledge learned from rich data on other existing buildings for target buildings. However, this method cannot be applied when the data from other buildings are inaccessible. In this regard, this study proposes a TL from virtual to existing buildings. A prerequisite for TL applications is a degree of similarity between source and target tasks [16]. With virtual buildings, it is relatively easy to create buildings with similar systems that contain fundamental dynamics similar to the target tasks. In addition, virtual experiments can be conducted to generate data rich enough for high-fidelity data-driven models. Therefore, in this study, we intend to overcome the data imbalance issue for a data-driven model by applying the TL from virtual buildings to existing buildings. For this purpose, a data-driven model was developed in three phases. (1) A synthetic dataset was generated using the EnergyPlus model equipped with a system similar to that of a target building. (2) A data-driven model was pretrained using the synthetic data to learn the fundamental dynamics of the system. (3) Finally, the pretrained model was fine-tuned on imbalanced real data to transfer knowledge. Fig. 1 elucidates the hypothesis of this study. Compared to conventional ML and conventional TL (existing-to-existing), the proposed TL approach (virtual-to-existing) can be more data-efficient because it can transfer physical knowledge acquired from virtual buildings. In addition, the proposed approach can increase a model\u2019s extrapolation ability beyond the measured data because it takes an advantage of virtual physics-based models. This will be substantiated in the following sections. In addition, please note that this paper reports a follow-up further study of Ra et al. [17] where a purely data-driven MPC for a real-life building has been addressed. In contrast, this paper focuses on improving the model development method introduced in Ra et al. [17]. 2 Transfer learning and hybrid machine learning model 2.1 Transfer learning The data imbalance problem is a major challenge in the development of data-driven models for real-life cases. To address this, transfer learning (TL) has been introduced and applied in many fields such as image classification and natural language processing. TL is the improvement of learning in the \u2018target\u2019 domain through the transfer of knowledge from the \u2018source\u2019 domain that has already been learned [15]. Fig. 2 shows the major differences between conventional machine learning and TL. TL can use one model for various tasks via knowledge transfer, whereas the conventional approach requires a separate model for each task. Fine tuning is a popular approach for implementing transfer learning. Fig. 3 shows a major fine-tuning approach for neural networks. Using a source dataset that is sufficient and diverse, a network is pretrained for the source task. Typically, for fine-tuning, the earlier layers of the pretrained network are frozen and the later layers are retrained using the target data; this is because the earlier layers contain more generally applicable information for various tasks, whereas the later layers contain more specific information [21]. The number of frozen layers depends on the size of the target dataset and the similarity between the source and target tasks. Three common benefits of TL are depicted in Fig. 4 [16]: jump start (higher initial performance), time to threshold (faster training), and asymptotic performance (higher final performance). \u2018Jump start\u2019 describes the higher initial performance in the target task using the transferred knowledge; it also requires a shorter \u2018time to threshold\u2019 performance in the target task given the transferred knowledge. A higher \u2018asymptotic performance\u2019 level is achievable compared with learning from scratch [16]. Recently, transfer learning has attracted considerable attention in indoor environmental control systems. Several studies [20,24], (Lissa et al., 2021) have examined the transferability of data-driven models from virtual buildings (source) to virtual buildings (target), and the results have shown that applying TL can enhance performance in terms of energy savings and training speed. Chen et al. [5] presented the advantages of applying TL to develop data-driven models for predicting the indoor temperature and relative humidity. The model was pretrained and fine-tuned to transfer knowledge regarding building dynamics between two cities with different weather conditions, Beijing and Shanghai. Jiang and Lee [8] applied transfer learning to develop long short-term memory networks for predicting the thermal dynamics of commercial buildings. They used four publicly available measured datasets to demonstrate the applicability of the TL to thermal building models. Kazmi et al. [10] applied TL to develop an energy-prediction model for residential hot water systems in the Netherlands. However, as discussed in Section 1, it is difficult to obtain sufficiently diverse source data to acquire the knowledge corresponding to the target task. In other words, knowledge transfer from one existing building to another is possible under extremely favorable conditions. From this perspective, this study proposes a TL framework from virtual to existing buildings, particularly for HVAC models. By adopting virtual buildings as source tasks, the proposed framework can overcome the aforementioned data imbalance problem of the data-driven approach. 2.2 Hybrid machine learning model A hybrid machine learning (ML) model was adopted in this study to take the best use of both physics-based and data-driven approaches. A data-driven approach, or black-box model is advantageous because it does not require in-depth expertise and detailed knowledge of building physics but statistically captures the features between the inputs and outputs established using a training dataset. However, the black-box model lacks an extrapolation ability because it is difficult to attribute physical meaning to model parameters [4,1]. To overcome the aforementioned drawbacks of data-driven models, Ahn et al. [3] introduced a hybrid ML model where physics model was introduced as the output layer to augment the ML model as depicted in Fig. 5 . The data-driven model estimates x ^ that is rarely collected from the target systems, and the estimations are used by the physics model to calculate the final output ( Y ^ ). The weights of the data-driven model are updated based on the error between the measured outputs (Y) and calculated outputs ( Y ^ ). The hybrid ML model allows the computation of the physics model, which enhances the interpretability of the results even with unknown variables, whereas the pure physics model requires all variables to be measured. In addition, by introducing the physical causality, the hybrid ML model is more effective in avoiding overfitting and shows better generalization performance than pure data-driven models. In this study, the hybrid ML modeling approach was adopted to predict SAT of the target cooling system, which will be addressed in the following sections. 3 Target system The target system is a cooling system of a heavy machinery engine manufacturing building located in Incheon, South Korea (Fig. 6 (a), [17]. The cooling system comprises a single direct-expansion-type cooling coil (DXC), four condensing units (CDUs, cooling capacity: 210 kW × 4EA, power: 54.5 kW × 4EA, COP: 3.9), and two supply fans (airflow rate: 40,000 m3/h × 2EA, power: 30 kW × 2EA)). (Fig. 6(b)\u2013(c)). The supply air branches into rectangular ducts (Fig. 6(d)). Notably, the supply air is 100 % outdoor air because the room is an engine manufacturing space with significant odors and dirt. Fig. 7 shows the physical configuration of the target cooling system. The outdoor air is chilled by passing it through a DX-type cooling coil connected to the four CDUs. These CDUs can be turned on and off individually; in other words, the amount of heat removal in the zone depends on the number of operating CDUs and the outdoor air states. Therefore, identifying the dynamic behavior of the CDU operations is crucial for MPC implementation. Five types of information were gathered from the sensors installed in the target building: outdoor air temperature (OAT, T1), outdoor air relative humidity (OARH, H1), supply air temperature (SAT, T2), operating status of the CDUs (O1-O4), and operating status of the fans (O5-O6) (Fig. 7). Normal operation data were gathered for 23 days in the summer (Jul 19\u2013Aug 13). Fig. 8 illustrates an example of the data imbalance problem of the target system. The prevailing operational pattern indicates that the system operator typically turns the four CDUs on and off simultaneously without considering the cooling load of the zone. The existing manual control leads to inefficient energy use (Ra et. al, 2023) but also produces a dataset that is not exciting enough, that is, the data does not cover the different operating scenarios. We should not expect to develop a robust data-driven model that captures the underlying physics of a target system from an incomplete dataset as data-driven approaches typically lack generalization guarantees outside the data on which they are trained [18]. In other words, such data imbalance issue should be addressed to develop a high-fidelity data-driven model and facilitate the field implementation of MPC. 4 Development of hybrid prediction model via transfer learning Fig. 9 elucidates the three phases of developing transfer learning model of the target cooling system. In phase Ⅰ, a synthetic dataset (D1) is generated using an EnergyPlus model which is equipped with an outdoor air intake and four CDUs representative of the target system. D1 covers various control scenarios that are unavailable from the normal operational data (D2) of the target system. More details regarding Phase I are explained in Section 4.1. In phase II, a synthetic data model pretrained with D1was developed to predict SAT, which is addressed in Section 4.2. In phase III, the pretrained synthetic data model is fine-tuned using the imbalanced dataset (D2) gathered during the building operation periods (Section 4.3). Please note that D2 are imbalanced in terms of the operating CDUs as shown in Fig. 8. As a final stage, the fine-tuned model, transfer learning model was validated on the full dataset (D3), which contains the full control options of the target system (the number of operating CDUs: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4) (Section 5). 4.1 Generating synthetic data (D1) through co-simulation of EnergyPlus model An EnergyPlus model was developed to generate a synthetic dataset (D1) (Fig. 10 ). The virtual building was modeled with a shoebox shape with dimensions of 80 × 60 m, the same size as the zone served by the target system [17]. Please note that as shown in Fig. 10(b), a DOAS with four coils was used instead of four CDUs. This is because for the EnergyPlus simulation model, it is impossible to connect four condensing units to one cooling coil. The zone was cooled using 100 % outdoor air intake with four cooling coils representing the target system. The capacity of each cooling coil was modeled to be equal to the nominal specifications of the CDU (cooling capacity: 210 kW × 4EA, power: 54.5 kW × 4EA, COP: 3.9). Notably, the default values for the design variables, such as the wall U-value, window U-value, and SHGC, were used for the simulations. This is because the virtual building was aimed at providing general knowledge about the target system by covering various operational scenarios, rather than exactly duplicating the target building and system. Using the simulation model, various control scenarios that are difficult to test in existing buildings due to workers' thermal satisfaction and system stability constraints could be applied. The synthetic dataset (D1) was generated via co-simulation with Python through a building control virtual test bed (BCVTB). The number of operating CDUs (0\u20134) was changed randomly every three hours and the co-simulation spanned four months during the summer season (June\u2013September; Fig. 11 ). D1 was sampled at intervals of 10 min (17,568 data points). Please note that the D1 was a balanced dataset from the perspective of control scenarios (Fig. 11 (c)). In other words, a synthetic dataset (D1), which is sufficiently diverse for a robust prediction model, could be generated through virtual experiments. 4.2 Synthetic data model pretrained with synthetic dataset (D1) A hybrid ML model, or synthetic data model was developed to predict SAT of the target cooling system from the outdoor air states and control scenarios using the synthetic dataset (D1) (Fig. 12 ). The physical causality between the inputs and outputs was augmented in the hybrid ML model by introducing Eqs. (1)\u2013(4). The heat removal (Qprovided ) by the cooling system can be calculated as the product of the cooling coil capacity (Qcoil = 210 kW) and number of operating coils (Ncoil ) (Eq. (1)). In addition, the amount of heat removal (Qair ) can be obtained by multiplying the temperature difference between OAT and SAT by the heat capacity of the air (Capair [W/℃]) (Eq. (2)). The heat exchange efficiency ( ε ) of the system can be calculated as the ratio of Qair and Qprovided (Eq. (3)). Finally, the SAT is calculated as a function of OAT, Ncoil , and ε . However, ε is hard to measure; therefore, an artificial neural network (ANN) was trained to estimate the uncertain value ε using the inputs. Please note that we have the limited number of measured data as shown in Fig. 12 (x1-x8, SAT). Thus, it was difficult to validate the estimated parameter, ε . However, this can be substantiated by the model validation which will be discussed in Section 5. In addition, more informative input such as power consumption of CDUs was not used in the ANN model because it was not measured. Keras, a deep-learning library, was used to develop the data-driven part of the model. The weights of the ANN were updated based on the error between the calculated SAT ( SAT ^ ) and the measured SAT. The following ANN hyperparameters were determined in a trial and error manner. \u2022 Number of hidden layers: 5 \u2022 Number of nodes at each hidden layer: 30 \u2022 Epoch: 300 \u2022 Optimizer: Adam (Adaptive moment estimation) \u2022 Activation function: ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) (1) Q provided = Q coil ∙ N coil (2) Q air = Cap air ∙ ( O A T - S A T ) (3) ε = Q air / Q provided (4) SAT = O A T - ε ∙ Cap coil Cap air ∙ N coil 4.3 Transfer learning model by fine-tuning the synthetic data model with measured imbalanced dataset (D2) By adopting transfer learning, the pretrained hybrid ML model was fine-tuned for use in the target system. For fine-tuning, a strategy of retraining the later layers of the ANN model and freezing the earlier layers was applied. This strategy could be adopted when the target dataset is similar to the source domain dataset but not sufficiently large to train a model from scratch (Gao et al. 2020). More layers can be frozen when more data or more similar tasks are available. In this study, only the last layer was retrained using D2 to adapt the model to the target system. Retraining was conducted for 30 epochs at a learning rate of 0.005. D2 was gathered for 26 days (Jul 19 \u2013 Aug 13) from the target building at intervals of 10 min (3,744 points) (Fig. 13 ). As illustrated in Fig. 8 and Fig. 13(a), all four CDUs were operating at the same time and thus, D2 does not contain sufficient information in terms of the number of operating CDUs. After fine-tuning using the measured imbalanced dataset (D2), the model was evaluated on the full dataset (D3) containing all possible control scenarios (number of operating CDUs: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4). D3 was gathered from in-situ experiments spanned for 12 days (Sep 2 \u2013 Sep 13) at the intervals of 10 min (1,728 points, Fig. 14 ). In other words, Fig. 11(a) shows the random operation, while Fig. 13(a) shows the gathered data from the in-situ operation. The detailed description of the data gathering of D3 are explained in Ra et al. [17]. Please note that the supply air temperature in Fig. 13 (b) is significantly lower than that in Fig. 12 (b) because the target system uses 100 % outdoor air for supply air. Also, please note that D3 was not used for developing the transfer learning model, but for validation only. The prediction accuracy of the transfer learning model was evaluated with the coefficient of variation of root mean square error (CVRMSE) and MAE (mean absolute error). These were computed as follows: (5) RMSE = 1 N ∑ i = 1 N ( y i ^ - y i ) 2 (6) CVRMSE = RMSE y ¯ × 100 [ % ] (7) MAE = 1 N ∑ i = 1 N y i ^ - y i where N is the number of data points, y is the measured value, y ^ is the predicted value, and y ¯ is the average of measured value. 5 Results 5.1 Synthetic data model As mentioned in Section 4.1 and 4.2, the synthetic data model was trained using the synthetic dataset (D1) generated from the EnergyPlus model. D1 was split in a ratio of 7:3 to train and test the model. Fig. 15 presents the results of the synthetic data model. The model could predict SAT with high accuracy (CVRMSE: 8.11 %, MAE: 0.05 ℃, Fig. 15 (a)). In addition, the heat removal (Qair,predicted) was calculated using the predicted SAT (SATpredicted) and OAT (Eq. (8). As shown in Fig. 15 (b), the model predicted that the heat removal (Qair,predicted, Eq.(8)) would increase as the number of operating CDUs increased. In other words, the model could effectively capture the dynamic behavior of the cooling system under various control scenarios that did not exist in the normal operational dataset (CDU1, CDU2, and CDU3). In other words, D1 could be useful to provide general knowledge about the dynamics of the target system. However, please note that Fig. 15 compares the synthetic data model\u2019s prediction with the synthetic dataset, not with the data measured from the target system. (8) Q air , p r e d i c t e d = Cap air ∙ ( O A T - SAT predicted ) 5.2 Comparison between synthetic data model, imbalanced data model, and transfer learning model In this study, two baseline models were used: (1) a synthetic data model (MD1) and (2) an imbalanced data model (MD2). As described in Section 5.1, MD1 was trained using only the synthetic dataset (D1) generated using the EnergyPlus model. By contrast, MD2 was trained using the imbalanced dataset (D2) gathered from the target building during normal operation periods. The proposed transfer learning model (MTL) was compared with the two baseline models. Please note that the architecture and hyper parameters of MD1, MD2 and MTL were set to be same. The prediction accuracy of the three models (MD1, MD2, MTL) was assessed with the full dataset (D3) in terms of CVRMSE and MAE. As shown in Fig. 16 , MTL could predict SAT with higher accuracy (CVRMSE: 5.4 %, MAE: 0.96 ℃) compared to MD1 (CVRMSE: 20.2 %, MAE: 4.13 ℃) and MD2 (CVRMSE: 13.0 %, MAE: 1.82 ℃). Although MD1 showed high accuracy when tested with D1, it underperformed against D3. It can be said that even though D1 contains general behavior or knowledge about a cooling system with four CDUs, it is still insufficient to describe the specific target system. MD2 was found to be inferior to MTL, which is not surprising. This is because D2 was not rich g enough to represent the target system. Finally, MTL, or fine-tuned MD1 using D2 by transfer learning, performs best owing to transferred knowledge. Fig. 17 and Table 1 present the results of the three models, depending on the number of operating CDUs. MD1 tended to underestimate the SAT as more CDUs were turned on (Fig. 17(a)). Meanwhile, MD2 could predict the SAT accurately when all four CDUs were operating (Fig. 17(b)), even better than the MTL (CVRMSE: 4.2 % vs. 5.3 %, MAE: 0.64 ℃ vs. 1.10 ℃; Table 1). However, MD2 could not accurately predict SAT when one, two and three CDUs were operating because MD2 was trained with the measured imbalanced dataset (D2) (Fig. 3). This signifies a limitation of the data-driven model, lack of extrapolation capability. In contrast, MTL could satisfactorily predict the SAT for all possible control scenarios (Table 1). In particular, under one, two, and three operating CDUs, the MTL could predict SAT with marginal error, even though the model did not see the data during the training. This indicates that prior knowledge of the synthetic data model acquired from D1 could help the model learn and predict the behavior of the target cooling system. For the purpose of validating the three models, we compared the predicted heat removal, Qair,predicted (Eq. (8) with the measured heat removal, Qair (Eq.2) (Fig. 18 ). The following few points are noteworthy: \u2022 Fig. 18(a) shows that the synthetic data (D1) provides the general knowledge of the cooling system running with four CDUs (Fig. 18(a) vs. Fig. 18(d)). However, MD1 overestimated the amount of heat removal by the cooling system under all four control scenarios. It is speculated that MD1 had to rely on the nominal heat change efficiency ( ε , Eqs.3\u20134) due to a lack of in-situ measured data. In this study, it seems that the actual heat change efficiency is less than the nominal one. The less actual ε might be caused by the degraded status of the heat exchange efficiency. Hence, it can be said that MD1 learned the nominal system behavior from D1 which could be useful as source knowledge. \u2022 The measured imbalanced data (D2) could provide partial knowledge of the specific target system because as mentioned earlier, most of D2 were obtained under four operating CDUs (Fig. 8). Due to lack of balanced data, MD2 predicted unrealistic heat removal as shown in (Fig. 18(b)). For example, Qair,predicted under two operating CDUs was estimated lower than 0. In addition, Qair,predicted under a single operating CDU is greater than that under three operating CDUs. This signifies that the data-driven model with the imbalanced data could produce biased or inaccurate results. \u2022 MTL could accurately predict the dynamic behavior of the target system (Fig. 18(c) vs. Fig. 18(d)). It can be inferred that the synthetic data (D1) could provide rich enough knowledge, whereas the imbalanced data (D2) were useful for calibrating MD1. Because generating synthetic data is usually much easier than gathering data from existing buildings, applying TL from virtual buildings to existing buildings, as exemplified in this study, could overcome the data imbalance issue for model development. 5.3 Discussion The results indicate that the TL from a virtual building to an existing building can be beneficially used for building cooling/heating system\u2019s control. However, it is worth mentioning the following issues that we found during this study: \u2022 Generalizability of the proposed TL should be further investigated. In this study, the proposed TL approach was specifically applied to the DOAS with four CDUs. A building generally comprises of many different mechanical systems and plants. Thus, the applicability of the proposed TL across the heterogeneous systems requires more in-depth and/or analytical/empirical exploration. \u2022 Quantification method of transferability between different systems needs to be developed. This can be understood as a pre-requisite to attempt the aforementioned issue \u201cGeneralizability of the proposed TL\u201d. In this study, based on our engineering intuition, we selected the DOAS with four cooling coils as a source model for generating the synthetic data. As a result, it was found that the DOAS with four cooling coils is good enough to provide knowledge for the target system of four CDUs. However, a critical question still remains untouched in this study regarding the analytical/empirical quantification method of the transferability between two different systems. This would be an interesting challenge in near future. 6 Conclusion When making data-driven models for building control, even if several years of data are available, one faces an input coverage problem i.e. data imbalance problem. To address this data imbalance problem, this study proposes a transfer learning (TL)-based data-driven model development framework for building control. The TL-based data-driven model is trained to predict the supply air temperature (SAT) of a dedicated outdoor air system (DOAS) with four condenser units (CDUs). The machine learning model was trained using two types of data: (1) synthetic data (D1) and (2) measured imbalanced data (D2). First, the model acquired the source knowledge and theoretical dynamics of the target system from D1 generated by the EnergyPlus model. Subsequently, by fine-tuning with D2, the knowledge of the model was customized for the specific target system. The accuracy of the transfer learning model (MTL) was compared to two baseline models: (1) the synthetic data model trained only with D1, and (2) the imbalance data model trained only with D2. It was shown that the MTL outperformed the two baseline models. In particular, the MTL could capture the dynamic behavior of the specific target system under varying control scenarios that were not observed during the training phase with the measured imbalanced data (D2). In other words, the results demonstrate that transfer learning offers a method for amalgamating source knowledge with field data. Existing studies have demonstrated the application of both first-principles-based and data-driven models for building control. However, these studies also revealed the inherent limitations of each approach. The TL-based modeling approach paves a new way to complement both approaches. By transferring knowledge from virtual to existing cases, the proposed framework can overcome the data imbalance issue of the data-driven approach while easing the labor-intensive gathering data in in-situ environment. The SAT prediction model developed in this study can be combined with an energy prediction model and indoor temperature prediction model for space(s) served by the HVAC system. Such combined or federated simulation model can interpret the dynamic relationship between energy use of relevant mechanical systems (chiller, fan, pump), and variations in SAT and IAT. The real-life MPC application depending on SAT and IAT prediction models and energy prediction model can be found in Ra et al. [17]. Although this study demonstrated the applicability of transfer learning for the target cooling system control, many remaining issues must be investigated in the follow-up studies, e.g. applying transfer learning to different types of mechanical and electric systems including heating system, lighting system, renewable energy systems, etc. In addition, the authors will aim to quantify the transferability between different building systems.

        "dc:description": "This paper proposes a transfer learning (TL)-based control-oriented model development framework. In particular, this study examines the transferability from virtual (source) to existing (target) buildings to overcome the data imbalance issue of the data-driven approach. The target system is a cooling system comprising two supply air fans and four condensing units. First, synthetic data rich enough to provide fundamental knowledge about the target system were generated using the EnergyPlus model. A data-driven model was subsequently developed to learn the underlying dynamics of the system. By adopting TL using an imbalanced dataset measured from the target system, the knowledge that the model learned from the virtual data was transferred to the target system of the existing building. The results showed that the transfer learning model could accurately describe the dynamic behavior of the target system and predict the supply air temperature with marginal errors (CVRMSE: 5.4%, MAE: 0.96 ℃). In other words, the TL from virtual to existing buildings can overcome the data imbalance issue for developing a reliable data-driven model.",
