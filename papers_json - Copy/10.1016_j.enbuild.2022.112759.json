Recent research has indicated a significant potential for providing demand response using Economic Model Predictive Control (E-MPC) of radiators in residential space heating systems. Previous studies indicate the need for distinct temperatures in different rooms, which would require an E-MPC with different temperature constraints across the dwelling. Studies on E-MPC concepts for this purpose often assume that it is possible to measure the heating power delivered to each room separately. However, this assumption is not valid in typical existing residential buildings heated by hydronic radiators; they only have one heat meter measuring the heating use of the entire housing unit. This study presents a simulation-based study of a novel dual-zone E-MPC scheme that relies on indoor air temperature measurements in individual rooms of the housing unit, and only one heat meter measuring the total heating use for space heating and domestic hot water. The results indicate that the proposed scheme has the same load shifting potential as an E-MPC using room-level heat metering. The proposed scheme thus reduces the additional hardware and data infrastructure needed for the practical realization of E-MPC of residential space heating systems for demand response purposes.

The basic principle to realize this potential is to modulate the heating power over time while keeping the indoor temperature within a comfortable range. This way, thermal energy can be stored in the building's thermal mass during a period of \u2018heat boosts\u2019 (charging) and released again once the boost is terminated (discharging) thus reducing the need for space heating in the release period. An appropriate charging/discharging procedure for a specific building can be realized using Model Predictive Control (MPC) \u2013 a control strategy that recently has gained the largest research interest for unlocking building energy flexibility [9]. The potential of MPC to decrease energy costs, CO2 emissions, and peak heat demand has been demonstrated in several simulation-based studies [1,10,11] and has been shown to outperform rule-based control schemes (RBC) [12]. Some drawbacks of MPC that have limited its application in real buildings are the investment costs for the additional equipment needed for collecting data [13] and the challenges of developing a control model [9,14]. There are only a few examples in the literature reporting on experiences with physical implementation and tests of MPC in residential space heating systems. Knudsen et al. [15] reported the realization of an energy cost saving of 22.5 % and a peak load reduction of 82 % compared with a constant setpoint baseline controller in an experiment where a novel economic MPC (E-MPC) setup was used for thermostatically control of the only hydronic radiator in a highly insulated residential building located in Trondheim, Norway. This is not a typical setup in older and less insulated residential buildings; here, there is often a radiator in each room to maintain or differentiate comfort temperature. Previous studies indicated that dwelling occupants prefer different temperatures in different rooms and, in particular, prefer lower temperatures in the bedroom [16\u201318]. This was a reason why Christensen et al. [19] in their experiment featuring three single-family-one-story houses located in Aalborg, Denmark, divided each house into \u2018active\u2019 zones and \u2018passive\u2019 zones. The setpoints of the radiators in the \u2018active\u2019 zones were subject to the typical fluctuating behavior of E-MPC while the radiators in the \u2018passive\u2019 zones tracked a user-defined constant setpoint. Their experimental data indicated tendencies for peak shifts, but quantification was abandoned due to the poor resolution of heat meter data. Amato et al. [20] also mimicked the typical behavior of E-MPC in a limited number of \u2018active\u2019 rooms while \u2018passive\u2019 zones had constant user-defined setpoints. The results indicated a load shift of the heating consumption in the \u2018active\u2019 rooms but the load shift for the whole building was limited due to the hydronics of the radiator system. The acknowledgement of a need for differentiated indoor temperatures across the dwelling has also been the subject of simulation-based studies. Few studies investigated the effect of zoning on energy flexibility using rule-based control (RBC) strategies. Johnsen et al. [21] investigated a case building located in Oslo, Norway, where they decoupled the bedrooms from the RBC strategies intended to provide energy flexibility. This reduced the potential for peak reductions of the RBC strategy between 30 and 100 % depending on the thermal mass and preferred bedroom temperature compared with a constant setpoint baseline controller. Péan et al. [22] found a slight loss of comfort but a reduction of 20 % in energy cost savings using heating setpoint schedules that differentiated between day and night living zones in a residential building in Barcelona, Spain, compared to a reference strategy without setpoint modulation. There are also a few simulation-based studies that investigated the performance of MPC with different temperature constraints in different rooms. Zhang and Kummert [23] simulated an MPC in a single-family house in Canada, where two zones were actively controlled and the bedroom was kept at a constant temperature setpoint. The MPC using a reduced-order grey-box model showed a load shifting potential 30 % higher than an RBC strategy. Emrah and Aysegul [24] developed an MPC framework for peak load reduction and coordination of energy storage and renewable power generation in which distinct temperature setpoints are sent to the room thermostats. The concept was tested in an educational building in Izmir, Turkey, and it was found that the MPC reduced the peak load by 23 % compared to a constant setpoint baseline controller. Common for these studies was that they assumed that it is possible to measure the heating power delivered to each room separately. However, this assumption is not valid in typical existing residential buildings heated by hydronic radiators; they only have one heat meter measuring the heating use of the entire housing unit. The aim of the study reported in this paper was therefore to develop a dual-zone E-MPC scheme for a dwelling relying on indoor air temperature measurements in the individual room, and only one heat meter measuring the total dwelling heating use for space heating and domestic hot water. The hypothesis is that it is possible to enable dwellings to provide demand response to district heating systems using this minimal setup. 2 Method The proposed E-MPC scheme is based on the approach reported by Amato et al. [20] where a dwelling is divided into an \u2018active\u2019 zone - i.e., the group of rooms where the fluctuating room temperature of E-MPC is allowed -, and a \u2018passive\u2019 zone \u2013 i.e., the group of rooms where a constant user-defined room temperature is preferred. The method assumes that every room of the dwelling has radiators controlled by thermostatic valves and that the setpoint of the thermostats in the rooms belonging to the \u2018active\u2019 zone can be remotely controlled. Furthermore, each room must have an online room air temperature sensor. It is also assumed that there is an online smart heat meter measuring the total dwelling heating used for space heating and domestic hot water in a resolution of 0.1 kWh/h. The following sections outline the proposed E-MPC scheme (Section 2.1), and the co-simulation setup and case building used to investigate the performance of the proposed E-MPC scheme (Section 2.3). 2.1 One heat meter scheme The proposed E-MPC control algorithm referred to as the \u201cOne meter model\u201d is formulated as a linear program, as shown in Eqs. (1)\u2013(6). The slack variables added to obtain soft output constraints are not reported in Eqs. (1)\u2013(6) for simplicity. Eq. (1) represents the sequence of control heat inputs u k within the prediction horizon k = 0 , ⋯ , N - 1 that minimizes the total heating cost. The heating cost in each time-step k is the product of the energy price c k and the heat input u k . The state-space control model describing the system dynamics is formulated by Eqs. (2) and (3), where x k + 1 | 0 , y k + 1 | 0 are the model states and outputs, respectively, in time-step k + 1 predicted in time step 0, and x k | 0 and d k | 0 are the states and disturbances in time-step k predicted in time step 0. The constraints on the control output and input are set by Eqs. (4) and (5). Eq. (6) sets the initial states x 0 | 0 to be equal to the initial states estimated by the Kalman filter, which are updated in every optimization step using the heating power Q - 1 meas , disturbances D - 1 | - 1 meas and indoor temperature T - 1 meas obtained from measurements. (1) min u ∑ k = 0 N - 1 c k u k Subject to (2) x k + 1 | 0 = A x k | 0 + B u u k + B d d k | 0 , k = 0 , ⋯ , N - 1 (3) y k + 1 | 0 = C x k + 1 | 0 , k = 0 , ⋯ , N - 1 (4) 0 ≤ u k ≤ P ¯ , k = 0 , ⋯ , N - 1 (5) T _ ≤ y k + 1 | 0 ≤ T ¯ , k = 0 , ⋯ , N - 1 (6) x 0 | 0 = A x 0 | - 1 + B u Q - 1 meas + B d D - 1 | - 1 meas + K ∙ T - 1 meas - C x 0 | - 1 The equations described above adhere to the typical formulation of E-MPC for heating control but differs in the way parameters and variables are calculated or combined. The state space model in Eqs. (2) and (3) describes the thermal behavior of the entire dwelling and is generated using dwelling-level heat measurements and the volume-weighted average of room-level temperature measurements. The control input u k denotes the total heat consumption and the controlled variable y k + 1 | 0 denotes the volume-weighted average temperature in the dwelling. Consequently, the Q - 1 meas is assumed to be measured heat consumption of the dwelling and T - 1 meas the volume-weighted average of the measured temperatures in the dwelling rooms. The proposed MPC scheme thus relies on the assumption that a dwelling with different setpoints in different rooms can be sufficiently represented by a control model with the average setpoint in the house as a single output. The temperature constraints of the two zones should be combined into one set of output constraints since the model only has a single output. The upper and lower bounds on the control output T ¯ and T _ are calculated from the volume-weighted average of the maximum and minimum temperature setpoints in the two zones. The active zone temperature setpoint is varied within the two comfort constraints SP _ A and SP ¯ A while the temperature setpoint in the passive zone is kept constant ( SP P ). The formulation is as in Eqs. (8) and (9), where A A and A P are the floor area of the active and passive zone, respectively. (8) T ¯ = SP ¯ A ∙ A A + SP P ∙ A P A A + A P (9) T _ = SP _ A ∙ A A + SP P ∙ A P A A + A P The calculated optimal volume-weighted average room air temperature in the first time-step y 1 | 0 ∗ is used to determine the setpoints for the active and passive zones, respectively. The setpoint of the active zone, SP 1 | 0 A , can be calculated assuming a constant and known temperature setpoint of the passive zone SP P as follows: (10) SP 1 | 0 A = y 1 | 0 ∗ ∙ ( A A + A P ) - A P ∙ SP P A A The setpoint SP 1 | 0 A resulting from (10) is always within the comfort constraints in the active zone SP ¯ A and SP _ A since the control output y 1 | 0 ∗ is kept within the constraints T ¯ and T _ calculated as in (8) and (9). 2.2 Multiple heat meters scheme An E-MPC scheme denounced \u201cMultiple meters model\u201d that assumes heat meters installed in all rooms of the active zone was developed to investigate whether this yield better performance than the \u201cOne meter model\u201d. The \u201cMultiple meters model\u201d differs as follows: \u2022 The state space control model is not representing the whole house but only the active zone. Consequently, the model uses the heat consumption from the individual rooms in the active zone as an input to compute the temperature of the active zone \u2022 The optimization problem calculates the optimal heat schedule of the active zone directly and thereby the temperature setpoint of the rooms in the active zone SP 1 | 0 A . Because of these differences, some of the variables and parameters described in Section 2.1 were calculated differently as summarized in Table 1 . 2.3 Co-simulation study Fig. 1 depicts the schematic workflow of a co-simulation study featuring a case building for testing the performance of the proposed E-MPC scheme outlined in Section 2.1. The E-MPC control algorithm was implemented in MATLAB which exchanged data with an EnergyPlus model via Building Controls Virtual Test Bed. The hourly heat consumption Q - 1 meas in the E-MPC scheme was calculated as the sum of the simulated heat consumption in the active zone, Q A , j meas , and passive zone, Q P , j meas . The temperature T - 1 meas was calculated as the average of the simulated volume-weighted average indoor air temperatures in the active zone T A , j meas , and the passive zone T P , j meas . The optimization problem was solved with a time step of one hour and a prediction horizon N = 48 h using the MATLAB function linprog. The hourly price c k was determined by a time of use (TOU) tariff expressed in unit cost, meaning that the tariff was normalized to have a mean value of one [12]. The tariff had three levels of price: low price during the night, high price during the morning and evening peaks, and intermediate price in the remaining hours. The intermediate and high prices were set to double and triple the low price, respectively. The hourly weather data input (outdoor temperature and global solar radiation) for the EnergyPlus model as well as the E-MPC scheme were retrieved from the Danish Meteorological Institute [25]. The temperature constraints for the active zone, SP ¯ A and SP _ A , were 20° and 22°, respectively, while the passive zone setpoint was set to 19.5 °C based on measurements from the case building. The setpoint SP 1 | 0 A calculated with the E-MPC scheme was sent to the EnergyPlus model after every optimization time step. 2.3.1 Case building The case building featured in the co-simulation study was the same existing single-family house located in Aarhus, Denmark, as the case building in Amato et al. [20]. The house was built in 1968 and is currently occupied by two adults and two children. The floor plan is as depicted in Fig. 2 where 16 rooms are distributed on one floor with a gross floor area of approximately 220 m2 and a room height of 2.3 m. The house was modeled in EnergyPlus with one \u2018active\u2019 and one \u2018passive\u2019 thermal zones as per Fig. 2. The \u2018active\u2019 zone constituted 37 % of the gross floor area and included the living room, the dining room, and the kitchen. The passive zone included the bedrooms, bathrooms, and utility rooms. The zone division was motivated by comfort considerations and the expected shifting potential (see Amato et al. [20] for further details). This zoning was chosen over room-level zoning to minimize computational complexity and the uncertainty related to defining internal gains schedules in each room. The internal walls within the thermal zone were modeled as internal thermal mass, while the internal walls that separate the two zones were boundaries that allowed heat exchange between the two zones. Table 2 presents an overview of the calibrated properties of the opaque constructions in the house. The double-glazed window was modeled with a U-value of 1.5 W/m2/K and a solar heat gain coefficient of 0.62. The infiltration rate was set to 0.51 h−1 and the air exchange between the zones was assumed to be 0.2 h−1. The internal heat gain from electrical equipment was derived from real measurements of hourly electricity consumption in the house. The occupancy schedule was created assuming occupancy during hours with increased electricity consumption and during the night. An example of combined heat gains from equipment and occupants is shown in Fig. 3 . The EnergyPlus simulation time-step was three minutes and the heat balance algorithm used was \u2018Conduction Finite Difference\u2019. The radiators were modeled as \u2018ideal heaters\u2019 as Pedersen et al. [26] demonstrated that the use of \u2018ideal heaters\u2019 in simulation-based studies of E-MPC for residential space heating yields similar results as the use of computationally more complex dynamics of hydronic radiators. The heating power Q j , z in the simulation time-step j to the zone z was calculated with the following PI equation and constraints on its minimum and maximum values using the control platform Energy Management System (EMS): (11) Q j , z [ W ] = Q MAX ∙ CO bias + K p ∙ e j , z + ei j , z ∙ t s t i , 0 ≤ CO bias + K p ∙ e j , z + ei j , z ∙ t s t i ≤ 1 Q MAX , CO bias + K p ∙ e j , z + ei j , z ∙ t s t i > 1 0 , CO bias + K p ∙ e j , z + ei j , z ∙ t s t i < 0 # where Q MAX was the maximum heat capacity of the radiators of one zone, CO bias was the baseline value of the control output when no correction is needed or when the controller is turned on (0.5), K p was the proportional gain of the PI control (0.33), t i was the integral time (1800 s) and t s was the sample time (180 s). The controller parameters were determined through manual tuning in a field experiment in the case building. The control error e j , z was calculated as the difference between the simulated temperature and setpoint of the zone and the integral error ei j , z was calculated by adding the control error value to the previous integral error. The model was calibrated using the method reported in Amato et al. [27] to minimize the discrepancy with measured heat consumption data. The parameters included in the calibration were the thermal conductivity of the external wall insulation material, the infiltration rate, the maximum intensity of internal heat gains from electrical equipment (using a scaling factor for the daily schedule), the window glazing solar factor and the thermal capacity multiplier. The calibration data used was hourly space heating consumption from the 5th of January to the 11th of March 2021 derived from the total district heating consumption of the case building logged with a temporal resolution of 5 s and a reading resolution of 0.1 kWh. DHW was separated using a statistical time series method [28] before aggregating the data to hourly values. 2.3.2 Control model The control model was formulated as a linear time-invariant state space model using the System Identification Toolbox using the method N4SID in MATLAB. The settings for N4SID followed the recommendations of Broholt et al.[29]: A third-order model with a focus on simulation was chosen and several combinations of horizons were tested in the range 4 ≤ r , s y , s u ≤ 48 . The model with the highest fit was then refined using the prediction error method (PEM). The data for constructing the control model was generated using the coupling of EnergyPlus and Matlab as described in Section 2.2. A temperature setpoint schedule was created in MATLAB alternating a normal operation setpoint (20 °C) with a boost setpoint (22 °C) and sent to EnergyPlus. The normal operation setpoint was maintained for a randomly selected number of hours between 3 and 24, while the boost setpoint was maintained for a randomly selected number of between 1 and 5 h. The simulation results were split into estimation and validation datasets, which covered one month (January 2021) and two weeks (1-14th February 2021), respectively. The volume-weighted average temperature of the thermal zones [°C] was used as model output data, while the input data was composed of the sum of the space heating rates in the zones [W], the outdoor temperature [°C], the global horizontal solar radiation [W/m2] and the sum of the zone internal heat gains [W/m2]. A time step of one hour was chosen based on the recommendation in Broholt et al. [30]. The estimation dataset is shown in Fig. 3. 3 Results The models that resulted in the highest fit on the validation data were selected using the method described in 2.3.2. The 24-step ahead prediction on the validation data is shown in Fig. 4 using the \u201cOne meter model\u201d (where the output data is the average indoor temperature of the dwelling) and in Fig. 5 using the \u201cMultiple meters model\u201d (where the output data is the indoor temperature of the active zone). The percentage in the figure legend expresses the fit ratio, which is calculated as follows: (12) FIT = 1 - ∑ i = 1 N y ^ i - y i 2 ∑ i = 1 N y i - y ¯ 2 where y i and y ^ i are respectively the measured output and the predicted output in timestep i, and y ¯ is the mean value of the observations. These models were used in the E-MPC for a simulation period of seven months (1st of September 2021 to the 30th of April 2022). Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 show the energy consumption and temperatures in a typical five-day period at the beginning of the heating season and in the middle of the heating season, respectively, compared with a baseline simulation where the active zone was kept at the normal operating temperature setpoint (20 °C). The setpoint of the passive zone is 19.5 °C in all simulations. The two figures illustrate that the E-MPC algorithm sets an increased temperature setpoint in the active zone prior to high-cost hours. A comparison between the two periods of the year shows that the duration and the magnitude of the setpoint boost depended on the season. The setpoint calculated by the E-MPC was always within the thermal comfort boundaries but there was a slight overshoot and undershoot of the indoor temperature simulated with EnergyPlus due to the PI controller. The setpoint boost led to the shifting of a part of the energy consumption from high-price periods to low-price periods. The same features are shown in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 for the \u201cMultiple meters model\u201d. Table 3 shows the total energy consumption, the energy consumption during peak hours, and the energy costs in the different scenarios. Both models yielded a lower energy consumption and cost compared to the baseline. The \u201cMultiple meters model\u201d led to marginally lower energy consumption and cost for the house as a whole compared to the \u201cOne meter model\u201d. The table also lists the differences in energy consumption and cost of the active zone calculated as the difference between the baseline results and the \u201cOne meter model\u201d and \u201cMultiple meters model\u201d, respectively, divided by the result for the active zone results in the baseline simulation. The energy consumption and cost are higher in the active zone than for the house as a whole with only marginal differences between the \u201cOne meter model\u201d and \u201cMultiple meters model\u201d. Fig. 10 shows that two models redistribute the energy consumption away from the high-price period and into the low-price period compared to the baseline. The differences in load shifting between the two models are negligible. The marginal difference between the performance of the \u201cOne meter model\u201d and \u201cMultiple meters model\u201d is primarily due to differences in their prediction accuracy. Fig. 11 compares the energy consumption determined by the E-MPC and the energy consumption from the simulation for the two modeling approaches. The \u201cOne meter model\u201d was less accurate especially in the first hour after the heating setpoint was decreased. The reason is that the model predicted the energy consumption assuming the energy stored in the thermal mass of the building was equally distributed in the whole building. The \u201cMultiple meters model\u201d did not have this issue as it only use data from the active zone. Table 4 lists the accuracy of the whole simulation period using the metrics mean bias error (MBE), mean average error (MAE), coefficient of variation of the root-mean-square error, CV(RMSE). Overall, the \u201cMultiple meters model\u201d shows a better prediction accuracy which is also evident from the fit on the validation dataset obtained from system identification in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5. The results listed in Table 3 were therefore obtained even though the model prediction accuracy was remarkably worse for the \u201cOne meter model\u201d compared to the \u201cmultiple meter model\u201d (Table 4). 4 Discussion The obtained cost savings and the load reduction in the high-price period are lower than those obtained in previous studies. The cost-saving and load shifting potential of E-MPC in the experimental study by Knudsen et al. [15] were estimated to be 22.5 % and 82 %, respectively, using the same type of baseline and tariff as in the present study. The reason is that Knudsen et al. [15] applied E-MPC to shift heat consumption of the whole net floor area of the house while in the present study 63 % of the net floor area did not contribute to the E-MPC scheme and therefore reduced the cost savings and load reduction in the high price period for the house as a whole. Furthermore, there is a significant difference in the level of thermal insulation of the building enclosure in the two case studies. Data presented in this paper show that the optimal setpoint calculated by the E-MPC scheme resulted in a repeating daily pattern in the middle of the heating season. The setpoint was always set to the maximum allowed setpoint (22 °C) during the whole low-price period of the night and one hour before the evening peak. The optimal temperature setpoint schedule was more irregular during the shoulder seasons (spring and fall) where the heat demand was lower than the rest of the simulation period (winter). This suggests that a rule-based controller could be sufficient to provide demand response during the coldest parts of the year assuming the time-of-use price signal remains constant while a rule-based controller cannot outperform an E-MPC during shoulder seasons or if prices fluctuate differently throughout the period. It is stressed that the present study investigated the performance of the proposed E-MPC scheme in the absence of forecast errors of future weather conditions and internal gains as well as stochastic occupant behavior. Future studies should investigate the impact of this aspect. 5 Conclusions This study aimed to develop a E-MPC scheme that controls the heating temperature set-point of a part of the rooms of a household using data normally available or inexpensive to obtain in residential buildings: household-level heat consumption and room-level temperatures. This E-MPC concept was tested through a simulation study. The results indicated that the scheme is effective in shifting the heat consumption from high- to low-price periods while keeping the temperature within the thermal comfort boundaries. Furthermore, it can yield the same level of demand response as if the heat output was measured in every room of the dwelling despite the relatively large difference in model prediction accuracy. This is a finding of high practical significance: The proposed scheme only needs a single heat meter for the whole dwelling thus eliminating the need for investing in equipment for measuring heat output at room level. Additional equipment needed for the scheme is room temperature sensors at room level and remotely controlled thermostatic valves in the rooms belonging to the \u201cactive zone\u201d. Future studies should test whether it is possible to realize the potential of the proposed E-MPC scheme in real dwellings.

        "dc:description": "Recent research has indicated a significant potential for providing demand response using Economic Model Predictive Control (E-MPC) of radiators in residential space heating systems. Previous studies indicate the need for distinct temperatures in different rooms, which would require an E-MPC with different temperature constraints across the dwelling. Studies on E-MPC concepts for this purpose often assume that it is possible to measure the heating power delivered to each room separately. However, this assumption is not valid in typical existing residential buildings heated by hydronic radiators; they only have one heat meter measuring the heating use of the entire housing unit. This study presents a simulation-based study of a novel dual-zone E-MPC scheme that relies on indoor air temperature measurements in individual rooms of the housing unit, and only one heat meter measuring the total heating use for space heating and domestic hot water. The results indicate that the proposed scheme has the same load shifting potential as an E-MPC using room-level heat metering. The proposed scheme thus reduces the additional hardware and data infrastructure needed for the practical realization of E-MPC of residential space heating systems for demand response purposes.",
