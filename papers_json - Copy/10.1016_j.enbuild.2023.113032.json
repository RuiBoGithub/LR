The integration of solar thermal collectors (STC) and air source heat pump (ASHP) heating systems has been widely used for building heating. However, these systems have the problems that the STC cannot fully utilize the solar energy at weak radiation, and the ASHP has insufficient output as well as low coefficient of performance (COP) under extreme cold conditions. In this study, a multi-source synergistic and complementary heating system (MSSCHS) with a heating mode selection model based on belief rule base and evidential reasoning (BRB-ER) method is designed. First, the MSSCHS composed of the STC and the ASHP as the main heat sources, and the water source heat pump as the auxiliary heat source, along with its three heating modes under different operating conditions were proposed. Then, a system heating mode selection model based on the BRB-ER method was establish to achieve mode switching. Finally, the MSSCHS with BRB-ER heating mode selection model was tested experimentally. The results show that compared with the conventional ASHP + STC heating system, the solar energy utilization rate of the MSSCHS had increased by 19.3 %, 16.6 % and 8.2 % respectively in three typical days, and the ASHP's COP had increased by 37.7 %- 55.6 % under extreme cold conditions. The high efficiency and stability of the MSSCHS were verified through operational tests during the heating period. Furthermore, by applying in different types of buildings, it is verified that the MSSCHS can meet different heating requirements and has a good applicability. It was demonstrated that the proposed MSSCHS has more efficient heating mode and more accurate mode selection method, which can provide a new research idea for building heating.

In 2020, global building energy consumption accounted for 36 % of global energy consumption [1], and China's building energy consumption accounted for 32 % of the total energy consumption of the whole society [2], therefore buildings, as an important part of energy consumption, should also carry out the structural reform in energy supply. Among the energy consumption of buildings, heating and air conditioning account for 50 % to 70 % of the total building energy consumption, while the current heating methods are mainly based on burning fossil energy such as coal or natural gas [3], which has brought widespread concern about the resulting energy shortage and environmental problems [4]. In this context, the introduction of renewable energy in building energy consumption for clean heating is an inevitable choice to adjust the structure of buildings energy consumption and achieve energy conservation, emission reduction and sustainable energy development. As one of the most abundant renewable energy sources, solar energy has been maturely applied all over the world [5,6]. However, due to the intermittent and unstable characteristics of the solar energy and the time mismatch with users' heat demands, conventional solar heating systems have two disadvantages: firstly, solar energy needs to be combined with other heat sources to meet users' continuous heat demand throughout the day; secondly, solar thermal collector (STC) can only effectively collect thermal energy and directly supply thermal energy to users under strong solar radiation, while under weak solar radiation, most or even all of the thermal energy from the sun will be lost [7]. In addition to solar energy, air source heat pump (ASHP) heating system has also been widely used in building heating in recent years due to its green, renewable and energy saving advantages [8\u201310]. However, ASHP has the problem of insufficient output and inefficient operation under extreme cold conditions. To overcome these drawbacks, the heating systems that combine solar energy with ASHP have been proposed in many studies. G. Panaras et al. [11] and Sterling et al. [12] connected the STC and the ASHP in series so as to reduce the electricity consumption of the system by using solar energy as the heat source for the heat pump units, but this method cannot reliably supply heat to users in the absence of solar radiation or in extreme cold conditions. Guang et al. [13] compared the coefficient of performance (COP) of the system under independent heating by the STC or the ASHP and mixed heating by both in parallel, and the results show that the COP of the system is higher in parallel heating, but this parallel connection method does not take into account the utilization of weak radiation solar energy. Vega et al. [14] compared and analyzed the performance of the system with solar and heat pump equipment connected in series and in parallel, and the results showed that the COP of the system can be improved when the equipment is connected in series during weak solar radiation, and the system performance is better when the equipment is connected in parallel under other conditions. Z. Chao et al. [15] designed a solar-air composite heat source heat pump system with a three-media composite heat exchanger as the system evaporator, and the system has three heating modes: single air source, solar-air dual source, and single solar, which can effectively utilize the solar and air heat energy, however, the structure of its evaporator is too complicated for commercialization. In addition to the structural design of the system, the operational control of the heating system is also the focus of scholars' research. In the literature [9], the mode of the system is switched by comparing the magnitude relationship between the real-time temperature detection value and the set value of the equipment. Caixia et al. [16] used the genetic algorithm to find the optimum of parameters such as the heat pump start-stop temperature and the temperature difference, and then the operation state of the equipment was controlled by the start-stop temperature constraint. Zhiguo et al. [17] adopted the particle swarm algorithm to optimize the equipment capacity and solar collector start-stop temperature for solar-air source parallel heating system, so as to regulate the equipment according to the optimization results. Although all these literatures had achieved good system operation results, they all adopt the conventional IF-THEN rule to adjust the system operating mode according to the temperature threshold, and the reasoning process of this control method adopts a simple take large and take small operation, which has poor flexibility and low accuracy of the reasoning results. In the actual system control, it often occurs that the IF-THEN rule cannot reasonably select the heating mode when the value of the antecedent attribute is close to but has not reached the threshold value, thus resulting in insufficient output due to the equipment working under unfavorable conditions, or energy loss due to the inadequate use of the thermal energy collected by the STC, consequently, reducing the thermal comfort of the user or the energy efficiency characteristics of the system. The belief rule base (BRB) expert system was proposed by Yang et al. [18] on the basis of fuzzy theory, IF-THEN rules and D-S evidence theory. The system introduces a belief framework in the conventional IF-THEN rules to quantify the uncertainties of various types of information, thus accurately describing the objective uncertainty of the reasoning results, and applies the ER algorithm to fuse the activated rules for reasoning to deal with conflicting evidence, which results in more refined reasoning results [15]. In addition, the BRB model reasoning process is transparent and the physical meaning of the model parameters is clear and interpretable. Currently, the BRB-ER has been widely used in planning, evaluation and decision making because of its advantage of being able to effectively deal with various types of fuzzy uncertainty and incompleteness problems [19\u201321]. Accordingly, the BRB-ER algorithm is used for system heating mode selection in this study. In view of the above analysis, aiming to make up for the shortcomings of the present heating system structure design and to reasonably control the heating system, a multi-source synergistic and complementary heating system (MSSCHS) consisting of two main heat sources (solar collectors and air source heat pump), one auxiliary heat source (water source heat pump) and two sets of heat storage water tanks is designed, and the heating modes of the system under different operating conditions are proposed. In addition, a system heating mode selection model based on the BRB-ER is established to reasonably achieve the complementary switching of the three modes. Through the actual operation test of the system during the several heating period and the analysis of the system performance under different operating conditions, the feasibility of the heating mode selection method based on BRB-ER as well as the high efficiency, stability, indoor thermal comfort and stability of the MSSCHS are verified. 2 Methodology 2.1 Design of the MSSCHS 2.1.1 Basic structure of the MSSCHS The MSSCHS consists of the STC, ASHP, water source heat pump (WSHP), low temperature water tank (LTWT), high temperature water tank (HTWT), fan coil units (FCUs) and other equipment, among which the STC and ASHP are the main heat source of the system and the WSHP is the auxiliary heat source. The introduction of the WSHP is to realize that when the system is heated by the solar energy or the output of the ASHP is insufficient, the thermal energy generated by the STC or ASHP is first collected in LTWT, and then based on the high COP of the WSHP, the low-level thermal energy in the LTWT is quickly and efficiently converted into the high-level thermal energy in the HTWT. The structure of the MSSCHS is shown in Fig. 1 , the two main heat sources are connected in parallel, the main heat source and the auxiliary heat source are connected in series, and the HTWT is connected in series with the FCUs on user side. Based on Fig. 1, a MSSCHS system was constructed for winter heating supply to a dormitory in a park in Yuci, Shanxi, China. The STC and the ASHP were installed on the roof of the dormitory, and the WSHP, LTWT, HTWT, water circulation pumps and the system control cabinet were deployed indoors, as shown in Fig. 2 . The equipment type and parameters of the MSSCHS are listed in Table 1 . 2.1.2 Characteristic analysis of the equipment and the MSSCHS In order to design a reasonable and efficient heating strategy, the working characteristics of the main equipment, the COP of the system and the indoor thermal comfort index are analyzed. The STC absorbs the solar energy radiated to the collector plate and converts it into heat energy, which then raises the temperature of the heat transfer medium inside the heat absorbing plate and outputs it as the useful energy of the collector. The heating capacity of STC is: (1) Q S = A c F S ( τ α ) e I - U L ( T Si - T a ) Eq. (1) suggests that the stronger the solar radiation gets, the greater thermal energy will be generated by the STC; additionally, the smaller the difference between inlet temperature and outdoor temperature is, the greater thermal energy will be generated by the STC. The ASHP adopts the heat pump principle to transfer the low level thermal energy from the air to the high level thermal energy through a small amount of high level electrical energy input, and its heating method is circulating heating. The heating capacity of the ASHP is as follows: (2) Q ASHP = COP ASHP P ASHP The factors that restrict the heating capacity and energy efficiency of the ASHP include the operating environment and the quality performance of each component of the unit. The relationship of the COPASHP with the outdoor ambient temperature and the set outlet temperature of the unit is as follows: under the same outlet temperature setting, the lower the outdoor air temperature is, the lower the COPASHP is; under the different outlet temperature setting, the larger the temperature difference between the outlet temperature settings and the outdoor air temperature, the lower the COPASHP is [22]. The WSHP also adopts the heat pump principle, but differs from the ASHP in that its heat source is the water source. The heating capacity of the WSHP is: (3) Q WSHP = COP WSHP P WSHP The variation rule of the COPWSHP is similar to that of the COPASHP. Under a certain outlet temperature setting, the higher the water source temperature is, the higher the COPWSHP is. But compared with the ASHP, the WSHP has higher energy efficiency. The FCUs mainly regulates the indoor temperature on users' side. The sum of heat exchange capacity of all FCUs in the heating system is the heat load demand of the system, that is: (4) Q load = ∑ i = 1 N Q FCU , i where N is the total number of FCU; Q FCU, i is the heat exchange of the ith FCU. The heat exchange of the FCU is influenced by factors such as the outdoor temperature, users' heating demand temperature and the supply water temperature [23]. In order to ensure the indoor thermal comfort, the lower the outdoor temperature is, the higher the heating temperature setting should be and the greater the heat exchange of the FCU correspondingly. The temperature change of the water in the tank is related to the thermal energy supplied and used by the equipment connected to the tank, as well as the volume of the tank. The model of the HTWT and the LTWT are shown in Eqs. (5)\u2013(9). (5) Δ T HS = Q HS ρ V HS C = Q ASHP + Q WSHP - Q load - Q EHS ρ V HS C (6) Δ T LS = Q LS ρ V LS C = Q S + Q ASHP - Q WSHPin - Q ELS ρ V LS C (7) Q EHS = U s V HS ( T HS - T HSO ) (8) Q ELS = U s V LS ( T LS - T LSO ) (9) Q E = Q EHS + Q ELS where ρ is the density of water; C is the specific heat capacity of water; Q EHS and Q LHS are the heat loss of the HTWT and LTWT respectively, which is related to the heat loss coefficient U s of the water tank as well as the temperature inside and outside the thermal storage tank. The operation of the system should ensure the supply and demand balance of various types of energy at all times. The energy balance constraints of the MSSCHS are shown in Eqs. (10) and (11). (10) P grid = P ASHP + P WSHP + P wcp + P FCUs (11) Q s + Q ASHP + Q WSHP = Q load + Q HS + Q LS + Q E In this study, the COP of the system is characterized by the ratio of the thermal energy produced by the system to the electricity consumed by the system, which is calculated by the equation shown in Eq. (12). (12) COP S = Q S + Q ASHP + Q WSHP P grid Eq. (12) indicates that under the premise of generating the same thermal energy, the lower the P grid is, the higher the COPS is. In actual system operation, the thermal energy generated by the equipment is shown in Eq. (13). (13) Q = C m Δ T where m is the mass of hot water output from the equipment; ΔT is the temperature difference between the inlet and outlet of the equipment. In the heating project, indoor thermal comfort is a subjective description of the real user experience and a fundamental way to evaluate the heating system. Fanger [24] classified thermal comfort by dividing it into seven levels {+3 hot, +2 warm, +1 warmer, 0 moderate, −1 cool, −2 cooler, −3 cold} that can represent human thermal sensation, and proposed to use predicted mean vote (PMV) and predicted percentage dissatisfied (PPD) to characterize the mean value of group voting on the seven levels of thermal sensation and the percentage of dissatisfied people. PMV and PPD are currently the most typical thermal comfort evaluation indexes [25], and their calculation equations are shown in Eqs. (14) and (15) [26]. (14) PMV = ( 0.303 e - 0.036 M + 0.0275 ) { ( M - W ) - 3.05 × 10 - 3 [ 5733 - 6.99 ( M - W ) - P a ] - 0.42 [ ( M - W ) - 58.15 ] - 1.7 × 10 - 5 M ( 5867 - P a ) - 0.0014 M ( 34 - T a ) - 3.96 × 10 - 8 f c 1 h c ( T c 1 - T a ) } - ( T r + 273 ) 4 (15) PPD = 100 - 95 × e - ( 0.03353 × P M V 4 + 0.2179 × P M V 2 ) 2.1.3 Heating strategies of the MSSCHS From the analysis in Section 2.1.2, it is obvious that the performance of the heating system is closely related to the meteorological conditions and users' demands. In order to effectively compensate for the shortcomings of conventional STC or ASHP heating systems and improve the COPS while meeting the indoor thermal comfort requirements, a synergistic and complementary heating strategy of the MSSCHS is developed according to the system operating conditions. In which, \u201csynergistic\u201d refers to the cooperative work of the main heat source and the auxiliary heat source in order to achieve the heating goal; \u201ccomplementary\u201d means that the system switches heating modes according to different operating conditions, so as to achieve complementary heating of different main heat sources. Three heating modes of the MSSCHS are as follows. Mode 1: Cooperative heating by the STC and WSHP. When solar radiation is available, the thermal energy is exchanged from the STC to the LTWT to reduce the difference between the collector plate inlet water temperature and outdoor temperature, so as to increase the heating capacity of the STC when there is weak solar radiation. Meanwhile, the LTWT is employed as the heat source of the WSHP to improve the energy efficiency of the WSHP. When the water temperature of the LTWT meets the heat exchange requirement of the WSHP, the WSHP will exchange the heat from the LTWT to the HTWT and supply thermal energy to the users. The system operation diagram of Mode 1 is presented in Fig. 3 (a). Mode 2: Independent heating by ASHP. When the outdoor temperature does not meet the extreme cold conditions or there is no solar radiation, the ASHP takes up the heating task independently. As is shown in Fig. 3(b), the ASHP absorbs low-level thermal energy from the air and converts it into high-level heat energy and outputs it to the HTWT. Mode 3: Cooperative heating by the ASHP and WSHP. When the STC or the ASHP is unable to fulfill the heating task under extreme cold conditions, the ASHP and WSHP work together to fulfill the heating task. The ASHP is first controlled to output medium temperature water that can guarantee its operation in high COP to the LTWT, and then the WSHP exchange the heat from the LTWT to the HTWT. The operation diagram of the system is illustrated in Fig. 3(c). Mode 3 works in the same way as Mode 1 except for the main heat source. This mode has two advantages: first, it achieves higher temperature heating under extreme cold conditions, which improves the indoor thermal comfort of users; second, it increases the heat source temperature of the WSHP while lowering the outlet water temperature setting value of the ASHP, thus reducing the heat source and outlet water temperature difference of the heat pump unit and improving the COP of the ASHP and WSHP. The system's operation logic is shown in Fig. 4 . Mode 1 is commissioned when the STC meets the heat collection conditions and the water temperature of the LTWT meets the heat exchange conditions of the WSHP, Mode 2 is commissioned when the weather is not extreme cold and the WSHP is not working, and Mode 3 is commissioned when the system is operated under extreme cold weather conditions. By designing a reasonable and feasible heating mode selection method, the data such as the meteorological conditions, users' demands and the equipment output are analyzed in real time to obtain the heating mode of the system. And then the PLC controller controls the equipment to execute the corresponding operation commands, thus enabling the complementary work of the three heating modes. 2.2 Heating mode selection model based on BRB-ER From the analysis in Section 2.1.3, it is clear that reasonable adjustment of the heating mode of the system is the key to ensure the stable and efficient operation of the heating system. Based on the advantage that BRB-ER has the ability to deal with various types of fuzzy uncertainty problems and its ability to give more accurate reasoning results, this study adopts the BRB-ER method for heating mode selection. The structure of the designed heating mode selection model is shown in Fig. 5 , which mainly contains three parts: the establishment of belief rule base, ER reasoning and the optimization of model parameter. 2.2.1 Establishment of the BRB The knowledge base of the BRB consists of multiple belief rules, where the antecedents of the belief rules are the parameters that affects the mode reasoning results and their referenced values, and the result part is the reference values of the mode judgment results and their belief levels. The kth rule of the BRB model for system heating mode reasoning can be expressed as: (16) R k : If x 1 ( t ) is A 1 k ∧ x 2 ( t ) is A 2 k ∧ ⋯ ∧ x M ( t ) is A M k , Then y ( t ) D 1 , β 1 , k , D 2 , β 2 , k , ⋯ , D N , β N , k with a rule weight θ k and attribute weight δ 1 , δ 2 , ⋯ , δ M where Rk (k = 1,2,···,L) is the kth rule of the BRB model, and L is the number of rules; xi (t) (i = 1,2,···,M) is the value of the ith antecedent attribute, and M is the number of antecedent attributes in the rule; Ai k is the reference value of the ith antecedent attribute of the kth rule, which is set by the user according to the variation range of xi and the evaluation criteria in the actual application scenario of the system; y(t) is the reasoning result of the system heating mode at time t, Dj (j = 1,2,···,N) is the jth heating mode, and N is the total number of modes; βj , k is the belief level of the jth reasoning result in the kth rule, 0 ≤ βj , k ≤ 1; θk is the weight of the kth rule, 0 ≤ θk ≤ 1; δi is the weight of the ith antecedent attribute, 0 ≤ δi ≤ 1. The factors that affect the results of system heating mode selection are mainly three temperature parameters: the temperature of the solar collector, the difference between the heating temperature setting and the outdoor ambient temperature, and the water temperature of the LTWT. In this paper, x 1, x 2, and x 3 are used to represent these three variables respectively, and they are used as the antecedent attributes of the BRB rule. These three temperature antecedent attributes contain three reference points: low temperature (L), middle temperature (M), and high temperature (H). The reasoning result y contains three reference points: Mode 1 (M1), Mode 2 (M2), and Mode 3 (M3). The reference points and reference values of each variable of the model are shown in Table 2 . When the MSSCHS is applied to different geographical areas, the reference values of each attribute will be changed according to the actual situation. In this study, the belief rule base of the heating mode reasoning model is constructed in an iterative combination way, and there are 27 rules in the rule base. The parameters δi , θk , βj , k in the initial belief rule base are assigned value of 1 according to the expert experience. Due to the limitation of space, the initial belief rule base is no longer listed. In following section, the parameter optimization is carried out for the problem that the initial rule base parameter setting is highly subjective. 2.2.2 Heating mode reasoning based on the ER After the belief rule base is built, in order to judge the heating mode, the ER algorithm is used to make reasoning about the belief rules. The reasoning process mainly includes 3 steps: antecedent attribute matching degree calculation, rule activation weight calculation and rule aggregation. Step 1: Antecedent attribute matching degree calculation. Eq. (17) is used to transform the input temperature information and calculate the similarity between each antecedent attribute and the corresponding reference value. (17) α i k = A i l + 1 - x i A i l + 1 - A i l , A i l ⩽ x i ⩽ A i l + 1 and k = l x i - A i l A i l + 1 - A i l , A i l ⩽ x i ⩽ A i l + 1 and k = l + 1 0 , k ≠ l l + 1 where αi k is the matching degree between the input data and the ith attribute in the kth rule. Step 2: Rule activation weight calculation. According to the results of the input information matching degree, the belief rules in the rule base are activated to different degrees, and the activation weight of the kth rule is calculated as shown in Eq. (18) [18]. (18) w k = θ k ∏ i = 1 M α i k δ i ∑ l = 1 L θ l ∏ i = 1 M α i l δ i where 0 ≤ wk ≤ 1, if wk is 1 for the kth rule, the rule is considered \u201cfully activated\u201d, and if wk is 0, the rule is considered \u201cinactive\u201d. Step 3: Rule aggregation. The ER algorithm shown in Eqs. (19) and (20) is used to conduct the aggregation reasoning for all activated rules in the BRB and obtain the aggregated belief degrees of each mode reference value [18]. (19) β j = μ × ∏ k = 1 L w k β j , k + 1 - w k ∑ j = 1 N β j , k - ∏ k = 1 L 1 - w k ∑ j = 1 N β j , k 1 - μ × ∏ k = 1 L 1 - w k (20) μ = 1 ∑ j = 1 N ∏ k = 1 L w k β j , k + 1 - w k ∑ j = 1 N β j , k - ( N - 1 ) ∏ k = 1 L 1 - w k ∑ j = 1 N β j , k where βj is the final belief degree of the jth heating model. The model reasoning results obtained by the ER can be expressed in the form of a belief distribution as shown in Eq. (21). (21) S ( x i ) = ( D j , β j ) j = 1 , 2 , ⋯ , N In this study, the heating mode corresponding to the highest belief degree is selected as the selection result of the BRB-ER model. (22) y = arg max ( β j ) , j = 1 , 2 , ⋯ , N where argmax(βj ) indicates the heating mode Dj that makes βj obtain the maximum value; y is the result of operating mode reasoning. 2.2.3 Parameters optimization of the BRB In the heating mode reasoning model, since the initial BRB parameters δi , θk , βj , k are given by experts based on their experience, the parameter settings are subjective and the judgments are fuzzy. In order to improve the accuracy of mode reasoning, it is essential to optimize the parameters of the BRB. Yang [18] proposed the basic idea of optimizing the parameters of the belief rule base using the back propagation technique, and the expression of the BRB parameter optimization model is shown in Eq. (23). (23) min ξ ( V ) = min MSE ( δ i , θ k , β j , k ) s . t . 0 ⩽ θ k ⩽ 1 0 ⩽ δ i ⩽ 1 0 ⩽ β j , k ⩽ 1 ∑ j = 1 N β j , k ⩽ 1 , i = 1 , 2 , ⋯ , M , j = 1 , 2 , ⋯ , N , k = 1 , 2 , ⋯ , L where V is the vector of model parameters consisting of δi , θk , βj , k ; ξ(V) is the reasoning error, expressed as the mean square error (MSE) between the BRB model reasoning result y and the reference operating mode y ̂ , which is calculated using Eq. (24). (24) MSE = 1 Z ∑ z = 1 Z ( y ( z ) - y ̂ ( z ) ) 2 where Z is the total number of training samples for model optimization. In this study, the optimal value of the BRB parameter is solved by the FMINCON function, a MATLAB function for solving the minimum of nonlinear multivariate functions, which enables finding the optimal value of the parameter under nonlinear constraints [27]. In addition, to prevent the overfitting problem in the BRB parameter optimization training, the optimization model is trained by the k-fold cross-validation method, which randomly divides the data set D into k mutually exclusive subsets of the same size and consistent data distribution by stratified sampling, and randomly selects k-1 subsets each time as the training set and the remaining one as the validation set so as to obtain k sets of training and validation sets. After conducting k times of training and validation, it will finally return the model and parameters that minimize the bias of cross-validation. In addition, the stability and fidelity of the assessment results of the cross-validation method depend largely on the value of k, and the related literature shows that the estimation accuracy bias is smaller when the value of k is 5 or 10 [28,29]. 2.2.4 Optimization results of the BRB-ER model In this study, the optimization model is trained using a 5-fold cross-validation method, and the data sets of the parameter optimization model are the operational data of the MSSCHS in the heating period of 2020\u20132021, with a total of 1000 sets of data. In each optimization, 800 data sets are used for training and 200 data sets are used for validation, with the validation sets varying from each other during each optimization, thus enabling training and validation of the model on the entire data set. The MSE values were used to verify the model accuracy during the training process, and the parameters corresponding to the smallest MSE were applied to the BRB-ER as the optimal parameters. The optimized BRB-ER rules and the values of each parameter are shown in Table 3 . The MSE value of the mode reasoning results of the initial BRB-ER model and the optimized BRB-ER model are 0.4096 and 0.0673, respectively. 3 Verification of the BRB-ER heating mode selection model In this study, the proposed BRB-ER heating mode selection model was verified through simulation and experimental studies. 3.1 Comparison of the optimized BRB model and the initial BRB model In order to further verify the reasoning accuracy of the optimized BRB, 54 other data sets in the system operation phase from 2020 to 2021 were used as the test set for heating mode reasoning using the initial BRB and the optimized BRB model, respectively, and the mode selection results for the system are shown in Fig. 6 . In the Fig. 6, the expected mode refers to the mode in which the heating system is expected to work at that moment according to the expert knowledge analysis. From the comparison between the selection results of the two BRB models and the expected operating mode, it can be seen that the number of incorrect selection appeared in the initial BRB-ER model and the optimized BRB-ER model are 10 and 3 groups, respectively, with the mode selection accuracy is 81.5 % and 94.4 %, respectively, and the MSE values of the models are 0.2407 and 0.1111, respectively. Therefore, the optimized BRB model has higher model selection accuracy compared with the initial BRB model. 3.2 Comparison of the BRB-ER model with the IF-THEN rule Compared with the conventional IF-THEN rule, the BRB-ER method can reasoning a more accurate and reasonable heating mode. The mode reasoning results of the two methods are analyzed by simulation in the near of extreme cold conditions or the heat exchange conditions of the WSHP to verify the reasonableness of the BRB-ER model. In the simulation model, each temperature threshold of IF-THEN rule is set according to the BRB-ER model parameters and the equipment operation properties, and its judgment conditions are: when x 2 is greater than 75 °C, the meteorological condition is extreme cold weather and the heating mode is Mode 3; the WSHP starts thermal energy exchange when x 3 is greater than 20 °C and stops thermal energy exchange when x 3 is smaller than 12 °C. The simulation results are shown in Table 4 . From Table 4, it can be seen that in Case1, due to the meteorological reasons, the STC heats the water in the LTWT to 18.4 °C and then cannot continue to heat it any further. At this time, the IF-THEN rule judges that the value of x 3 does not meet the heat exchange condition of the WSHP, which makes the system work in Mode 2, thus resulting in the unused and gradual loss of the thermal energy collected by the STC. In contrast, the BRB-ER model makes the system work in Mode 1 by reasoning the belief distribution of each heating mode and selecting the mode with the highest belief level, thus making full use of the thermal energy collected by the STC. In Case2, when x 2 is smaller than 75℃, the IF-THEN rule judges that the system does not meet the condition of switching to Mode 3, and makes the system work in Mode 2. This time, the ASHP works in unfavorable conditions due to the large difference between the output temperature setting and outdoor air temperature, and the problem of insufficient output and low energy efficiency occurs. But the BRB-ER model makes the system work in Mode 3, thus improving the COP of the heat pump equipment while ensuring the thermal comfort. From the comparison results, it can be inferred that the BRB model can obtain a more accurate heating mode selection result, thus avoiding the problems of insufficient output or energy loss caused by the conventional IF-THEN rule which cannot reasonably select the heating mode near the temperature threshold. Therefore, the BRB-ER method is more suitable for the heating mode selection of the MSSCHS. 3.3 Feasibility verification of the BRB-ER model in actual application The BRB-ER heating mode selection model designed in Section 2.2 is applied to the actual system shown in Fig. 2, and the operation data of typical day 1 (December 25, 2021, −15 to −4 ℃, weak solar radiation), typical day 2 (January 18, 2022, −10 to 5 ℃, stronger solar radiation) and typical day 3 (February 26, 2022, −2 to 10 ℃, strong solar radiation) were used to analyze whether the model could reasonably select the system heating mode under different solar radiation and outdoor temperature. The meteorological data of the three typical days are shown in Fig. 7 . Since there was no extreme cold weather in Yuci during the heating period, this study analyzed the operation characteristics of the system by setting the antecedent attributes of the mode selection model to meet the extreme cold conditions on typical day 1. According to the national residential heating standard requirements [30], the heating temperature settings for the three typical days were 40 to 50 °C, 40 to 45 °C, and 45 to 50 °C, respectively. The heating mode of the system and the temperature or outlet water temperature of the major equipment within the three typical days are shown in Fig. 8 . From Fig. 8(a), it can be seen that the three modes work complementarily to fulfill the heating task under extreme cold conditions, and the heating modes for this day were: in 00:00\u201308:00 and 18:00\u201324:00, the BRB-ER model judged that the difference between the heating temperature setting value and the outdoor ambient temperature met the extreme cold condition, therefore, the heating mode coordination control system adjusted the heating system worked in Mode 3 by controlling the state of each device; in the period from 08:00 to 15:00, with the increase of outdoor temperature, the system operating condition turned into non-extreme cold condition, but the water temperature of the LTWT did not meet the heat exchange condition of the WSHP, the system works in Mode 2; meanwhile, from 10:30 to 16:00, the temperature of the STC met the heat collection condition, and the STC collected heat to the LTWT; in 15:00\u201318:00, the BRB-ER model judged that the water temperature of the LTWT met the heat exchange condition of the WSHP, and the system switched into Mode 1. Similarly, from Fig. 8(b), (c), it can be seen that on the typical days 2 and 3, due to the small difference between the setting heating temperature and the outdoor temperature, which did not meet the extreme cold condition, the BRB-ER model, according to the meteorological conditions and equipment status, controlled the system to achieve heating through the complementary work of Mode 1 and Mode 2 at each time within the day. From the experimental results, it is evident that the BRB-ER method can effectively make a reasonable selection of heating modes according to the actual operating conditions. By comparing with the initial BRB-ER model and the traditional IF-THEN rule, it is verified that the BRB-ER heating mode selection model designed in this paper has more accurate mode selection results. And the experimental results of the BRB-ER heating mode selection model show that the model can reasonably select the heating mode according to the operating conditions. 4 Experimental results and discussion After verifying the accuracy and feasibility of the BRB-ER model, in this section, the MSSCHS with BRB-ER heating mode selection model was experimentally studied to analyze its solar energy utilization rate, the COP of the equipment and the system, heating comfort index and stability under different operating conditions. In the experiments, the inlet and outlet water temperature, the flow rate and the electricity consumption of the equipment were measured by installing flow meters, thermometers and electric meters, and the performance of the MSSCHS under different operating conditions was analyzed by calculating the thermal energy production and COP using Eqs. (12) and (13). 4.1 Description of the heating buildings for the case study Taking an industrial park in Yuci Shanxi as the heating buildings for the case study of the constructed MSSCHS shown in Fig. 2, the park mainly includes a dormitory building, two office buildings and other buildings, the basic information of heating in these buildings are shown in Table 5 . In this study, the dormitory building is used as the heating object to compare the MSSCHS with the conventional heating system, as well as to verify the efficiency and stability of the MSSCHS. The office buildings 1 and 2 are used as heating objects to verify the applicability of the MSSCHS. 4.2 Performance comparison of the MSSCHS with the conventional heating system A conventional ASHP + STC heating system (the STC and the ASHP are connected in parallel, and the system is heated directly by STC when there is solar irradiation and by ASHP when there is no solar irradiation) was built using the same type of STC and ASHP as the MSSCHS in Table 1, and the performance of the ASHP + STC heating system was compared with that of the MSSCHS. 4.2.1 Solar energy utilization under different solar irradiation The advantage of the MSSCHS over the ASHP + STC heating system is the more efficiently use of weak radiation solar energy. A quantitative comparison of the STC heat collection for the two heating systems in three typical days is given in Fig. 9 , with bars representing the solar energy absorbed by the ASHP + STC heating system when operating with the STC collecting thermal energy directly to the high temperature tank and by the MSSCHS when operating in Mode 1, respectively. The operating condition of the STC and the solar radiation intensity data were combined to analyze the performance of the system, and the results showed that: the ASHP + STC heating system directly supplied heat to users by the STC when the solar radiation intensity was higher than 1000 kJ/m2, and the STC stopped collecting heat when the solar radiation intensity was lower than 1000 kJ/m2; while the MSSCHS can still generate high thermal energy when the solar radiation intensity was lower than 1000 kJ/m2. The total solar energy utilization of the ASHP + STC heating system and the MSSCHS in three typical days were 29.6 kW, 82.4 kW, 157.8 kW and 35.3 kW, 96.1 kW, 170.7 kW, respectively. Compared with the ASHP + STC system, the MSSCHS increased the solar energy utilization by 19.3 %, 16.6 % and 8.2 %, respectively. Therefore, the MSSCHS can utilize solar energy more effectively. 4.2.2 Performance of the system under extreme cold conditions Under extreme cold conditions, the ASHP + STC heating system will operate with insufficient output or low energy efficiency due to the ASHP working at unfavorable operating conditions, while the MSSCHS uses the WSHP as an intermediate link for heating, which improves the heating temperature of the system by reducing the difference between the setting output temperature and the heat source temperature of the ASHP and the WSHP, thus ensure the thermal comfort of users and improve the energy efficiency of the heat pump. The variation curves of the equipment outlet water temperature as well as the heating temperature of the ASHP + STC heating system and the MSSCHS on typical day 1 are shown in Fig. 10 , where Tupper = 50 ℃ and Tlower = 40 ℃ represent the upper and lower limits of heating temperature settings, respectively. From Fig. 10(a), it can be seen that the ASHP + STC system supplied heat directly by STC to users when the solar radiation met the certain conditions, and the rest of the time by the ASHP. And the system heating temperature ranged from 39.8 to 43.0 ℃. From Fig. 10(b), it can be seen that the MSSCHS completed the heating task through the synergistic and complementary work of the ASHP, STC and WSHP, and the heating temperature was between 42.1 and 48.9 ℃. It indicates that the MSSCHS has higher heating temperature in cold weather, which better ensures users' indoor thermal comfort. The trend of the COP and the system's electricity consumption are shown in Fig. 11 , where the COP or the power consumption is zero means that the heat pump unit is not working at that time. From Fig. 11(a), it can be seen that the COP of the ASHP for the ASHP + STC system was 1.96\u20132.74, while the COP of the ASHP and the WSHP of the MSSCHS were 2.15\u20132.98 and 4.10\u20134.78, respectively. The MSSCHS improved the COP of the ASHP by 37.7 %\u201355.6 % under the same operating environment. As shown in Fig. 11(b), the electricity consumption of the MSSCHS was higher than that of the ASHP + STC heating system except when it worked in Mode 1 (15:00\u201318:00). The reasons for this result are: on the one hand, the heating temperature of the MSSCHS was higher than that of the ASHP + STC heating system, that is, the system generated higher heat energy; on the other hand, the system was heated by the ASHP in cooperation with the WSHP, which used more heat pump equipment and correspondingly used more electricity for the system. Based on the value of the system electricity consumption and thermal energy production, the average daily COPS of the system was calculated using Eq. (12). The average daily COPS of the ASHP + STC heating system and the MSSCHS were 2.17 and 2.36, respectively, and the MSSCHS increased the COPS by 8.76 %. From the comparison results, it can be inferred that the MSSCHS effectively improved the COP of heat pump and the heating system by working in synergy between the heat source equipment. 4.3 Performance analysis of the MSSCHS 4.3.1 Analysis of the system energy efficiency characteristics The trends of electricity consumption, thermal energy supply and the COP of the system in three typical days in Fig. 6 are shown in Fig. 12 . As can be seen from Fig. 12, the system electricity consumption was the smallest in Mode 1, increased in Mode 2, and was the largest in Mode 3. On typical day 1, the hourly average electricity consumption of the system operating in the three modes were 8.65 kWh, 13.65 kWh and 17.19 kWh respectively, and the electricity consumption of Mode 1 was 63.37 % and 50.32 % of that of Mode 2 and Mode 3 respectively, which shows that the operation of Mode 1 can effectively reduce the electricity consumption and improve the energy saving rate of the system. In addition, the trend of the COPS variation also shows that the COPS was the largest when operating in Mode 1, which indicates that the overall COPS can be effectively improved by improving the utilization of solar energy, that is, the MSSCHS has good energy efficiency characteristics. 4.3.2 Analysis of the system thermal comfort The data such as indoor ambient temperature and humidity on the user side were measured on-site during the three typical days, and questionnaires were developed to conduct ASHARE 7-level indoor thermal comfort questionnaires for users of different ages from 20 to 60 years old, and the content of the questionnaire was developed according to the ASHARE55 standard [31], including information of gender, clothing, amount of indoor activity, and 7 levels of thermal sensation. The actual thermal sensory voting (TSV) information of the users was counted, and the results are shown in Fig. 13 . As can be seen from Fig. 13, 61.82 % of users voted moderate, 20 % voted warm, warmer and hotter, and 18.19 % voted cool, cooler and cold, which indicates that the dormitory thermal environment was moderate during the test period. The frequency of voting between −1 and 1 was 90.91 %, indicating that the majority of users considered the indoor thermal environment to be acceptable. The measured data and the subjects' metabolic rate and clothing thermal resistance recorded in the questionnaire were substituted into Eqs. (14) and (15) to calculate the PMV and PPD values of the three typical days, and the trends are shown in Fig. 14 . It is shown that the indoor PMV values were between (−1\u2013+1) and the values of PPD were less than 27 % during the three typical days, except for individual times, which met the requirements of thermal comfort class II in the current domestic standards GB18049 [26] and GB50736 [30]. Comparing the heating water temperature of the three typical days in Fig. 7 and the PMV and PPD in Fig. 14, it can be seen that the heating water temperature of typical day 3 was higher than the other two days, and its PMV and PPD were also better. Therefore, the higher heating water temperature can effectively improve the indoor thermal comfort of users. Also from Fig. 10, it can be observed that the MSSCHS provides a higher heating temperature to users in extreme cold weather compared to ASHP + STC heating systems, therefore the MSSCHS has better thermal comfort. 4.3.3 Stability analysis of the system Continuous and stable operation is the basic requirement for the heating system. In this study, the system has been tested in several heating periods. Due to the limitation of space, only the operation data of the system for the heating period of 2021\u20132022 are analyzed as an example, and the operation characteristics of the system for each month of this heating period are shown in Table 6 . During the test period, under the control of the heating mode coordination control system based on the BRB-ER method, the heating system can switch the heating mode in real time according to the operating conditions and supply thermal energy efficiently and stably while meeting the heating demands of the users. As shown in Table 6, the heating temperature of the system was within the set temperature range throughout the heating period except for individual times, and the relative error between the minimum heating temperature and the lower limit of the heating temperature setting was −1.1 % at most. The average daily COPS ranged from 2.04 to 3.66, and the MSSCHS has high energy efficiency characteristics. In order to further quantitatively demonstrate the continuous and stable operation characteristics of the system, but due to the limitation of space, after analyzing the meteorological conditions of the heating period in Yuci, only January, which has large temperature variations, large fluctuations in solar radiation intensity and complex weather conditions, and February, which has low overall outdoor temperature and small fluctuations in solar radiation intensity, are selected as typical months in this heating period for analysis. The meteorological data for the two typical months are shown in Fig. 15 . The operation characteristics of the MSSCHS in typical months 1 and 2 are shown in Fig. 16 . As can be seen from the water supply temperature variation curves in Fig. 16(a), (c), the water supply temperature in the two periods of typical month 1 were 39.6\u201346.5 ℃ and 45.2\u201349.6 ℃, respectively, and the water supply temperature of the system in typical month 2 was 44.5\u201349.6 ℃. The relative error variation range between the minimum water supply temperature and the required minimum water supply temperature for each day was −1.1 %\u20130.4 %, and the water supply temperature met the temperature requirements in Table 6, thus the system can supply heat stably and reliably. Additionally, as shown by the variation curves of the outlet water temperature of the ASHP and WSHP in Fig. 16(a) and (c), the heating task was completed by Mode 1 working in complementarily with Mode 2 in the two typical months. Due to the meteorological conditions, the system did not cut into heating Mode 1 for 16 days in January and 6 days in February. The total thermal energy collection hours of the STC and the effective thermal energy exchange hours of the WSHP for typical months 1 and 2 were 118 h, 64 h and 159 h, 125 h, respectively. In addition, as shown in Fig. 16(b), (d), the average daily COPS in typical months 1 and 2 were 2.1\u20132.8 and 2.31\u20133.15, respectively, and the overall energy efficiency level of the system in typical month 2 was higher than that in typical month 1. These indicate that the heating Mode 1 proposed in this study can effectively improve the COP of the heating system by increasing the solar energy utilization rate. 4.3.4 Applicability analysis of the system In actual application, different users have different energy consumption habits and demands. In order to study the applicability of the MSSCHS, the system was applied to the office building 1 and office building 2 in Table 5 from December 6, 2022 to December 7, 2022 and from December 8, 2022 to December 9, 2022 respectively to analyze the system operation characteristics. According to the relevant regulations of the national standard GB50736 [30] on the design values of indoor temperature of public buildings in cold areas during non-use hours and radiant heating, and combined with users' energy use habits, the user heating demand of two office buildings is shown in Table 7 . The results of the system performance analysis are shown in Table 7. The system heating temperature met the setting value requirements, and the frequency of thermal sensory voting values between −1 and 1 was greater than 90 % for both types of office users, thus the indoor thermal environment can be accepted by most users. The indoor thermal comfort indexes PMV and PPD of the office building 1 and the office building 2 met the requirements of thermal comfort level Ⅰ and Ⅱ in the national standard GB50736 [30], respectively. In addition, during the testing period, the COPS ranged from 2.28 to 4.33, and the system had high energy efficiency characteristics. From these data, it is clear that the system can still reliably and efficiently heating for different buildings and users, and the MSSCHS has good applicability. 5 Conclusion Aiming at the problems that the conditional heating system cannot effectively utilize the weak radiation solar energy, and the ASHP that has insufficient output as well as low energy efficiency under extreme cold conditions, this paper proposed a multi-source synergistic and complementary heating system and its three heating modes. In addition, in order to ensure the efficient and stable operation of the system under various operating conditions, a heating mode selection model based on BRB-ER is designed. By constructing the system in a park in Yuci, Shanxi, and analyzing the performance of the system under different operating conditions, the following conclusions are drawn. (1) The heating mode selection model based on the BRB-ER method solved the problem of inaccurate reasoning of the conventional IF-THEN rule near the control thresholds, and improved the utilization rate of solar energy and the COP of the ASHP. (2) The COP of the MSSCHS were improved by using the WSHP as an intermediate link in the solar heating or the ASHP heating under extreme cold conditions. Compared with the ASHP + STC heating system, the MSSCHS increased the solar energy utilization by 19.3 %, 16.6 % and 8.2 % respectively on three typical days, thus effectively improve the COP of the system; under extreme cold conditions, the MSSCHS improves the COP of the ASHP by 37.7 %-55.6 %, and increased the COP of the system by 8.76 %, while ensuring the indoor thermal comfort of users. In addition, during the heating period test phase, the average daily COP of the system ranged from 2.04 to 3.66. (3) The MSSCHS can stably and reliably supply heat to users. During the heating period test phase, the maximum heating temperature deviation of the system was only −1.1 %. (4) The MSSCHS has a good applicability. For the two different types of office buildings and energy demands, the MSSCHS can reliably and efficiently supply thermal energy. More than 90 % of the users can accept the indoor thermal environment, and the PMV and PPD meet the requirements of thermal comfort level I and II in GB50736. In addition, the COPS ranged from 2.28 to 4.33 during the test period. In this study, the control objective of the system was to make the temperature of the HTWT meet the setting value. However, the actual operation data of the system showed that when heating at a constant water temperature, due to the different locations or orientations of the rooms, some users in these rooms would feel that the indoor temperature was hot or cold. In addition, different ventilation habits of users also cause different thermal energy consumption from ventilation, thus lead to fluctuations in the indoor temperature. In further study, it is necessary to account for the ventilation load into the room heat load, and to take the automatic adjustment of the indoor temperature of each room to meet the user's required value as the control objective of the MSSCHS.

        "dc:description": "The integration of solar thermal collectors (STC) and air source heat pump (ASHP) heating systems has been widely used for building heating. However, these systems have the problems that the STC cannot fully utilize the solar energy at weak radiation, and the ASHP has insufficient output as well as low coefficient of performance (COP) under extreme cold conditions. In this study, a multi-source synergistic and complementary heating system (MSSCHS) with a heating mode selection model based on belief rule base and evidential reasoning (BRB-ER) method is designed. First, the MSSCHS composed of the STC and the ASHP as the main heat sources, and the water source heat pump as the auxiliary heat source, along with its three heating modes under different operating conditions were proposed. Then, a system heating mode selection model based on the BRB-ER method was establish to achieve mode switching. Finally, the MSSCHS with BRB-ER heating mode selection model was tested experimentally. The results show that compared with the conventional ASHP + STC heating system, the solar energy utilization rate of the MSSCHS had increased by 19.3 %, 16.6 % and 8.2 % respectively in three typical days, and the ASHP's COP had increased by 37.7 %- 55.6 % under extreme cold conditions. The high efficiency and stability of the MSSCHS were verified through operational tests during the heating period. Furthermore, by applying in different types of buildings, it is verified that the MSSCHS can meet different heating requirements and has a good applicability. It was demonstrated that the proposed MSSCHS has more efficient heating mode and more accurate mode selection method, which can provide a new research idea for building heating.",
