Undergoing a significant transition is demand-side management (DSM), brought about by changes in the energy landscape, including the extensive deployment of renewable energy sources (RES). One of the most important challenges in DSM is dealing with uncertainty. Robust optimization methods are widely known as an approach to deal with uncertainty. However, this method tends to be conservative in its solution because it considers worst-case scenarios. In this study, we develop a robust approach of model predictive control (MPC) to reduce conservativeness and maintain robustness in DSM of smart apartment building (SAB). Consisting of two stages is the robust optimization strategy employed in this study. The first stage involves day-ahead scheduling, where four different optimization approaches are implemented. In the second stage, intra-day scheduling is implemented on the basis of day-ahead operational plan. The application of this technique achieves reduced conservativeness and maintains robustness. The simulation results show that by using the proposed approach, compared to conventional robust optimization, while maintaining robustness, the operation cost of day-ahead scheduling can be reduced by 10.79% and the operation cost of intra-day scheduling can be reduced by 15%.

In particular, demand-side management (DSM) for consumers is attracting worldwide attention [29]. Jamil et al. [11] proposed a DSM for smart grids using machine learning algorithms to maintain the balance between energy supply and demand. Pham et al. [22] proposed a DSM for buildings to improve energy efficiency by using machine learning algorithms to predict the energy consumption of buildings. Wahid et al. [26] proposed a method to perform DSM for smart buildings and maximize user comfort using a hybrid model that combines Firefly and genetic algorithms to improve the optimization process, reduce energy consumption, and increase user comfort. Important for the environment is to approach not only from the power supply side but also from the demand side, leading to the proposal of models equipped with advanced systems, such as smart house (SH). Typically, SH incorporates technologies such as photovoltaic (PV) system, heat pump (HP) water heater, and battery energy storage system (BESS). The time-of-use (TOU) price provided by the general power transmission and distribution companies and optimal scheduling can reduce operation cost for consumers. Oprea et al. [20] proposed a residential DSM using TOU price to smooth out peaks in electricity load. They found that residential demand response based on TOU prices reduced load peaks and electricity prices by up to 33% and 36%, respectively. Pallonetto et al. [21] proposed a residential demand response strategy using various TOU price combined with zone thermal control. They found that the proposed method reduced consumers' annual electricity consumption by up to 15.9% and reduced CO2 emissions by 27%. However, it is difficult to manually minimize power consumption in buildings such as apartment complexes; therefore, the building energy management system (BEMS) was developed to address these DSM problems [14]. Doukas and Psarras [9] proposed an innovative and intelligent decision support model for identifying the need for interventions and further evaluating energy saving measures in typical existing buildings, based on the systematic incorporation of BEMS data such as load, demand and user requirements. Studies have been carried out on how to optimally schedule the power load of BEMS can improve the energy efficiency of operational buildings and ensure the indoor comfort of buildings [19], [12]. In addition, model predictive control (MPC), which is classified as one of the management strategies in BEMS, is an approach that allows consumers to operate more realistically and flexibly [18]. Predictions of building power usage are important to help operational approaches and improve DSM, making better decisions towards reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and energy use [3]. A significant challenge in contemporary research on DSM involves addressing the uncertainty associated with various parameters when optimizing the scheduling of controllable loads. On the demand side, the widespread adoption of PV installations introduces uncertainty, directly influencing equipment scheduling and potentially hindering the minimization of operational costs [23]. To tackle these issues, D. E. Olivares and Kazerani [8] have developed stochastic optimization methods that incorporate stochastic constraints and scenario-based approaches. Addressing uncertainty is achieved by these methodologies, which generate multiple scenarios based on specific probability distributions of parameter prediction errors, with the goal of minimizing expected values for these scenarios. However, the effectiveness of these methods relies on the refinement technology of the scenarios, leading to limitations such as increased computational load. Furthermore, the need for information like probability density functions may complicate the modeling process [2]. Robust optimization and the information gap decision theory (IGDT) approach are known methods of coping with uncertainty without complicating the model. They are widely employed in the field of power systems to model uncertainties in parameters such as market prices and RES outputs [4]. In robust optimization, the bounds of the uncertain parameters are set by the user, and the critical cost of the objective function is calculated on the basis of those bounds. In the IGDT approach, the critical cost of the objective function is set by the user, and the maximum length of the confidence interval is calculated based on the critical value [1]. As mentioned above, to design robust constraints in robust optimization, uncertainty bounds are necessary, but recent literature has shown that operational strategies using uncertainty bounds have worse economics [7]. In addition, while robust optimization considers the worst-case scenario of uncertainty, the probability of the worst-case scenario is very low and can result in an overly conservative solution [10], [6]. Z. Foroozandeh and Vale [28] proposed a robust optimization for residential DSM to deal with the uncertainty of solar power generation forecasts. They adjusted the conservatism level of the solution according to the uncertainty budget, performed an analysis for each conservatism level, and showed that there is a trade-off between robustness and economy. A scenario that is too conservative may result in poor economics and may not be realistic as an operational strategy. Therefore, recent research has investigated ways to reduce the conservativeness of solutions in robust optimization. Considering the time distribution of generation load uncertainty in microgrids, Qui et al. proposed an interval partitioned uncertainty (IPU) set to reduce the conservativeness of traditional uncertainty sets [24]. They constructed an IPU set according to the probability density function and subdivided the uncertainty interval under the conditions of guaranteeing robustness, reducing maintenance, and improving economic efficiency in microgrid operation. Zhong et al. considered the uncertainties of PV, wind generator (WG), and weather in multi-microgrids and proposed a multi-interval convex hull uncertainty set (MCHUS) to reduce the conservativeness of traditional uncertainty sets [30]. They constructed MCHUS by partitioning the uncertainty set into multiple convex hulls according to the sample distribution and probability distribution, making multi-microgrid operation more realistic and reducing conservativeness. However, in the research on robust optimization to reduce conservativeness described above, uncertainty is treated as a variable, resulting in a min-max-min or min-max-max-min problem that includes nonlinear terms, making the model complex. Therefore, it is necessary to linearize the problem using the C&CG method or the big-M method. In addition, these studies require detailed distribution information such as electric load to divide the uncertainty set into intervals. However, in models where behavioral patterns change daily, such as in a residential building, it is difficult to obtain sufficiently detailed distribution information on the power consumption of residents. Therefore, in this paper, we develop MPC-based robust optimization for the smart apartment building (SAB) to reduce conservativeness through modeling that does not require detailed distribution information. We reduce the conservativeness of robust optimization by implementing realistic and flexible operations using MPC and by defining new robust parameters that change over the time horizon. This maintains model robustness while reducing conservativeness. Moreover, the optimization approach utilized in this research comprises two stages, effectively mitigating power shortages and diminishing the rise in operational costs caused by uncertainties. The contributions of this research are as follows: 1) Development of a robust scheduling method: In this study, we develop a two stages robust scheduling method to deal with uncertainty. In the first step, day-ahaed scheduling is performed, and an SAB model electricity purchase plan is created. At this time, optimization is performed for the worst-case scenario. In the second stage, intra-day scheduling is performed, and the power purchase plan is re-created to minimize power shortages. 2) Development of an MPC-based robust approach: When performing robust optimization, there is a possibility of outputting solutions that are too conservative. Therefore, in this study, we develop an MPC-based robust approach and define new robust parameters that change over time. By adopting the developed MPC-based robust approach, it is possible to reduce the conservativeness of day-ahead scheduling while maintaining robustness. 3) Evaluation of robustness and conservativeness: The robust scheduling method developed in this study evaluates the reduction in conservativeness using robust scheduling the previous day, and evaluates robustness by minimizing power shortages using intra-day scheduling. The rest of this document is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the structure of the BEMS. Section 3 describes the optimization problem formulation. Section 4 describes the solution procedure of the optimization problem. Section 5 discusses the simulation results, and the paper is concluded in Section 6. 2 Optimization problem formulation 2.1 Building energy management system It is assumed that the SAB in this study is equipped with a BEMS, that supplies electricity from the grid and renewable energy to meet the electricity load of the SAB. It also supplies heat from the HP water heater to meet the heat load of the SAB. The water in the hot water tank is heated using an HP water heater. The next section describes the modeling of the SAB. 2.1.1 Smart apartment building model Fig. 1 depicts the SAB considered in this study. The system incorporates the installation of PV, HP water heater, and BESS. Furthermore, the HP water heater serves as the heat source. As controllable loads, both the HP and BESS function, with their operation schedules determined through an optimization problem aimed at minimizing the operation cost of the SAB. The operation cost of the SAB model is expressed as follows: (1) C o s t d a y = ∑ t = 1 N t C o s t t e l e ⋅ Δ t (2) C o s t e l e , t = c e l e p u r ⋅ P t p u r − c e l e s e l l ⋅ P t s e l l where C o s t d a y is the operation cost per day for the SAB model, C o s t e l e , t is the electricity cost at t, c e l e p u r / c e l e s e l l is power purchase price/power selling unit price, P t p u r / P t s e l l is the amount of electricity purchased/sold. Additionally, the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of the consumers are calculated as follows: (3) C O 2 d a y = c e l e C O 2 ∑ t = 1 N t P t p u r ⋅ Δ t where C O 2 d a y is CO2 emissions per day for the SAB model, c e l e C O 2 is the CO2 emissions intensity of purchased electricity based on the grid. The equilibrium between power supply and demand in the SAB model must be continuously upheld. It is articulated as follows: (4) P t g r i d + P t d i s − P t c h a + ∑ n = 1 N H P P n , t H P = P t l o a d − P t P V (5) P t g r i d = P t p u r − P t s e l l where P t g r i d denotes the power flow at the junction between the SAB model and the power grid, P t d i s / P t c h a denotes the BESS discharging/charging power. and P n , t H P denotes the output of the HP for one unit, P t l o a d denotes the SAB power consumption excluding controllable loads, P t P V denotes the PV output installed in the SAB. If the SAB residents use too much electricity at the same time, there is a risk of a power outage. To avoid SAB power outages, a maximum variation limit must be set on the power flow at the junction between the SAB model and the power grid concerning the power flow in the previous time step. The limit for power flow fluctuation is defined as follows [5]: (6) | P t − 1 g r i d − P t g r i d | ≤ Δ P g r i d where Δ P g i r d is the maximum fluctuation value of the power flow. In this paper, the SAB model assumes that electricity purchase and electricity sales cannot be executed simultaneously. Therefore, it is expressed as follows using a binary variable that controls the purchase and sale of electricity [5]: (7) 0 ≤ P t p u r ≤ P F m a x ⋅ α (8) 0 ≤ P t s e l l ≤ P F m a x ⋅ ( 1 − α ) where P F m a x represents the maximum power flow, and α represents the control variable for power purchase/sale. In the SAB model, electricity represents purchased from the grid when α = 1 and sold to the power grid when α = 0 [5]. 2.1.2 Photovoltaic This paper presupposes the incorporation of a PV system with rated output C a p P V in the SAB model. Moreover, the solar radiation-derived PV output is determined using the formula outlined below [27]. Because this study focuses on Okinawa, Japan, solar radiation data for the target area are used. (9) P t P V = η P V n P V S P V I P V ( 1 − 0.005 ( T e m p t o u t − 25 ) ) where η P V is conversion efficiency, n P V is the number of panels, S P V is the PV panel area, I P V denotes solar radiation and T e m p t o u t is outdoor temperature. 2.1.3 Battery energy storage system This paper assumes that the SAB model is equipped with a BESS with a capacity of C a p B E S S . BESS's state of charge (SOC) is articulated as: (10) S O C t = S O C t − 1 + P t c h a ⋅ η B E S S − P t d i s / η B E S S where S O C t is the SOC of the BESS, η B E S S is the discharging/charging efficiency of the BESS. Additionally, the upper and lower limits of SOC are limited to prevent battery deterioration [13]. (11) S O C m i n ≤ S O C t ≤ S O C m a x where S O C m i n / S O C m a x are the lower/upper bounds of SOC in BESS. In addition, this paper assumes that BESS cannot be charged and discharged simultaneously. Therefore, to control the charging and discharging of BESS, a binary variable is used and expressed as follows [5]: (12) 0 ≤ P t c h a ≤ C h a m a x ⋅ β (13) 0 ≤ P t d i s ≤ D i s m a x ⋅ ( 1 − β ) where C h a m a x / D i s m a x is the maximum charging/discharging power of the BESS, while β is the control variable controlling the charging/discharging operations of the BESS. When β = 1 , power is charged to the BESS, and when β = 0 , power is discharged from the BESS. 2.1.4 Heat pump water heater model The SAB model is equipped with an HP water heater as a heat source. HP water heaters can use electrical energy to generate thermal energy. Normally, HP water heaters have minimum operating/stopping times set based on the condition of the equipment. The minimum operating/stopping time is constrained as follows: (14) T H P , t o p e ≥ T m i n H P (15) T H P , t s t o p ≥ T m i n H P where T H P , t o p e / T H P , t s t o p is continuous operating/stopping time of HP, T m i n H P is the minimum operating/stopping time of HP. Additionally, this paper assumes that the HP water heater cannot be started and stopped simultaneously. Therefore, the power consumption of an HP water heater is expressed as follows using a binary variable that controls the operating/stopping state. (16) P t H P = P c o m H P ⋅ v H P where P c o m H P is the constant power consumption of the HP water heater, and v H P is a binary variable that controls the operating/stopping state of the HP water heater. The HP water heater operates when v H P = 1 , and the HP water heater stops when v H P = 0 . 2.1.5 Hot water supply system The SAB model proposed in this study assumes that a hot water supply system is installed. The hot water supply system in this context regulates water temperature by blending hot water from the storage tank with city water, providing hot water to individual residents within the SAB. The hot water system described in this paper is formulated as follows [25]: (17) H t H P + H t c i t y − H t s l − H t l o s s = ρ w a t e r A t a n k d T e m p t t a n k d t (18) H t H P = ρ w a t e r A t a n k ( T e m p t a r − T e m p t t a n k ) (19) H t c i t y = ρ w a t e r A t c i t y T e m p t w a t e r (20) H t s l = ρ w a t e r A t s l T e m p t t a n k (21) H t l o s s = δ h e a t ( T e m p t t a n k − T e m p t o u t ) (22) A t s l = A t c i t y = T e m p t s l − T e m p t w a t e r T e m p t t a n k − T e m p t w a t e r A t l o a d where ρ w a t e r is the volumetric specific heat of water, H t H P is the thermal energy by HP, H t s l is the thermal energy lost by hot water supply, and H c i t y is the thermal energy added by city water supply, H t l o s s is the heat loss arising from the temperature variance between the water temperature in the hot water storage tank and the outside air temperature. A t a n k is the hot water storage tank capacity, A t s l is the amount of water used from the hot water storage tank during hot water supply, A t c i t y is the amount of water supplied from city water to the hot water storage tank, A t l o a d is the actual amount of hot water supply, T e m p t t a n k is the temperature of water in the tank, T e m p t s l is the temperature of the hot water supplied, T e m p t w a t e r is the temperature of city water, and T e m p t t a r is the target temperature before hot water is used. Temperature, δ h e a t indicates the heat loss coefficient. In this paper, in order to meet the hot water demand of consumers, it is essential to keep the water temperature in the hot water storage tank within a range that ensures the comfort of the users is not compromised. (23) T e m p t t a n k ≥ T e m p t a r 3 Optimization problem formulation In this paper, we optimize SAB scheduling in two stages. In the first stage, day-ahead scheduling is determined. In this paper, four day-ahead scheduling models are proposed. The electricity purchase plan determined in day-ahead scheduling is input into the second stage. In the second stage, intra-day scheduling is determined. Since intra-day scheduling introduces prediction errors, the SAB model minimizes power shortages. 3.1 Day-ahead scheduling model In the first stage, we optimize day-ahead scheduling in the SAB model. In this study, we set four day-ahead scheduling models: deterministic, robust, IPU-based robust model, and MPC-based robust model. However, since the IPU robust model is explained in reference [24], we will omit the explanation in this paper. 3.1.1 Deterministic model Based on the SAB model and historical data, this model establishes a day-ahead schedule optimization model, that considers the minimization of operation cost. The optimization problem for a deterministic model is formulated as follows: M i n C o s t d a y s u b j e c t t o (4) ∼ (23) 3.1.2 Robust model This model performs robust optimization on the SAB model. This model considers the load and PV output uncertainties of the SAB model and minimizes operation cost under the worst case. The uncertainty set for load and PV output is defined as follows [7]: (24) P l o a d − P ˆ l o a d ⋅ γ l o a d ≤ P ˜ l o a d ≤ P l o a d + P ˆ l o a d ⋅ γ l o a d (25) P P V − P ˆ P V ⋅ γ p v ≤ P ˜ P V ≤ P P V + P ˆ P V ⋅ γ p v (26) 0 ≤ γ l o a d ≤ 1 (27) 0 ≤ γ p v ≤ 1 where, P ˜ l o a d / P ˜ P V is uncertainty sets for load/PV, P ˆ l o a d / P ˆ P V is uncertainty deviations of load/PV, γ l o a d / γ p v is robust coefficients in load/PV that controls the conservativeness of the solution. The scenario where γ l o a d = γ p v = 0 represents the most optimistic case, disregarding the impact of uncertainty. Conversely, when γ l o a d = γ p v = 1 , it corresponds to the worst-case scenario, where the effects of uncertainty are maximized. In addition, the electricity supply/demand balance equation (4) is reformulated as follows: (28) P t g i r d + P t d i s − P t c h a − ∑ n = 1 N H P P n , t H P = P ˜ t l o a d − P ˜ t P V Thus, robust formulation of the optimization problem can be expressed as follows. M i n C o s t d a y s u b j e c t t o (5) ∼ (28) 3.1.3 Model predictive control-based robust model This model performs robust optimization with reduced conservativeness compared with the robust model. In this study, we develop an MPC-based robust approach and define robust parameters that change over the time horizon. The uncertainty set for load and PV output is redefined as follows: (29) P l o a d − P ˆ l o a d ⋅ Γ l o a d ≤ P ¯ l o a d ≤ P l o a d + P ˆ l o a d ⋅ Γ l o a d (30) P P V − P ˆ P V ⋅ Γ p v ≤ P ¯ P V ≤ P P V + P ˆ P V ⋅ Γ p v (31) Γ t l o a d = Γ t p v = { 1 N t t ( t ≤ 72 ) 1 ( t > 72 ) where Γ l o a d / Γ p v is robust coefficients of load/PV that values that control the conservativeness of the solution, P ¯ l o a d / P ¯ P V is the load/PV uncertainty set according to the MPC-based robust approach. In this model, the power supply and demand balance equation (4) can be transformed into an optimal equation as follows: (32) P t g i r d + P t d i s − P t c h a − ∑ n = 1 N H P P n , t H P = P ¯ t l o a d − P ¯ t P V The MPC-based robust approach implements an optimization strategy that takes future data into account. In this study, we develop an MPC-based robust approach to maintain robustness while reducing conservativeness. When the control horizon is k and the prediction horizon is H, the optimization algorithm is executed at [ k , k + H ] to minimize the operation cost of the SAB model on the time horizon. Therefore, the robust formulation of the optimization problem is expressed as follows: M i n ∑ k k + H C o s t d a y s u b j e c t t o (5) ∼ (23), (29) ∼ (32) 3.1.4 IPU-based robust model This model is a method proposed in the literature [24], which considers the time distribution of the uncertainties, constructs an IPU set according to a probability density function, and performs robust optimization to reduce conservatism. The IPU set is constructed by further considering the actual probability distribution under the condition of guaranteeing uncertainty and partitioning the uncertainty set. In this model, the uncertainty interval is divided using the following formula: (33) ∑ b = 1 N b ( Π b , w ⋅ w t b + + w t b − w t + + w , t − ) = Π w , Π b , w Π b + 1 , w = ρ b ρ b + 1 where w is the uncertainty component, b is the bth interval of uncertainty, N b is the number of uncertainty intervals, Π b , w denotes the time budget for interval b, Π w is overall time budget, w t b + is the upper uncertainty deviation at time t for interval b, w t b − is the lower uncertainty deviation at time t for interval b, w t + is the overall uncertainty upper deviation, w t − is the overall uncertainty lower deviation, Π w represents the total time budget, and ρ b is the occurrence probability for interval b. Based on this division, the IPU set is constructed according to the following formula: (34) w t = w t \u204e + ∑ b = 1 N b ( w t b + ϵ t b + − w t b − ϵ t b − ) , 0 ≤ ϵ t b ± ≤ 1 (35) w t ∈ { P ˇ t P V } (36) P P V − P ˆ P V ⋅ γ p v ≤ P ˇ P V ≤ P P V + P ˆ P V ⋅ γ p v (37) 0 ≤ ∑ b = 1 N b ( ϵ t b + + ϵ t b − ) ≤ 1 , ∑ t = 1 N t ( ϵ t b + + ϵ t b − ) ≤ Π b , w (38) ∑ t = 1 N t ∑ b = 1 N b ϵ t b + = ∑ t = 1 N t ∑ b = 1 N b ϵ t b − where w t \u204e is the predicted nominal value at time t, P ˇ t P V is the PV uncertainty set according to the IPU-based robust approach, ϵ t b + is the positive deviation weight at time t for interval b, ϵ t b − is the negative deviation weight at time t for interval b. Equation (36) means that the uncertainty bounds of the IPU set are the same as those of the robust model in section 3.1.2. Equation (37) indicates that, from a spatial perspective, only one deviation of w t can occur in any period, and from a temporal perspective, it is a constraint for the total uncertainty of each interval in the schedule period not to exceed Π b , w . Equation (38) is a constraint for controlling the balance between the upper and lower deviations. In this model, the power supply and demand balance equation (4) can be transformed into an optimal equation as follows: (39) P t g i r d + P t d i s − P t c h a − ∑ n = 1 N H P P n , t H P = P ˜ t l o a d − P ˇ t P V In this model, note the SAB load uncertainty set is the same as the robust model in section 3.1.2. Thus, robust formulation of the optimization problem can be expressed as follows. M i n C o s t d a y s u b j e c t t o (5) ∼ (23) , (33) ∼ (39) 3.2 Intra-day scheduling model In the second stage, intra-day scheduling is optimized in the SAB model. At this stage, we assume that the SAB model has load and PV prediction errors. In intra-day scheduling, the SAB load and PV output are described as follows, considering prediction errors according to uniform distribution. (40) P l o a d − τ m a x ⋅ P l o a d ≤ P O D l o a d ≤ P l o a d + τ m a x ⋅ P l o a d (41) P P V − τ m a x ⋅ P P V ≤ P O D P V ≤ P P V + τ m a x ⋅ P P V where τ m a x is the maximum fluctuation rate caused by prediction error, P O D l o a d is the load of the SAB model in intra-day scheduling, and P O D P V is the PV output in intra-day scheduling. Furthermore, at this stage, information determined in day-ahead scheduling is input as data. Therefore, the power supply/demand balance can be reformulated as follows: (42) P D A , t g r i d + ϕ t g r i d + P t d i s − P t c h a − ∑ n = 1 N H P P n , t H P = P O D , t l o a d − P O D , t P V where P D A , t g r i d is the electricity buying/selling plan in day-ahead scheduling, and ϕ t g r i d is the amount of power adjustment from intra-day scheduling ϕ g r i d is limited as follows by a binary variable that controls the increase/decrease in electricity buying/selling from day-ahead scheduling: (43) ϕ g r i d = ϕ + − ϕ − (44) 0 ≤ ϕ + ≤ ϕ m a x ⋅ ζ (45) 0 ≤ ϕ − ≤ ϕ m a x ⋅ ( 1 − ζ ) where ϕ + is the power shortage due to day-ahead scheduling, ϕ − is the surplus power due to day-ahead scheduling, ϕ m a x is the maximum adjusted power flow in intra-day scheduling, and ζ is Control variable for power adjustment in intra-day scheduling. The SAB model purchases power shortage from the grid when ζ = 1 , and sells surplus power to the grid when ζ = 0 . In intra-day scheduling, an optimization problem is performed to minimize power shortages based on the previous day's electricity buying/selling plan. Therefore, the optimization problem can be expressed as follows: M i n c p e n a ⋅ ϕ + s u b j e c t t o (5) ∼ (23), (40) ∼ (45) where c p e n a is the penalty cost associated with the power shortage. 4 Solution procedure Fig. 2 shows the solution process of the SAB's two stages scheduling optimization model. The specific steps are as follows. Step 1: Input initial data such as solar radiation, outdoor temperature, the SAB load, etc. Step 2: Create scenarios according to each day-ahead scheduling model. \u2022 Deterministic model: Create a scenario without considering uncertainty according to equation (4). \u2022 Robust model: Create a worst-case scenario considering uncertainty according to equation (28).

The uncertainty set is constructed using equations (33)∼(38). Step 3: Model the equipment installed on the demand side using equations (9)∼(23) and solve the optimization problem. After that, create a power buying/selling plan for the next day. Step 4: Intra-day scheduling generates the prediction error and inputs new parameters according to equations (40)∼(41). Step 5: Intra-day scheduling is determined based on the power buying/selling plan determined in day-ahead scheduling according to equation (42)∼(45). Step 6: Determine intra-day power buying/selling plan and evaluate its economical and conservativeness. The optimization problem is executed on a desktop PC with an Intel Core i9-10980XE processor, 64 GB RAM, using MATLAB R2020b. The problem is mathematically expressed as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model and constructed using the MATLAB toolbox. 5 Simulations and discussions 5.1 Parameter description In this paper, the power supply in the SAB model comes from PV output, power purchase from the grid, and discharge from the BESS. In addition, hot water demand is met by controlling HP water heaters. The SAB model takes into account the use of hot water, using 300 L of hot water from 7:00 to 8:00 and 900 L of hot water from 20:00 to 23:00. The parameters of the SAB model used in this study are shown in Table 1 . Electricity prices are shown in Table 2 . The SAB model assumes 16 consumer households and takes nine load patterns into consideration. The load pattern is shown in Fig. 3 . In addition, each load pattern assumes that the number of people and peak load are different, and the details are shown in Table 3 . The power consumption, PV output, and outside temperature of uncontrollable load in the entire SAB model are shown in Fig. 4 . The SAB model is assumed to be located in Naha, Okinawa, Japan. The climate of Naha City, Okinawa Prefecture, is characterized by the hottest summer, relatively high temperatures in spring and fall, and mild winters. Therefore, electricity demand in this area is highest in summer and lowest in winter. To represent this characteristic, this study characterized the seasonal load of consumers as shown in Fig. 4(a). Additionaly, the weather conditions are reflected in the simulation by using historical data on outdoor temperature and PV output for this region from January 1 to December 31, 2020 as input parameters. 5.2 Investigate the duration of predictive horizon This paper examines the duration of the predictive horizon used in the MPC-based Robust model simulations. Table 4 shows the amount of time complexity and operation cost for simulating one year of day-ahead scheduling with the MPC-based Robust model. When the predictive horizon H is 24, the day-ahead scheduling considers data two days ahead, and when H is 48, the day-ahead scheduling considers data three days ahead. From Table 4, it can be seen that the longer the prediction horizon period, the more the time complexity. This is due to the fact that the number of variables to be solved in the optimization problem increases along the predictive horizon period. On the other hand, it can be seen that there is almost no difference in the operational cost of day-ahead scheduling even if the predictive horizon period is lengthened. This is because even considering future data for more than three days, the impact on the first day is not significant. Based on the above, the predictive horizon period is set to 2 days (24 hours) in this paper. 5.3 Day-ahead scheduling 5.3.1 Deterministic scheduling Fig. 5 shows the deterministic scheduling results for day-ahead scheduling. Fig. 5(a) shows the HP up/down state. On the first day, the HP operates during times when PV output is high, and from the second day onwards, the HP operates using inexpensive night-time electricity. Fig. 5(b) shows the temperature of water in the tank. It can be affirmed that the water temperature ascends during the operational period of the HP, reaching the target temperature. Furthermore, there is a swift decline in temperature of water both in the morning and evening, attributed to the utilization of thermal energy from the hot water supply. The scheduling result of the SAB model is illustrated in Fig. 5(c), while Fig. 5(d) displays the SOC of the BESS integrated into the SAB model. On the first and second days, the PV output is high, allowing the surplus power generated to be utilized for charging the BESS. In addition, inexpensive off-peak power is used to charge the BESS. The energy charged to the BESS is discharged to meet the peak load that occurs from evening to night. Furthermore, electricity prices are high during daytime hours when PV output is low, so the energy charged in BESS is used to avoid purchasing electricity during those hours. On the third day, it can be seen that because the PV output is low, BESS is not charged during the day, but instead uses inexpensive late-night electricity for charging. After that, the energy stored in the BESS is discharged during the day when electricity is expensive. 5.3.2 Robust scheduling In robust optimization, uncertainty elements are defined as uncertainty sets. In this study, we consider the uncertainty of PV output and SAB load, and the uncertainty set for conventional robust optimization is shown in Fig. 6 . In robust scheduling, we consider the most worst conditions by utilizing the upper limit of the SAB load and the lower limit of the PV output, as illustrated in Fig. 6. The result of robust scheduling for day-ahead is presented in Fig. 7 . Fig. 7(a) shows the operational status of the HP water heater. In contrast to Fig. 5(a), the operational strategy on the first day differs. In robust scheduling, we assume the most worst scenario that PV output is unavailable for operating the HP water heater. Therefore, it can be seen that HP water heaters are running using inexpensive off-peak power for three days. Fig. 7(b) illustrates the water temperature. Similar to deterministic scheduling, the temperature of the water increases when the HP is in operation and decreases during periods of hot water demand. At this time, it can be confirmed that the previously set target temperature has been reached. Fig. 7(c) shows the operation results of the SAB model, and Fig. 7(d) shows the SOC of BESS. Compared to deterministic scheduling, the PV output is small and the load on the SAB model is increased. Consequently, there is a rise in the purchased power, and a reduction in the BESS charging using surplus power. This is because the worst-case scenario is assumed; therefore, the amount of PV output used decreases significantly, and equipment is scheduled accordingly. Surplus electricity from PV is used to charge BESS only on the first day. However, most of the charging energy comes from late-night electricity. It can be confirmed that the BESS discharges energy during daytime hours when PV output is low and when peak loads occur. Furthermore, on the second and third days, the PV output is low and cannot be used to charge the BESS. Therefore, all the energy used to charge the BESS comes from late-night electricity. Then, it can be confirmed that BESS energy is discharged during times when electricity rates are high and peak loads occur. As a result, the operation cost of the SAB model increases, making it a more conservative operating method than deterministic scheduling. 5.3.3 MPC-based robust scheduling The MPC-based robust scheduling proposed in this paper defines robust parameters that change over time. The robust parameters are shown in Fig. 8 , and the uncertainty set of the PV output and SAB model in the MPC-based robust approach is shown in Fig. 9 . Fig. 10 shows the results of the proposed robust scheduling method for day-ahead scheduling. Fig. 10(a) shows the operation/stop status of the HP water heater. On the first day, it is confirmed that the HP water heater is operating from early morning until midday. Then, it is operated using inexpensive off-peak power. From the second day onwards, it operates using off-peak power. Comparing with Fig. 7(a), it can be seen that the HP operating time is shorter. This is because the set robust parameters reduced the conservativeness. This reduces the operating time of the HP water heater and allows it to operate during the day. Fig. 10(b) shows the temperature of water in the tank. It can be confirmed that the temperature of water increases during the hours when the HP water heater is in operation. At this point, the temperature of water has reached the set target temperature, confirming that the constraints are satisfied. In addition, the temperature of water drops rapidly during times when hot water demand is occurring. Fig. 10(c) shows the operation results of the SAB model, and Fig. 10(d) shows the SOC of the BESS. Comparing with Fig. 7(c), it can be seen that the PV output has increased. This is because the conservativeness is reduced by the newly defined robust parameters. As shown in Fig. 10(c), the PV output is high on the first day, so the surplus power is used to charge the BESS. In addition, the BESS is charged using inexpensive off-peak power. Afterward, it is confirmed that BESS discharges during times when electricity rates are high and times when peak loads occur. From the second day onwards, the PV output is lower than that on the first day, so off-peak power is used to charge the BESS. After that, the BESS discharges during times when electricity prices are expensive and peak loads occur. 5.3.4 IPU-based robust scheduling In IPU-based robust scheduling, the uncertainty element is defined as an uncertainty set that reduces conservativeness by dividing the interval using a probability density function for each time step. In previous study, this uncertainty set is called the IPU set [24]. The uncertainty used in this scheduling is shown in Fig. 11 . In this scheduling, the SAB load uses the same uncertainty set as in robust scheduling, and the PV output uses the IPU set. The results of IPU-based robust scheduling for the previous day are shown in Fig. 12 . Fig. 12(a) shows the operating status of HP water heater. Compared to Fig. 7(a), the conservativeness of the PV output uncertainty has been reduced, so it can be confirmed that one HP is operating at noon on the first day. Fig. 12(b) shows the temperature of water in the tank. As with other scheduling, you can ensure that the water in the tank is heated to meet the target temperature constraints. Fig. 12(c) shows the operating results of the SAB model, and Fig. 12(d) shows the SOC of BESS. Comparing with Fig. 7(c), it can be seen that the PV output has increased. This is because IPU sets reduce conservativeness. Additionally, it can be confirmed that BESS performs charging and discharging at the same time as other schedules. 5.4 Intra-day scheduling In this paper, we compare four case studies regarding intra-day scheduling results. The case study is as follows. Case A In this case, deterministic scheduling is employed for day-ahead scheduling, and the determined power purchase plan is input into the current day's scheduling. Day-ahead scheduling does not account for the effects of uncertainty. In intra-day scheduling, a maximum prediction error of up to 25% can occur. Case B In this case, robust scheduling is implemented for day-ahead scheduling, and the determined power purchase plan is input into intra-day scheduling. Day-ahead scheduling considers the worst-case scenario, setting γ l o a d = γ p v = 1 . In intra-day scheduling, a maximum prediction error of up to 25% can occur. Case C In this case, MPC-based robust scheduling is implemented for day-ahead scheduling, and the determined power purchase plan is input into intra-day scheduling. In day-ahead scheduling, the robust parameters follow equation (29)∼(31), and MPC-based robust scheduling is carried out. In intra-day scheduling, a maximum prediction error of up to 25% can occur. Case D In this case, scheduling using IPU sets is implemented for the day-ahead scheduling, and the determined power purchase plan is input into intra-day scheduling. In day-ahead scheduling, IPU set is constructed using the probability density function of PV output, and the same load uncertainty set as Case B is constructed. In intra-day scheduling, a maximum prediction error of up to 25% can occur. As mentioned above, intra-day scheduling can result in a prediction error of up to 25%. Therefore, the scheduling of controllable loads and the amount of electricity purchased from the power grid are changed to minimize power shortages. Operation cost and CO2 emissions are shown in Table 5 . The SAB scheduling results for intra-day are shown in Fig. 13 . As shown in Fig. 13, in Case A, day-ahead scheduling is performed without considering uncertainty, resulting in power shortages and significant cost increases. In contrast, within Case B, robust scheduling is performed by day-ahead scheduling. Therefore, prediction errors that occur during intra-day scheduling can be accommodated, so there is no power shortage and penalty. In addition, it can be confirmed that in Case C and Case D, as in Case B, there is no power shortage. This means that the MPC-based robust approach and IPU-based robust approach can ensure robustness. From Table 5, when comparing day-ahead scheduling results for Cases B and C, it can be seen that the operation cost of Case C is 10.79% lower than that of operation Case B. This is because by implementing MPC-based robust scheduling developed in this paper, an operating method that is not too conservative has been achieved. Furthermore, when comparing intra-day scheduling for all cases, Case C shows the lowest operation cost. In addition, regarding the operation cost of intra-day scheduling, it can be seen that the operation cost of case C is 15% lower than that of Case B. This is because robust scheduling makes it possible to deal with power shortages and suppress the increase in penalty costs. This can also be seen in Fig. 13(c). Furthermore, compared to Case D, the operating costs of Case C are 8.6% lower for day-ahead scheduling and 8.8% lower for same-day scheduling. From this, it can be said that the method proposed in this paper can demonstrate superior performance than the conservativeness reduction methods of prior research. 5.5 Analysis and comparison of power shortage in each cases In this section, we analyze the robustness by comparing the power shortages that occur in each case. Fig. 14 shows the distribution of power shortages that occur at each time step in each case in 2020, and Table 6 shows the annual power shortage amount in 2020. From Fig. 14(a), it can be seen that when a deterministic model is used for the day-ahead scheduling, many power shortages occur. In particular, it can be seen that the distribution is concentrated during the daytime when PV output is high and at night when SAB's power load is high. From this, it can be said that power shortages are likely to occur when uncertain factors such as PV output and load are at their peak. From Fig. 14(b)∼(d), it can be confirmed that when uncertainty is taken into account in scheduling the day before, power shortages can be suppressed with almost no occurrence. In particular, Case B takes the worst-case uncertainty into account, making it possible to suppress power shortages the most. In Case C, the proposed method, the uncertainty in the morning hours is reduced, so a slight power shortage occurs between 0:00 and 2:00. However, it can be considered to have similar robustness to Case B because there is no power shortage during the daytime or nighttime, when power shortages tend to occur. In Case D, it can be confirmed that there is a slight power shortage during the daytime hours when PV output is high. In addition, the annual power deficit for Case C is smaller than that of Case D. This shows that Case C is a more robust operation method than Case D. Fig. 15 shows the day-to-day amount of power shortage in each case in 2020. From the Fig. 15, we can see that Case A has the least robust operation, with many power shortages. Case B has no power shortages throughout the year, so it can be said to be the most robust operation. It can be seen that in Case C and Case D, there is a slight power shortage in the spring and autumn seasons when PV output is high. This means that if the conservativeness of uncertainty is reduced, the risk of power shortages increases during periods when PV output, which is an uncertain element, is likely to peak. From the above, it can be seen that the proposed method can maintain robustness while reducing the conservativeness of the solution. 5.6 Relationship with other studies In this section, we discuss the relevance of this study to other research. Lin and Li [17] conducted a detailed analysis using the Kaya- LMDI (logarithmic mean divisia index)- SD (system dynamics)- MC (monte carlo simulation) framework to predict carbon emission peaks and explore reduction paths in residential buildings in Fujian Province. They showed that optimizing energy structure and improving energy efficiency can contribute significantly to carbon dioxide emission reduction. They recommended promoting the use of clean energy, introducing energy-efficient building technologies, and improving residential energy management systems to reduce residential CO2 emissions. The energy management optimization strategy for residential buildings in this paper effectively manages and forecasts energy demand through an MPC-based robust approach, improves energy utilization efficiency, and reduces unnecessary energy consumption, thereby achieving a contribution to CO2 emission reduction and realizing the recommendations stated by Lin and Li [17]. Li et al. [16] analyzed the main driving factors of carbon emissions and predicted and analyzed future carbon emission scenarios with the aim of reducing carbon emissions and achieving carbon neutrality in Fujian Province as a climate change countermeasure. They used the STIRPAT (stochastic impacts by regression on population, affluence, and technology) model to analyze the impacts of population, economic activity, and technology, and further used the SD model to evaluate the dynamic mechanism and feedback structure of the carbon emission system. In particular, it shows that industrial structure has a significant impact on carbon emissions, with a 1% increase leading to a 1.24% increase in emissions. Analysis of policy scenarios identified the optimal carbon emission reduction path and showed the possibility of peaking in 2028. In the residential sector, improving energy efficiency and transforming the structure are also important. This study, which optimizes energy management in apartment buildings, has achieved high efficiency in energy use and promoted the use of clean energy, which can fully contribute to the carbon reduction goals stated by Li et al. [16]. Li et al. [15] identified the spatial distribution and main drivers of carbon emissions in residential buildings in Fuzhou City, Fujian Province, China, and proposed measures to reduce energy consumption and related carbon emissions. They collected data from 2011 to 2021, visualized the spatial patterns of carbon emissions using ArcGIS software, and used the STIRPAT (stochastic impacts by regression on population, affluence, and technology) model to identify that GDP per person, urbanization rate, and resident population are the main drivers of carbon emissions. This led them to recommend that residential buildings promote low-carbon lifestyles, promote the use of energy-efficient home appliances, and encourage residents to change their energy consumption behavior. The residential energy management in this study, which introduces highly efficient HPs and clean energy PV, and uses TOU price and BESS to achieve peak load shifting, has realized the recommendations made by Li et al. [15]. From the above, it can be seen that the energy management in this study meets the recommended requirements for low-carbon housing presented in the studies mentioned above, and can contribute significantly to carbon neutrality. 6 Conclusion In this study, we presented new robust parameters to the smart apartment building model to account for uncertainties and implemented robust optimization. The optimization strategy consists of two stages. In the first stage, day-ahead scheduling is determined by employing deterministic scheduling, robust scheduling, and MPC-based robust scheduling. Subsequently, in the second stage, prediction errors are introduced to determine intra-day scheduling. The power purchase plan established in day-ahead scheduling is input into the second stage, and the operational strategy is adjusted to minimize power shortages during intra-day scheduling. Consequently, within Case A, where the deterministic method is used in day-ahead scheduling, power shortages occur, leading to an increase in operation cost due to added penalty cost. In Case B, considering the worst-case scenario in day-ahead scheduling helped restrain the increase in the operation cost. In Case C, robust optimization is conducted using the MPC-based robust approach developed in this study, resulting in a reduction in the conservativeness of the solution while simultaneously maintaining robustness. Moreover, Case C exhibits superior economic performance in comparison to Case D, which employs the conservatism reduction methodology previously utilized in the study. Additionally, Case C exhibits minimal disparity from Case B in terms of annual power shortage, suggesting that Case C possesses comparable robustness to that of the worst-case scenario. From the aforementioned observations, it can be concluded that the proposed method is capable of maintaining robustness while reducing the conservatism of the solution.

        "dc:description": "Undergoing a significant transition is demand-side management (DSM), brought about by changes in the energy landscape, including the extensive deployment of renewable energy sources (RES). One of the most important challenges in DSM is dealing with uncertainty. Robust optimization methods are widely known as an approach to deal with uncertainty. However, this method tends to be conservative in its solution because it considers worst-case scenarios. In this study, we develop a robust approach of model predictive control (MPC) to reduce conservativeness and maintain robustness in DSM of smart apartment building (SAB). Consisting of two stages is the robust optimization strategy employed in this study. The first stage involves day-ahead scheduling, where four different optimization approaches are implemented. In the second stage, intra-day scheduling is implemented on the basis of day-ahead operational plan. The application of this technique achieves reduced conservativeness and maintains robustness. The simulation results show that by using the proposed approach, compared to conventional robust optimization, while maintaining robustness, the operation cost of day-ahead scheduling can be reduced by 10.79% and the operation cost of intra-day scheduling can be reduced by 15%.",
