Graphical abstract Occupants\u2019 behavior is a major source of uncertainty for the optimal operation of building energy systems. The highly stochastic hot water use behavior of occupants has led to conservative operational strategies for hot water systems, that try to ensure occupants\u2019 comfort by following energy-intensive operational approaches. Intending to integrate the occupants\u2019 behavior into hot water systems control, this study proposes a control framework based on Reinforcement Learning, which can learn the stochastic occupants' behavior and make a balance between opposing objectives of water hygiene, comfort, and energy use. A model-free approach is implemented to ensure transferability. To achieve fast convergence on the target house while being model-free, this study proposes an offline training procedure integrating a stochastic hot water use model to mimic the hot water use behavior of occupants. The proposed framework is then evaluated using an actual hot water use and weather dataset collected over 29 weeks from a residential house in Switzerland. The performance of the proposed control framework is compared to the conventional rule-based controller as the common practice in hot water systems. While the hot water use dataset has been collected during the COVID-19 pandemic, with an abnormal schedule of occupants, results indicate that the proposed control framework could successfully learn and adapt to the occupants' behavior and achieve 23.8% of energy saving, while maintaining the occupants' comfort and water hygiene. The adaptive nature of the proposed control framework shows significant potential in reducing the discrepancy between supply and demand in hot water systems.

Consequently, the share of hot water energy demand in the total heat requirement can be up to 70% in modern low energy rated buildings [2]. The hot water systems not only account for an increasing share in building energy demand, but also they can provide several other potentials to the building energy system, such as renewable energy integration [3,4], demand response scenarios [5], and load shifting [6]. Thus, hot water systems are increasingly becoming a vital factor for efficient energy management in buildings. Hot water requirement in households is strongly correlated with occupants\u2019 behavior [7], which is highly stochastic, differs from building to building, and varies over time in the same building [8,9]. Consequently, the highly stochastic nature of hot water use behavior is the major challenge for developing energy-efficient control methods for hot water systems. Due to this challenge, conventional control methods follow a cautious approach to make sure enough hot water is available whenever it is required. The most conventional control method for hot water systems is rule-based control, also known as two-point control, in which the hot water system is switched ON when the tank temperature is below a lower threshold (usually 65 °C) and is switched OFF when the tank temperature is above a higher threshold (usually 75 °C) [8,9]. Although it is a simple and easy-to-use controller, it is very static, detached from the occupants\u2019 behavior, and therefore energy-intensive by over-preparing hot water. A more advanced control method is the Model-Predictive Control (MPC) in which the predictions of stochastic phenomena such as renewable energy availability and environmental conditions can be used for the optimal schedule of energy systems in the built environment [10]. Predictions of occupants\u2019 behavior can also be integrated as another stochastic phenomenon in the MPC control framework. However, as there is no physical model for occupants\u2019 behavior, either stochastic models or data-driven models should be used. Stochastic models are usually developed based on the data of several buildings of a specific type and, therefore, follow a typical routine of hot water use in those buildings [11]. However, the hot water use behavior of one building can be very different from another building of the same type and topography. Besides, the hot water use behavior of occupants can deviate from the predicted routine if it changes over time, for example, by the change in occupancy due to special situations such as COVID19-imposed home office working. On the other hand, data-driven models are usually based on supervised learning, which can learn the hot water use behavior of a specific building by using data collected from the same building to predict the future demand [9]. However, implementation of a data-driven model into MPC requires enough historical data of hot water demand to train the model, limiting its application to the buildings with an existing dataset. In addition to the difficulties to predict occupants\u2019 behavior, MPC requires an accurate model of the system, which is time-consuming to develop and needs to be updated (tuned) for every other system with different parameters [12]. Furthermore, an initially accurately developed model could become fairly inaccurate over time due to the aging or renovation of the water heating system, and subsequently sub-optimal policies would continue to be executed because of the obsolete dynamic model [13]. Given the importance of occupants' behavior in the energy use of buildings, an ideal control system should be able to integrate the stochastic occupants' behavior into the control loop [14]. With recent advances in the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies (cheap sensors and microelectronic boards, efficient online platforms, etc.) on the one hand and vast progress in Machine Learning methods, on the other hand, the implementation of new control systems utilizing occupants-related data looks ever more realistic now. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has recently gained increasing interest as a data-driven control method for the built environment, as it can continuously adapt to the stochastic occupants' behavior, the time-varying environmental conditions, and system aging with no need for a rigorous mathematical representation of the system [15]. RL provides several advantages over optimization-based methods such as MPC. RL requires very little effort to be implemented on complex systems, because only the number of states to be included should be increased, but in an optimization-based method, the complexity of the model increases significantly. Once trained, RL is very computationally effective and can be implemented on low-cost hardware, but optimization-based methods are very computationally expensive. If the RL is trained continuously, which is when it has the highest potential of adaptation, it can learn and adapt to the changes in the system (such as the renovation of the system), while optimization-based methods continue to run non-optimal actions unless their model is manually modified. As the application of RL in buildings is relatively new, with a limited experience on filed implementations, it has still some limitations compared to the older methods, such as optimization-based models, that should be addressed in research. RL algorithms are not yet data-efficient and can take a long time to converge to an optimal scenario. Also, in RL, the agent requires to perform random actions to explore the environment; therefore, it can perform inefficient or even system damaging actions. Until new algorithms are developed for solving these drawbacks, pre-training the agent using a virtual environment prior to be implemented in practice can help to reduce these drawbacks in the current algorithms. RL potential has been demonstrated for various applications in the built environment, such as optimal control of space heating and cooling [16], lighting [17], windows [18], air handling units [19], solar energy integration [20] and water heating systems [13]. A very common application of RL in the built environment is to optimize the control of indoor air temperature using a variety of different space heating and cooling systems. In these studies, the agent usually tries to balance the energy consumption and occupants\u2019 comfort. Brandi et al. [21] proposed a double deep Q-learning framework for optimal control of indoor air temperature using a water-based space heating system in an office building. In this study, two important aspects of RL are discussed in detail, which are the design of state-space, and the comparison of static versus dynamic deployment. In the static deployment, the learning process of the agent only happens during the training phase, while in the dynamic deployment, the agent is still learning during the deployment phase. While the dynamic approach may enhance the performance, it requires more computational resources. Zou et al. [19] developed an RL framework for optimal control of air handling units. The agent tries to minimize the energy consumption while preserving the comfort of occupants quantified using Predicted Percentage of Discomfort (PPD). To model the system to be controlled, Neural Network models of air handing units were developed using 2 years of operational data recorded by the building automation system. Since the application of RL for occupant-centric control has been mostly focused on indoor air temperature and, consequently, space heating and cooling systems, and there has been little focus on the other domains of occupant-building interaction. Park et al [17] investigated the application of RL for occupant-centric control of lights in offices; the agent tried to balance visual comfort and energy consumption. A device called Lightlearn was specifically developed for the experiments to allow both manual and automatic switching of lights, which, therefore, can monitor the interactions of occupants over the learning phase. Han et al. [18] proposed an RL framework to optimize the time point for window opening/closing; the agent, in this case, tried to make a balance between thermal comfort and indoor air quality. Performed literature review shows that very few researchers have addressed the application of RL in hot water systems. Kazmi et al. [13] proposed a model-based RL control framework to balance comfort and energy use in heat pump water heating systems. In particular, they used a model-based heuristic method that incorporates the storage tank state and occupant hot water use behavior into the optimal control problem. The models for heat pump, storage tank, and occupants\u2019 behavior prediction are probabilistic data-driven models that are trained with historical data. In another study, Kazmi and Ali [20] proposed an RL framework based on deep Q-learning for optimal operation of photovoltaic-assisted domestic hot water production systems. The proposed framework tried to maximize the self-consumption of photovoltaic panels by shifting the consumption into the period of production. Correa-Jullian et al. [22] evaluated the application of tabular Q-learning for the optimal operation of a heat pump water heater integrated with the solar thermal panels and heat recovery chiller. The proposed framework tried to determine the operational schedules of the solar field and heat recovery chiller to make a balance between energy efficiency and comfort indicators. Table 1 presents a summary of the above-mentioned and few other studies that have investigated the application of RL on different aspects of the built environment. This literature review on the application of RL in water heating systems identified the following limitations: \u2022 Model-based: Most of the studies have relied on the modeling of the system and predictions of occupants\u2019 behavior. Although modeling of the system increases the data efficiency as the agent does not need to learn the system model from scratch, it reduces the transferability of the control framework to the other buildings, poses a risk of model inaccuracy and predictions error, and significantly increases the computational load [29]. \u2022 Hygiene aspect: The risk of Legionella growth is not integrated into any of the proposed frameworks, while it is an essential issue to be considered in the optimal operation of hot water systems. Energy-saving efforts of lowering hot water temperature can result in a higher risk of Legionella. For instance, the increasing number of Legionella infection cases in Switzerland has elaborated the Legionella control efforts [30]. Subsequently, ignorance of this aspect will limit the widespread implementation of a control framework that does not consider the hygiene issue \u2022 Direct implementation on the target building: At the beginning of the learning phase, the agent does not have enough experience with its environment, therefore it can perform non-optimal actions that may result in user dissatisfaction. The previous studies, however, have directly started the learning process on the target houses. The highly adaptive nature of RL makes it a great choice for hot water systems where the occupants\u2019 behavior plays a vital role. Currently, there is limited knowledge and practice on the use of RL-based controls for hot water systems. The aim of this research is, therefore, to fill the knowledge gap by developing an RL controls framework with the following main features: \u2022 Model-free: It does not require a complex thermodynamic model to represent the actual system, rather it learns the system and occupants' behavior through the interactions with the environment. Therefore, the controller can be implemented to the systems with no prior knowledge of affecting parameters such as heat pump capacity, tank size, efficiency, number of occupants, etc. This feature improves the transferability of the proposed framework to different buildings. \u2022 Offline training: A drawback of the model-free approach is a long learning period as the control framework needs to learn the models from scratch. To reduce the learning period without relying on any model, this framework includes an offline training stage, where an agent gains prior knowledge before online implementation on a target building. Over the offline training, a stochastic model is integrated into the framework to simulate the occupants' hot water use behavior. The offline-training is inspired by a relatively new research area called Transfer Learning, in which the agent aims to improve the learning task in a target domain using the knowledge from other domains [31]. \u2022 Hygiene supervision: The hygiene aspect of the hot water tank is also included in the framework to make sure that energy-saving efforts by the agent do not increase the risk of Legionella growth. The agent, therefore, tries to regularly overheat the tank, and properly match the schedule of overheating to the demand profile to eliminate the bacterial growth in the tank while saving energy. \u2022 Double deep Q-learning: All the reviewed papers on hot water systems with model-free methods either have implemented tabular or deep Q-network. They are also the most commonly used methods for other thermal systems as indicated in Table 1. However, it is known that both of tabular and deep Q-network can overestimate the value of an action and, therefore, continue to generate a non-optimal policy. The proposed framework in this research is based on double deep Q-learning, which is known to solve the issue of overestimation [32]. This research, therefore, addressed a novel research topic on occupant behavior-centric building design and operation, which is the focus of a current research project of the international energy agency (IEA-EBC Annex 79) [14]. The remaining parts of the paper are organized into 4 sections: Section 2 describes the methodology, Section 3 discusses the results, Section 4 provides suggestions for future research and Section 5 concludes the paper. 2 Methodology Reinforcement Learning (RL) is an interaction-based machine learning process in which an agent learns to perform an optimal action in a specific state to minimize a given reward function over time. Through interaction with the environment and learning from mistakes, the agent becomes increasingly more intelligent at decision-making under uncertainty. As shown in Fig. 1 , at each time t, the agent receives the current state of the environment ( S t ), then chooses an action ( A t ) from a set of possible actions. Caused by this action, the environment moves to a new state ( S t + 1 ), and the agent receives a reward ( R t + 1 ) that qualifies the performed action. This transition experience ( S t , A t , S t + 1 , R t + 1 ) is then stored as a single experience to train the agent. The goal of an RL agent is to maximize the sum of the discounted future rewards, known as the return function defined as Equation (1). The RL agent not only takes into account the immediate effect of performing an action but also considers the discounted future impact of the action. This feature makes it suitable for thermal systems with a slow response time due to their thermal inertia. (1) R = ∑ t = 0 ∞ γ t R t The most common method of RL is deep Q-learning [17] in which a neural network takes the state of the environment as an input and provides the value of performing each of the predefined actions as an output. In the conventional deep Q-learning method, the action value is calculated based on Equation (2): (2) Q S t , A t = R t + 1 + γ m a x A Q ( S t + 1 , A ) in which Q S t , A t is the estimated value for the pair of S t and A t , R t + 1 is the immediate reward, γ is the discount factor and Q ( S t + 1 , A t ) is the estimated maximum value for the next state which shows how good is the next state. Therefore, in this method, estimating the value of performing an action in the current state relies on estimating the next state value by the same network. It is indicated that this initial estimation of Q-value can result in an overestimation and selecting non-optimal actions by DQN. To solve this issue and also provide better stability over the training phase, in 2015 Hasselt et al. [33] proposed Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN). In DDQN, the term Q ( S t + 1 , A ) in Equation (2) is selected by another neural network (called Target network) where the parameters are updated based on the main network but with less frequency. Since the DDQN method solves the problem of overestimation by conventional DQN, the control framework is developed based on the DDQN method in this work. 2.1 Layout of hot water system and required sensors The hot water system in this study is an air-source heat pump connected to the hot water tank, as shown in Fig. 2 . This example system well represents the challenges of optimal control in hot water systems, because the heat pump COP is affected by outdoor air temperature, stochasticity of hot water demand affects the tank temperature, and the issue of Legionella should be considered as a water tank is included. The agent should receive certain data from the system at each time step to extract the required states and calculate the reward. To implement the proposed control framework in practice, a set of sensors should be installed on the heat pump, as shown in Fig. 2. An important consideration in developing the proposed framework is to rely on the minimum required number of sensors, which in turn increases the economic feasibility of this solution and reduces the probability of malfunctioning due to a fault of sensors. Only four sensors are required to implement the proposed framework, including an air temperature sensor on the evaporator to measure the temperature of evaporator inlet air, a power meter to measure power use of the heat pump, a water flow sensor at the tank outlet to monitor hot water use behavior, and a temperature sensor at the middle of the tank to monitor tank temperature. The use of the temperature sensor in the middle of the tank is a cautious approach to ensure the occupants' comfort; the comfort temperature of 40 °C is considered as water temperature limit for the middle part of the tank, while water at the outlet is always at a higher temperature due to the stratification in the hot water tank. It is assumed that this difference will compensate the temperature drop over the piping. The air temperature sensor should always measure the air temperature of the air that evaporator is exposed to, so if the evaporator is indoor the air temperature sensor will be also located indoor. In this study, the power and tank temperature sensors are considered in the energy model of the system implemented in TRNSYS. The provided air temperature data by Agroscope, a competence center for agricultural research in Switzerland [34], is also used in the TRNSYS model as the air temperature sensor data. Data on the flow rate of water is generated using a stochastic model on the occupants' hot water behavior [11] during the offline training phase, and using measured data from the case study building during the online training phase. The data collection layout to monitor the hot water use behavior of occupants is presented in the case study section. In a constant volume hot water tank, the amount of hot water exited from outlet is replaced by inlet cold water at the tank bottom. The hot water demand data at each timestep is given to the hot water tank model of TRNSYS, which enables the calculation to tank temperature for that timestep. 2.2 State, action, and reward design Proper setup and sufficient training are two key factors to obtain a good performance in RL. The state vector should provide enough information from the environment to the agent, and a reward function should be adequately formulated to reach the desired balance between the contrasting objectives when it is minimized. While the state vector should include enough information, a high dimensional vector should also be avoided as it can increase the error and computational time. Fig. 3 shows how the state and action are designed at each time step. In this figure, the first diagram shows the selected action for the upcoming hour. Second, third and fourth diagrams respectively show the previous hours of demand interval, outdoor air temperature and tank temperature. The two last diagrams show the hour of the day, and the day of the week for the upcoming hour. State: At each time step (indicated by the \u201ccurrent time\u201d in Fig. 3) the state vector includes the following elements: \u2022 M previous hours of demand intervals: The agent needs to learn the hot water use behavior of the occupants and explicitly predict the future behavior to make the right decision prior to the demand and ensure the occupants' comfort. Several studies have shown that an array with a sequence of previous demands is the best feature for predicting future demands [4,9,35,36]. To include the previous demands in the state vector, the demand data is converted into the demand intervals of 5 L (e.g., a demand of 3 L is in the first interval and therefore would be 1). While the effect of demands within the same interval on the tank temperature is almost the same, categorizing the continuous demand data into intervals makes it easier for the agent to learn the demand pattern. An array including the demand intervals over the M previous hours is included in the state vector. A sensitivity analysis is done to select an adequate length of the M array; \u2022 N previous hours of ambient temperature: As the outside air temperature affects the heat pump Coefficient of Performance (COP), the agent should be able to learn the outdoor air temperature and shift the heating schedules as much as possible to the hours with higher temperatures. Similarly, N previous hours of the outdoor air temperature are also included in the state vector to enable the agent to predict future variations; \u2022 Storage tank temperature T s t o r a g e : The average tank temperature during the last hour is also included in the state vector so the agent can observe how much energy is already stored in the tank; \u2022 Hour of the day: Since the hot water use behavior is highly correlated with the time of the day [4,9,35,36], to further assist the agent to predict the upcoming hot water demand, the upcoming hour (for which the decision is going to be taken) as an integer between 0 and 23 is included in the state; \u2022 Type of the day of the week: The hot water use behavior during the weekdays can be similar and different from the weekends [9,35]. Therefore, the differentiation between the days of the week is included in the states as 1 (for workdays) and 0 (for weekends). Action: The decision to be taken by the agent is whether to turn ON or OFF the heat pump over the upcoming hour. Reward: The reward function is defined in Equation (3), which includes the competing terms multiplied by coefficients to weigh the importance of each term. IfDemand > 0 : R = - a × P hp - b × max 40 - T tank , 0 - c × m a x ( Hours fromoverheat - 24 , 0 ) IfDemand = 0 : (3) R = - a × P hp - c × m a x ( Hours fromoverheat - 24 , 0 ) In this equation, P hp is the electricity consumption of the heat pump (kWh), T tank is the storage tank temperature (°C), and Hours fromoverheat is the total number of hours from the last time when the tank was heated above 60 °C. The first term is called the Energy term, which gives a negative reward to the agent proportional to the energy consumption. The second term is called the Comfort term. The temperature of 40 °C is known as the highest temperature that occupants may request after mixing cold and hot water at the end uses [8,37,38]. As the desired temperature differs for each fixture and can vary over time [39], we considered 40 °C as a lower limit that can satisfy all the type of demands and any demand which is supplied by a lower temperature should be punished. It should be considered that the lower limit of 40 °C is considered for the middle of that tank, while due to the stratification, the temperature at the top part of the tank and, therefore, outlet is always higher. It is assumed that this temperature difference would compensate the temperature drop along the water pipeline. The second term, therefore, gives a negative reward to the agent if water is supplied at a temperature lower than 40 °C. As shown in Equation (3), when there is no demand, this term is excluded from the reward to allow the agent to save energy by lowering the tank temperature when there is no demand predicated over a long time. For example, if occupants leave their home for a week, the agent then can lower the tank temperature and only heat the tank periodically for sterilization. The third term, called the Hygiene term, is a health-related term to make sure that the agent is aware of the risk of Legionella growth in the tank and, therefore, sterilizes the tank whenever it is needed. This term is based on the recommendation to keep water in the tank at least once a day at 60 °C for 11 min to sterilize the bacteria [8,40]. Kenhove et al. [41] developed a Coupled thermohydraulic and biologic model to quantify the concentration of Legionella in the hot water system and integrated the model into a rule-based controller to sterilize the tank when the concentration of Legionella bacteria in the tank is expected to be higher than a threshold. The resulted heating schedule showed that the tank was heated above 60 °C once a day, which confirms the validity of the recommendation in [8,40]. To include the overheating rule in the reward function, the hygiene term counts the number of hours from the last overheat and gives a negative reward, proportional to the hours passed if the number of hours is more than 24. Therefore, the agent needs to overheat the tank once a day to keep this term zero. The coefficients a, b and c adjust the relative importance of each term. 2.3 Training and deployment The proposed framework unfolds over three sequential stages, as shown in Fig. 4 . \u2022 Offline training: This stage aims to provide prior experience to the agent in the lab in a virtual environment (offline) before being trained on the target building (online). This stage is considered due to two main reasons: first and foremost, once the agent gains prior experience with similar data, it will converge faster to the optimal operation policy on the target building; secondly, it will reduce the probability of disturbing occupants\u2019 comfort over the training phase. The RL agent during the training should be able to directly interact with the environment and learn the optimal behavior over the interactions. To provide these interactions, the transient model of an air-source heat pump connected to a storage tank is developed in TRNSYS. The agent model developed in Python (Tensorforce library) can send actions to the TRNSYS model and receive back the next state and calculate the reward function accordingly. Details of the agent-environment interaction are discussed in the next sections. To simulate the environment, hot water demand data and outdoor air temperature should also be provided to the TRNSYS model of an air source heat pump. The hot water use profile in the offline phase is based on a recent stochastic hot water use model developed by Ritchie et al. [12]. This stochastic model is developed based on actual measurements of hot water usage from 77 households in South Africa. The measurements have been before the COVID-19 pandemic, therefore representing the normal behavior of hot water usage in residential buildings. This model is used to generate 6 years of hourly hot water use data for offline train phase. \u2022 It was reported that the simulated hot water profiles closely match the actual measurements and were representative enough to be used for modeling the hot water use behavior in residential households [11]. Considering that the stochastic model is based on the data measured on 77 households, the 6 years of generated data, therefore, includes a good variety of occupants\u2019 behavior over residential buildings. The outdoor air temperature data is provided by Agroscope. To improve the generalization potential of the framework over Switzerland, for each year of the offline training, the outdoor air temperature of a different city is supplied to the TRNSYS model. Accordingly, six different Swiss cities are selected as shown in Fig. 5 . Cities are selected from the north, south, east, west, and center of the county to ensure that the agent gains experience with different climatic conditions of the country and can adapt quickly when implemented across Switzerland. \u2022 Online training: After gaining prior knowledge, the agent needs to learn the specific system characteristics and occupants' behavior in the target building. Accordingly, an online training period on the target building is necessary to obtain an optimal control performance. Twenty-seven weeks are considered for the online training to ensure that the agent will have enough time to adapt to the target household. Shorter periods of training can also be considered for active learning in online mode, but it would require a subscription for online data streaming via cloud services. Since the goal of this work is to train an agent capable of performing properly offline, once implemented on the control board, a sufficient training period will ensure enough experience with understanding occupants\u2019 behavior. The target system is modeled in TRNSYS to enable the interactions with the agent, similar to the offline training. However, it should be noted that the role of the TRNSYS model in this stage is different from the offline training. In this stage, the TRNSYS model represents the target system, while in the offline training, the TRNSYS model is part of the framework to train the model before being implemented on the target system. Therefore, the parameters of the model used in this stage are different from the offline training. To represent the actual hot water use behavior of occupants, the demand data at this stage is based on the experimental measurements from the target house, as described in the case study section. \u2022 Deployment: Over the training stages, the agent is both controlling the system and improving itself by learning from its mistakes. Over the deployment stage, however, the agent is no longer learning but only controlling the system. The deployment stage needs much less computational power; therefore, the agent can be implemented on an inexpensive single-board computer (such as a Raspberry pi) embedded in the heat pump. While during the deployment phase also the agent could continue learning and updating control policy, it would need enough computational power and should be done on a server. To make a balance between the computational effectiveness and the policy update, the offline and online train phases are designed to provide enough experience for the agent and no learning is considered for the deployment phase. To test the performance of the proposed framework, two weeks of deployment is considered in this study using the actual data of hot water demand and outdoor air temperature of the target house. Therefore, the hot water use data of the online train and deployment phases has been during the COVID-19 pandemic. In summary, the offline training is done virtually, but online training and deployment need to be done on the target house. In this research, to simulate the actual implementation on the target house, recorded data of their hot water use behavior is used in a dynamic TRNSYS simulation. 2.4 Agent setup The agent model is developed in Python based on the Tensorforce library [42], which provides very customizable classes for modeling the agent and environment. Table 2 shows the selected hyper-parameters after tuning. One of the important aspects of training an RL framework is the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. To maximize the rewards, the agent should select actions previously experienced and leading to a higher reward in that state, which is called exploitation. On the other hand, it is desired that the agent also performs the actions that have not been experienced before in that state, which is called exploration. One of the well-known methods to balance the exploration/exploitation trade-off is the ε - g r e e d y method, in which a small probability of ε is specified and agent performs exploration when a random number would be higher than ε . In this study, it is desired that the agent only performs exploitation at the beginning of training because the execution of random actions can disturb the occupants and reduce their satisfaction. Therefore, a linear decay is established for exploration, where the ε linearly decays from 0.9 to 0.001 at each time step over the first two weeks. The update frequency is set as 12 h, so the agent updates its policy two times a day. The memory size is also considered as 20 weeks to remember the long-term occupants' behavior. It means that the data from 20 weeks of previous interactions between agent and environment (in case of the state, action, reward, and next state) is stored in a memory, and at each time step of training, the agent selects a batch from is a memory to update its policy. The learning rate, batch size, and update frequency are selected by running the agent for the first 10 weeks of offline training and observing the results. 2.5 Environment setup An air-source heat pump connected to a storage tank is simulated in TRNSYS to represent the environment. While the hot water use data are experimentally measured from the case study building to represent the actual behavior of occupants, due to the lack of required information about the sizes, the simulated system is not based on the actual system of the building. The heat pump evaporator in the simulated model is assumed to be outdoor, to explore the agent adaptability to a more complicated case where the COP varies with the outdoor air temperature. The proposed framework can also be used for a heat pump with an indoor evaporator, which would be easier for the agent to control because the indoor air temperature has much lower variations than the outdoor air temperature. The sizes of the system used in offline and online training are different. This is because in practice a model with the same configuration but with typical sizes can be used to train the agent offline. While the agent was trained offline, it should be able to be implemented on any target system with the same configuration but with different sizes. It will significantly facilitate the transferability of the trained agent to other buildings. Therefore, as indicated on Fig. 4, Model 1 is used for offline training and Model 2 is used in online and deployment phases to represent the actual system. Type 938 and Type 534 of TRNSYS components are used to model the heat pump and storage tank, respectively. Parameters used in each of the models are listed in Table 3 . 2.6 Agent-Environment interaction At each time step, the agent should be able to perform an action on the simulated air-source heat pump and receive back the next state to calculate the reward. A Python function is developed to make it possible, which can run the TRNSYS simulations from Python using the desired parameters. This function makes it very easy to automate repetitive simulations. As illustrated in Fig. 6 , at the first time step, the interactions start with the \u201cReset ()\u201d function that outputs a pre-defined initial state to start the process. Based on the given state, the agent selects an action and performs it on the TRNSYS model. This is equal to one step forward over time, so the outdoor air temperature and hot water demand associated with that specific hour are also imported in the TRNSYS model. The TRNSYS simulation is performed for a time-step of one hour, where the resulting state parameters, as well as the additional parameters required for calculating the reward (such as the power use over the last hour), are calculated by TRNSYS. If the episode is not ended, this state is given to the agent to choose the following action. The episode length is set as 168 h (1 week) to cover the weekly behavior of occupants over each episode. 2.7 Baseline controller The performance of the proposed framework is compared to a two-point controller, which is the most common control approach for with-tank water heating systems. The two-point controller, with the set-points selected based on the common practice [8], turns ON the heat pump when the tank temperature falls below 65 °C and turns it OFF when the tank temperature exceeds 75 °C. It should be noted that the demanded water flow at a specific temperature at the end-use is achieved by mixing hot and cold water streams. Consequently, if the supplied temperature of hot water increases, a lower flow rate of the hot stream with a higher flow rate of the cold stream is mixed to reach the same desired flow rate and temperature after mixing. To address this point and ensure a fair comparison between the proposed framework and the baseline controller, it is assumed that both cases need to provide the same flow rate after mixing, with the same desired temperature of 40 °C. Considering the cold water temperature of 10 °C, the required flow rate of hot water to produce the desired water flow at 40 °C after mixing is calculated at each time step based on the supply temperature of hot water, and this flow rate is what should be provided by each system. 2.8 Case study description To monitor the actual hot water use behavior of occupants, a detached residential building in Switzerland is selected as the case study. The family living in this house is composed of two adults and three children. The hot water demand of this family is monitored for 29 weeks, from 28 August 2020 until 19 March 2021. The monitoring campaign is, therefore, coincident with the COVID-19 pandemic timing. Consequently, occupants' schedule and hot water use behavior have been different from the typical weeks before mid-March\u20192020. To further evaluate how the occupancy schedule and hot water use behavior have been changed over the pandemic, survey responses about the occupancy are collected at the end of the monitoring campaign. The stochastic hot water demand model used in the offline train phase is based on collected hot water demand data in other residential buildings before the COVID-19 pandemic, but the monitoring campaign and, therefore, the data used for online training and deployment phases in this study has been during the pandemic. While there is no data collected before the pandemic in the case study, the survey results can highlight the change of occupants' schedule and behavior during the pandemic. 2.9 Monitoring campaign In this research, due to the future steps of this project, a comprehensive monitoring layout is implemented to monitor the hot and cold water usage at each of the end-uses, such as shower, faucet, etc. It should be noted that to implement the proposed control framework, the hot water use behavior can be monitored using a single water flow sensor at the tank outlet, as shown in Fig. 2. However, the monitoring campaign of this research is explained in detail, because after trying a few other methods, this method was found as a robust solution for long-time and high-resolution monitoring of hot water demand. Therefore, the detailed description of the monitoring campaign can provide an insight for researchers willing to study hot water use behavior at the end-use level. There are particular challenges with this kind of monitoring layout. First of all, sensors should continuously work for several months while there is no plug available near to most of the end uses, and wiring in some places, especially in the shower, is not easy. Secondly, long-term data storage using locally placed data loggers is expensive. Finally, a sensor placed in the shower needs to be water-resistant (withstand high humidity and water splashes). To address all these challenges, an IoT monitoring campaign was implemented with close collaboration with Droople company, a startup company in Switzerland [43]. Fig. 7 shows the data streaming architecture of the IoT sensors used in this research. A compact and cost-effective hall-effect flow sensor is used to measure the flow and send pulses to the hardware, called iLink. iLink is a board with a waterproof casing that works based on the LoRaWAN, a low-power and wide area network designed to connect battery-operated IoT nodes wirelessly. This allows the iLink modules to monitor the hot water use behavior for several months operating with a small battery. The data are then sent to the gateway, which acts as a bridge between the LoRaWAN and WiFi networks. The gateway connected to a power plug sends data to the cloud server for storing and monitoring in real-time. Fig. 8 shows two examples of the installation of the sensors at the end uses. In total 11 sensors are installed, including one pair under the kitchen sink, 4 pairs under 4 faucets, and 1 in the shower. 3 Results and discussion This section firstly discusses a primary analysis of the hot water use behavior during the monitoring campaign, and sensitivity analysis of the framework parameters to select the best configuration for the framework afterward. Finally, the detailed performance results of the selected scenario are presented. 3.1 Survey results This section presents the results of occupant surveys, which provide valuable information about the changes of occupants\u2019 behavior before and during COVID-19 in this case study. Typical daily presence of occupants before and during the COVID-19 pandemic is shown in Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 , respectively. The children stay in their parents\u2019 house for some weeks and most of the weeks they are away from home studying abroad. So, the daily schedule of children is only for the days that they stay in their parents\u2019 house. As can be seen in Fig. 9, before the COVID-19 pandemic, most of the occupants used to leave home around 8 A.M. and come back around 6P.M., which follows a typical occupancy pattern expected for a residential building. On the weekends, the occupants typically used to stay at home. However, as shown in Fig. 10, during the COVID-19 pandemic and, therefore, during the monitoring weeks, all the occupants used to work from home. This will change the routine of hot water demand expected for a residential building and can significantly increase the stochasticity of hot water demand, for example, the occupants are more flexible with showering time than before. Fig. 11 shows the presence of occupants over different weeks of study. One of the children was present only one week and the other one only 8 weeks during the 29 weeks of the monitoring campaign. This is another aspect that increases the stochasticity of demand in the case study as the number of occupants varied between 3and 5. In the survey, a question was also asked about whether the occupants\u2019 hot water use habits have changed during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the normal or not. The occupants' feedback shows that their usage of kitchen and toilet faucets is increased both in frequency and duration. Their showering frequency is reported to be the same as before, while its duration is reported to be longer. Therefore, both the stochasticity and amount of hot water use during the pandemic have been different from the normal periods, making it harder for the agent to learn and predict the occupants' behavior. The outdoor air temperature of this case study is also obtained from a weather station of Agroscope located about 200 m away from the building. 3.2 Evaluation of hot water use behavior of occupants during COVID-19 pandemic A better understanding of the routines in hot water use behavior helps properly design the control framework, particularly to define the number of previous demands to be considered in the state vector. Previous studies have used statistical methods to recognize the existing routines in hot water use behavior in residential buildings [9,35,36], and they have been consistent in reporting that hot water use pattern is similar between the weekdays and different from the weekends. However, in this study, the monitoring has taken place during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the occupants\u2019 schedule and habits have been different from the \u201cnormal\u201d behavior. Therefore, in this section, the recorded hot water use data are analyzed to better understand the occupants\u2019 behavior and the difference between the pandemic period and the prior (normal) period described in the previous studies. Fig. 12 shows the boxplots of hot water demand indicating how demand is distributed over the weekdays and the day hours. The average values over different days of the week are very similar, mainly because the occupants have always been present at their homes, as shown in Fig. 10. The distribution of demands over the day hours indicates three peaks at 8, 10, and 21o\u2019clock, while previous studies reported two peaks, typically between 6 and 9 and 18\u201322o\u2019clock over the day [9,35]. This is mainly due to showering in the morning and cooking or showering at the night. A third peak in the hourly average hot water demand at 10o\u2019clock can be explained by the flexible schedule of occupants staying at home. To quantify the similarity of the demand patterns between different days in a week, a Pearson correlation analysis is performed, as shown in Fig. 13 (A). Values on this figure show the correlation between the total hot water consumption of different days. Previous studies that used correlation analysis [9,35] have reported that the weekdays have a high correlation between each other and less correlation with the weekends, which consequently have separated the correlation matrix into two sections, weekend days and weekdays. An example of a correlation matrix for data collected during the normal days (before COVID-19 pandemic) reported in [9] is shown in Fig. 13 (B). A comparison between daily correlation before and after COVID-19 reveals how the occupants behavior during COVID-19 has been different from normal days. While Fig. 13 (B) is from another study [9], Fig. 13 (A) is made in a similar way for an easier comparison. The comparison of these figures shows that the occupants\u2019 behavior in our case study household does not follow the same trend as normal days, and there is no longer a strong correlation between the weekdays and weekend days. Due to the particular hot water use-related habits of occupants, hot water demand at a specific hour can be related to the demand of a previous hour. Autocorrelation analysis can quantify this relationship, which can provide further information for sizing the length of prior demands to be used in the state. Fig. 14 shows the Pearson autocorrelation of hot water demand data describing a negative correlation (values [−1;0]) or a positive correlation (values [0;1]). The values on this figure show how the variations of total hot water consumption of each hour is correlated with the other hours of the day. The highest autocorrelation is observed at 168 h and 24-hour time lag, indicating that the demand at a specific hour has the highest relationship with the demand at the same hour a week before and the previous day, respectively. Although the data have been recorded during the COVID-19 pandemic, the highest autocorrelation with the demand of a prior week and a prior day is in line with previous studies reporting pre-pandemic normal situations [9,35]. It can be therefore concluded that although during the pandemic occupants do not follow the normal schedule of residential houses, there is still a repetition in their hot water use behavior similar to the normal situation. We did a double-check of our calculations, and the values are correct. Here we present our calculations in more detail, and further explain why the value of correlation between Demand and Hour of the day is little, and in the manuscript also we briefly point out to the reason to clarify it. The correlation factor in this study is based on Pearson correlation coefficient, with the following definition: r xy = ∑ i = 1 n ( x i - x ¯ ) ( y i - y ¯ ) ∑ i = 1 n ( x i - x ¯ ) 2 ∑ i = 1 n ( y i - y ¯ ) 2 In which, x_i and y_i are the values of each sample, x ̅ and y ̅ are the average values. A correlation close to 1 shows that there is a linear relationship between the values of × and y, so if × increases, y will increase as well. Considering this concept, it is expectable that the correlation between the value of hot water use today at a specific hour with the value of hot water use the same hour of yesterday is high (around 0.3 in our data). This is because there is a routine in occupants behavior, and therefore the value of demand for example at 11 AM of today can be roughly estimated as a linear function of the demand at 11 AM of yesterday. And if the amount of hot water demand at 11 AM is following in ancreasing trend, the amound of demand today at 11 AM is also expected to follow this trend and increase in value. On the other hand, correlation between Demand and Hour of the day shows the correlation between two vectors like Demands = [Demand t=1, Demand t=2,\u2026, Demand t=24] and t = [1,2,..24]. There is no linear relationship between the valus of the two vectors. For example, the value of demand does not necessarily increase with the increase in the value of Hour. Therefore the value of correlation factor between the two vectors is little. RL agent has the ability to learn which features are more important. While the correlation between the values of demand hour vectors is little, hour included in the features beucase in some hours of the day a peak in demand happens, and therefore if the agent knows the hour of the day, it can better learn and predict these peaks. The paragraph explaining this figure is revised as follow to better clarify these explanations: Previous studies have used temporal factors, such as the hour of the day and the day of the week, as important features for supervised learning models to predict hot water demand [9,35,36]. Among the available features, temporal features can be of more importance also for an RL agent. Fig. 15 shows the correlation between the hot water demand pattern and three features available in the dataset. For example, the correlation factor between Demand and Hour shows that how a vector including the hourly hot water demands of a day is correlated with a vector including the hour of the day (e.g. [1,2,3,\u2026,24]). A correlation coefficient close to 1 shows a linear relationship between two variables, and, therefore, that variable can be a valuable input to predict the other. As shown in Fig. 15, hot water demand has a positive correlation with both temporal features of the hour and day number, and the value of correlation is higher than the correlation with outdoor temperature. The magnitude of the positive correlation factors between demand with an hour and day number is quite small, because the amount of hot water demand is not direclty a linear function of an hour or day. For example, the amount of demand does not increase with the increment of hours. However, temporal features are important for learning the routines of occupants, for example, at what time the peaks of demands are expected to happen. A very useful characteristic of the agent is to automatically adjust the relative importance given to each feature and neglect the features which are not useful; therefore, if one or both of the temporal features are not helpful, it will learn to neglect them over the training phase. Including only one timestep of these temporal features is then useful to reduce the curse of dimensionality while making sure the agent has access to this information to consider or neglect them. 3.3 Sensitivity analysis of hyper-parameters The proper selection of hyper-parameters can significantly improve the performance of the RL framework. To select the best performing hyper-parameters, a sensitivity analysis is performed on selected parameters such as the weight factors a , b, c of the reward function and the number of previous hours ( demandlags ) to in the state array. Each set of hyper-parameters is called a scenario in this paper. All scenarios for the sensitivity analysis are trained for 27 weeks and deployed for 2 weeks to ensure the convergence of each scenario and, therefore, their fair comparison (some scenarios do not converge if fewer train weeks are considered). The number of previous hours to be considered for outdoor air temperature is fixed to 6 h for all scenarios. Since both the train and deployment stages should be repeated for each scenario, the number of evaluated scenarios is limited to 6 to keep the analysis manageable. To compare the performance of evaluated scenarios, two metrics to quantify energy-saving and comfort preservation outcomes of the frameworks are defined in Equations (4) and (5). (4) Energysaving = E baseline - E RL E RL × 100 (5) Comfort = Violateddemand ( L ) Totaldemand ( L ) × 100 E baseline and E RL are the total energy use of the RL and the baseline controllers in kWh. Violateddemand is the amount of demand supplied with a temperature below 40 °C. The comparison is made for the deployment stage, where all the scenarios are converged and control of the hot water system based on their optimal policy. Fig. 16 shows the selected parameters and performance metrics of each scenario over the deployment phase. Due to the severe punishment of the reward function by the hygiene term, all scenarios well respect the hygiene aspect by over-heating the tank once per day. Therefore, evaluated scenarios are only compared in terms of energy- and comfort metrics. The first three scenarios aim to adjust the relative importance of the reward terms, and the last three scenarios aim to adjust the number of previous hours of demand intervals to be included in the state. The first scenario is executed with a = 1 , b = 4 , c = 1 , and demandlags = 6 . This scenario provides energy saving of 16.25% compared to the baseline controller while preserving the occupants' comfort all the time. To identify the increase in energy-saving potential without the disturbance of occupants' comfort, the relative importance of the comfort term b is reduced to 3 in scenario 2. It results in a 13% increase in energy saving. However, the occupants' comfort is violated by 8%. The average temperature of the instances when the occupants' comfort is violated is 39.1 °C, which is very close to the comfort threshold of 40 °C. Therefore, this scenario could be acceptable for the buildings where the occupants are not very sensitive to slight temperature violations but prefer higher energy savings. Since it is desired to always maintain occupants' comfort, the comfort weight b is increased from 3 to 3.5 in scenario 3. In such a scenario, the comfort of occupants is always preserved, while energy saving increases by 1.4% compared to scenario 1 savings. Therefore, the combination of weighting factors defined in scenario 3 ( a = 1 , b = 3.5 , c = 1 ) is selected to preserve comfort and hygiene. In a more detailed approach, the combination of factors can be adjusted by hyper-parameter optimization methods, which is, however, out of the scope of this particular research. After fixing the combination of the factors for the reward, the number of hours of the previous demand intervals in the state (demand lags) is increased to 12, 24, and 48 in scenarios 4, 5, and 6, respectively. The number of previous demands to be included in the vector is increased to 12, 24, and 48 to let the agent observe the previous profile over half-day, one-day, and two-days ago. It should be noted that increased demand lags, on one hand, provide more information to the agent about the sequence of previous demands helping to better predict the future sequence, but, on the other hand, the dimensionality of the network increases leading to more computation time and reduced accuracy. Increasing the demand lags from 6 to 12 has significantly increased the energy saving (from 17.67% to 23.8%), while preserving the occupants' comfort. Further increase of the demand lags to 24 and 48 slightly increases the energy-saving potential while the occupants' comfort is violated somewhat. Therefore, a demand lags of 12 can be considered as optimum. Scenario 4 having the highest energy-saving potential among scenarios totally preserving occupants' comfort (100%) is selected as the best performing scenario, and it will be discussed in more detail in the next section. 3.4 Performance of the best-performing scenario The evolution of the reward over the training episodes is an important indicator of the goodness of the training process. The higher the total reward the better the performance of the agent. To ensure that the agent r reaches an optimal policy and the duration of the training stage is sufficient, the convergence of the total reward over the training episodes should be supervised. Fig. 17 shows the evolution of the total reward and the constituting terms over the train and deployment stages on the target house. To evaluate the instability of the reward, it is important to consider the range of possible variations of the defined reward function. The total reward function in this study is consisted of three terms: energy reward, comfort reward, and hygiene reward. The comfort and hygiene terms are supposed to reach zero at the optimal policy. However, the energy expenditure to heat water is not avoidable, and, therefore, these terms are not expected to reach zero even at optimal conditions. Fluctuations of the energy term over different episodes (different weeks) are affected by the amount of hot water demand over each week, thus, small variations of this term caused by the demand variations and do not necessarily indicate a non-convergent policy. The evolution of the total reward shown in Fig. 17 indicates that the agent has converged to an optimal policy at the end of the training period, with the comfort and hygiene terms get stable at near zero. There are some fluctuations between weeks 15 and 21 of the training stage. Over this period, the energy reward is slightly increased, but the comfort and hygiene rewards are decreased. Therefore, it shows that the agent has been trying to save more energy by reducing the tank temperature during this period. However, after receiving negative rewards on hygiene and comfort terms, it has slightly increased the energy expenditure again in week 21 to keep the hygiene and comfort rewards at zero. It should be noted that considering the possible range of variations of the reward terms, the fluctuations over the online train period are negligible and should not be interpreted as unsatisfactory operation. In the worth case scenario in week 16, the comfort term has reached −2. Considering the definition of the comfort term, it shows that the average violation of comfort temperature in the worth case has been less than 1 °C, which is negligible. Similarly, the hygiene reward over this week has reached −0.5, showing that, on average, the delay in daily overheating has been less than 1 h. Although the results show some fluctuations in the reward terms, the variations are very small and it can be considered that the reward value has been almost stable from the first week of training on the target house. This stability in the reward value shows that the agent has already obtained significant experience during offline training and does not violate the comfort and hygiene terms from the very beginning week of online training. This is an indicator of fast convergence and satisfactory performance even during the online training stage, which is due to the intensive offline training (6 years of experience for agent) before training the agent on the target house. Thus, it shows the importance of the statistical hot water usage model to represent occupants\u2019 behavior over the offline training stage. It also highlights the substantial adaptability of the agent, as the behavior of occupants over the COVID-19 pandemic has been very different from the statistical-based normal behavior that the agent has experienced over the offline training stage. To further characterize the agent performance, the performance of the selected best-performing scenario over the deployment stage is shown in Fig. 18 . It is important to monitor if the agent has learned and adapted to the occupants' behavior, if it properly follows the hygiene aspect, and if it considers the advantage of higher outdoor temperature for heating the water. Comparison of the control signal (action) versus demand shows that the agent has properly learned the occupants' behavior, by turning ON the system during or even before the demand and turning it OFF when no demand is expected. Therefore, the tank temperature has never exceeded the lower limit of 40 °C , and the occupants' comfort has always been preserved. Comparison of the tank temperature versus demand also indicates that the overheating schedule is properly adapted to the demand, as most of the time agent has overheated the tank before or during the demand to ensure that the energy used for overheating the water will not be wasted due to the heat losses. The cumulated number of hours from the last superheat is consistently below 24, indicating that the tank is adequately sterilized and the achieved energy saving is not achieved at a cost of higher Legionella risk. Since the health of the occupants has a higher priority than their comfort, the hygiene term in Equation (3) punishes the agent for every single hour exceeding the 24 h threshold from the last superheat. Consequently, the agent is very considerate about the health-related term, and non of the evaluated scenarios violate this aspect. Analysis of the control signal with respect to the outdoor air temperature indicates that most of the ON signals occur during the hours of high outdoor temperatures. However, as comfort and hygiene are of a higher priority than energy saving, the ON signals do not perfectly match the instances of elevated outdoor temperatures, and there are also several instances when the agent heats water even though the outdoor air temperature is low. For comparison, the performance of the conventional two-point controller is also evaluated and presented in Fig. 19 . By considering only the tank temperature, the two-point controller turns ON the heat pump only during the demand, which is not necessarily the best time for heating the tank due to the COP variations of the heat pump. Therefore, the main advantage of the proposed RL-based control framework over the conventional method is in the learning behavior of occupants which enables the system to operate at the highest COP while preserving the occupants' comfort. 4 Suggestions for future work There is ample room for further research on this topic. A great potential of the RL is that different dimensions can be easily added to the framework by including corresponding terms in the states and reward. The proposed framework can be further developed by: \u2022 Including the time-varying electricity price in the states and the energy cost in the reward function to optimize the heat pump operational cost; \u2022 Including the number of ON and OFF switchings in the states and the heat pump age in the reward to ensure a smooth operation and a longer lifetime of the heat pump; \u2022 Integration of a deep learning demand prediction model, trained on enough data to be transferrable to different buildings and ensure the generalizability of the framework; \u2022 Combination of renewable energy (photovoltaic or solar thermal panels) to the system and the associated terms in the states and reward function for using the flexibility of hot water tank for optimal integration of renewable energy resources; \u2022 Developing an offline training stage that can ensure enough experience for the agent and eliminate the need for online training stage; 5 Conclusion This paper proposes an occupant-centric control framework based on the model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) for heat pump water heating systems. The proposed framework balances hygiene, a critical health-related aspect of water heating systems, occupants' comfort, and energy consumption. The training stage is separated into two different stages in the proposed framework, including an offline training using a stochastic hot water use model to mimic occupants behavior, and an online training using the actual hot water use data of occupants. The offline training aims to provide the controlling agent an initial experience with the system, occupants' behavior, and climatic conditions, and, therefore, ensure fast convergence and preservation of the occupants' comfort on the target system. A stochastic hot water use model is included at this stage to represent a realistic hot water use behavior. The agent is trained offline for 6 different climatic conditions of Switzerland using 6 years of weather data (2014\u20132020). For online training, the actual hot water use behavior of a single-family residential building is monitored for 29 weeks. The monitoring campaign taken place during the COVID-19 pandemic (28 August 2020\u201319 March 2021) when almost all occupants were working from home and, therefore, had an unusual hot water use behavior compared to pre-pandemic times. The proposed framework does not rely on any hot water supply system model to ensure its transferability to other residential buildings. The following conclusions can be drawn from this study: \u2022 Statistical analysis on the monitored demand data reveals the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the hot water use behavior. There is no strong differentiation between the weekdays and weekends patterns compared to the \u201dnormal\u201d (pre-pandemic) patterns reported in previous studies [9,35]. Furthermore, there are 3 peaks in the average hourly pattern, while only 2 peaks are reported for the normal, pre-pandemic cases [9,35]. \u2022 The proposed framework with the selected design of hyper-parameters can provide an energy saving of 23.8% over two weeks of deployment compared to the common rule-based control method. The evolution of the total reward during the training and the deployment phase on the target building shows a fast convergence and preservation of the occupants' comfort from the very beginning of training, despite the unusual hot water use behavior due to the pandemic. It indicates the effectiveness and importance of the offline training with a stochastic hot water use model. \u2022 Analysis of scenarios with different combinations of hyper-parameters indicates an optimum for the number of prior hours to be considered in the demand lags, thus, the inclusion of more hours does not necessarily increase the performance. \u2022 Comparison of control actions (ON/OFF) versus water demand shows that the agent has properly learned the occupants' behavior to ensure their comfort, which indicates the adaptive potential of the proposed framework user behavior changes such as changes in water use-related habits imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic in this study. The findings of this study, performed during the COVID-19 pandemic period with the altered behavior of occupants, highlighted the importance of adaptive control for building energy systems. Future studies on the current topic are therefore required to investigate the potentials of RL for building energy systems.

        "dc:description": "Occupants\u2019 behavior is a major source of uncertainty for the optimal operation of building energy systems. The highly stochastic hot water use behavior of occupants has led to conservative operational strategies for hot water systems, that try to ensure occupants\u2019 comfort by following energy-intensive operational approaches. Intending to integrate the occupants\u2019 behavior into hot water systems control, this study proposes a control framework based on Reinforcement Learning, which can learn the stochastic occupants' behavior and make a balance between opposing objectives of water hygiene, comfort, and energy use. A model-free approach is implemented to ensure transferability. To achieve fast convergence on the target house while being model-free, this study proposes an offline training procedure integrating a stochastic hot water use model to mimic the hot water use behavior of occupants. The proposed framework is then evaluated using an actual hot water use and weather dataset collected over 29 weeks from a residential house in Switzerland. The performance of the proposed control framework is compared to the conventional rule-based controller as the common practice in hot water systems. While the hot water use dataset has been collected during the COVID-19 pandemic, with an abnormal schedule of occupants, results indicate that the proposed control framework could successfully learn and adapt to the occupants' behavior and achieve 23.8% of energy saving, while maintaining the occupants' comfort and water hygiene. The adaptive nature of the proposed control framework shows significant potential in reducing the discrepancy between supply and demand in hot water systems.",
