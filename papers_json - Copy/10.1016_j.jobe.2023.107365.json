Innovation Institute for Sustainable Maritime Architecture Research and Technology, Qingdao University of Technology, Qingdao, 266033, China. Innovation Institute for Sustainable Maritime Architecture Research and Technology Qingdao University of Technology Qingdao 266033 China With improved building energy-saving standards and development of on-site renewable energy, efficient energy management strategies and enhanced energy flexibility can play crucial role in decarbonizing the building energy system. In this work, the potential of the thermal energy flexibility of space heating in Japanese zero energy house is analyzed based on real measurements and a reduced-order simulation model. The impacts of relevant parameters on energy flexibility were provided under different conditions. The model predictive control (MPC) framework was then developed for the house space heating system, and it formulated the optimization as a mixed-integer linear programming problem for minimizing energy consumption while maintaining indoor thermal comfort. The results of conducted case studies verified the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed optimization approach in achieving flexible control of space heating systems. The control performances of the proposed MPC strategies were associated with different objectives, comparative analysis demonstrates that the designed control approach can effectively achieve an optimal trade-off between on-site photovoltaic consumption and thermal comfort by allowing acceptable indoor temperature violations. The energy flexibility provided by the space heating system could achieve an approximately 20% improvement in photovoltaic self-consumption ratio compared to real measurement over the testing period.

In terms of energy efficiency, nearly or net-zero energy buildings are increasingly considered as a promising solution to reduce carbon emissions [4,5]. The residential sector shares a significant portion of the total building energy consumption, advanced net zero energy houses (ZEHs) can offer a solution in that they require less energy than is produced by distributed energy generations over the course of a year [6,7]. A series of management strategy and incentive policy have been announced for advocating the applications of building integrated renewable energy resources in different countries [4,5,8]. In existing buildings, the heating, ventilation and air conditioning system shares about 50% of the building energy use, the large thermal inertia of building thermal mass could be managed to provide potential energy flexibility [9,10]. With the development of on-site energy generators, buildings are becoming energy prosumers, presenting a substantial energy flexibility potential [11,12]. However, most operational parameters of building energy systems are based on experiences or rule-based on-off control, those approaches usually lack the ability to compensate for the thermal lag and intermittency of integrated renewable generation [13]. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that people spend approximately 90% of their time in buildings, therefore minimizing energy use while maintaining occupant indoor thermal comfort is an important issue [14,15]. Therefore, efforts to develop effective real-time energy management strategies are highlighted to contribute to achieving the carbon neutrality goal in the building sector. 2 Related works 2.1 Thermal energy flexibility To reduce energy consumption and carbon dioxide emission in building sector, improved thermal insulation standards and on-site renewable energy development are adopted as main energy conservation efforts [16\u201318]. Building energy saving standards have been evolving, thermophysical parameters (thermal resistance and thermal capacitance, RC) of building envelope change accordingly, and the intermittency of on-site renewable generation leads to a mismatch between energy supply and demand profiles [19]. In this context, the structural thermal mass of buildings is increasingly considered an important flexibility resource to address the energy mismatch between demand and on-site generation through a trade-off between the thermostatically controlled load and thermal comfort [20,21]. The flexible control of thermal energy loads focuses on adjusting or modulating the thermal energy delivered to the building through allowing acceptable indoor temperature variations [22]. For example, optimal building pre-conditioning (pre-cooling or pre-heating) process could be used as a virtual thermal energy storage for upward or downward thermal energy modulation, thus activating demand flexibility [23\u201325]. In addition, the potential of thermally activated energy flexibility is closely related to indoor setpoints and variable weather conditions [26,27]. In order to better explore energy flexibility of the building thermal mass, establishing an optimal thermodynamic model to accurately capture the dynamic characteristics of the demand energy flexibility is becoming an important issue to control building energy system effectively. 2.2 Modelling approach To implement an optimization in the building energy system, a key work is to struct a prediction model for capturing the dynamic behaviors of the control subject. The white-box, grey-box and black-box models are commonly adopted to predict the building thermal dynamics [28]. Building thermodynamic model is a typical nonlinear multivariable system, white-box is created based on a deep understanding of the system physical process and parameters, the modeling process is time consuming [29]. Black-box is a data-driven model based on historical operational data, it may suffer from imprecise prediction when the training data is not sufficient, and the accuracy of the model is significantly influenced by the quality of the available data. The reduced-order grey-box model is established based on the physical model and parameters are calculated based on input-output data, achieving a trade-off between the network order and the desired accuracy. In contrast to the white-box model, the reduced-order grey-box control model can save modeling time and ensure computational efficiency [30], which is popularly adopted for MPC-driven energy management framework. MPC optimization framework can use reduced-order RC network and disturbance models for prediction and state estimation, and flexibly manage the operation of the building energy system. 2.3 Control approach With the changes in decentralized energy supply and storage in building energy systems, the operational control strategy generally attempts to make effective decisions in response to the dynamic environment [5,31,32]. Developing effective control strategies for building energy system management has significantly impacted energy conservation and economic performances [33\u201335], which had attracted growing research interests [36]. In contrast to the conventional control methods such as simple on/off or proportional-integral (PI) control, MPC is a model-based approach for constrained control considering both current and future states [34,37]. One of advantages of MPC approach is that it merges principles of feedback control and numerical optimization over a given time horizon. The MPC can use forecasts of weather, renewable generation or electricity price signals to generate an optimal control strategy, which has demonstrated its effectiveness in improving energy efficiency, such as minimizing cost and reducing carbon emission [38,39]. As already mentioned, increasing variable renewable energies bring more generation fluctuations, Ref [40] highlights the benefit of coordinated control of air conditioning system to provide regulation service for power system. Authors in Ref. [41] actives building thermal mass energy storage to maximize local PV self-consumption ratio. Ref [42] uses building thermal mass to increase cooling system energy flexibility of nearly zero-energy office building, a rule-based control curtailed 55.6% of peak load. Authors in Ref. [34] applied an economic MPC in a combined thermal and electric residential building energy system, effectively increase photovoltaic self-consumption. Ref [43] adopted MPC controller for a retail building HVAC system, bringing 1.7% cost savings while achieving the same thermal comfort. Authors in Ref. [44] implemented an economic-MPC framework for building a polygeneration system, cost savings reached up to 12%. The model inaccuracy and uncertain disturbances such as energy price signal and weather conditions would challenge MPC for optimal operational management of building energy systems [45,46]. It is worth noting that the building energy demand and decentralized renewable energy generation are significantly variable and weather dependent, which adds to the complexity of the building energy system management [47,48]. The robust MPC is an improved version of nominal MPC that takes uncertainties of disturbances into consideration during optimization process [33,49]. MPC-driven building energy system management with the sole objective of energy or cost minimization may lead to undesired results, such as new peak load [50,51]. Currently, grid feed-in of distributed PV generation has caused duck curve issues, which is mainly regulated through curtailment in Japan. Moreover, the feed-in tariff value presents a continuous dropping trend, which is below the electricity price in the residential sector [4]. Therefore, the optimal interaction between buildings and grid benefits both sides based on maximizing on-site renewable energy consumption [13,52]. Recent works highlight proper management strategy to achieve a trade-off between occupants' comfort and on-site renewable energy consumption ratio [19,53,54]. In this work, the proposed case studies test the performance of a designed robust MPC management strategy for flexible control of ZEHs\u2019 space heating system. The main contributions of this work are summarized as follows: ● This work demonstrates the flexibility performance of space heating in existing Japanese ZEHs, whose energy-saving standard of envelope is significantly improved, monitored operational data and simulation model were used to reveal the potential energy flexibility. ● Based on the reduced-order grey-box model, the MPC optimization framework was employed to unlock thermal energy flexibility of building space heating system while ensuring indoor thermal comfort. ● Assess and compare the optimized performances of proposed MPC controllers in terms of heating energy usage, thermal comfort and on-site PV self-consumption. The remaining of this paper is organized as follows: an MPC optimization framework for ZEHs' heating system, including the building thermal dynamic model, control constraints and optimized objectives is introduced and established in Section 3. Section 4 uses case studies to validate the accuracy of the developed reduced-order model to capture ZEH's thermal behaviors and present thermal energy flexibility potential. Findings of case study and simulated MPC performances are described in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 concludes and identifies future works. 3 Method 3.1 Building thermal model In order to capture thermal behaviors of buildings, the thermodynamic model of the building is formulated using a simplified third-order RC network. Each thermal zone of the employed network is developed using the lumped resistance and capacitance approach, including internal thermal mass, indoor air, house envelope and outdoor environment, the heating energy interactions Q among components, as described in Fig. 1 . The internal thermal mass is the energy absorbed from the dissipated heat of interior walls, furniture and equipment. The indoor air exchanges heat with the internal substance and the inner surface of the envelope, and absorbs the heat of the solar radiation entering through the windows, and the heat energy generated by an air conditioner is assumed to be absorbed by the indoor air, ventilation heat loss is also considered. The thermal resistance of the envelope considers the convective heat exchange with the outdoor environment and the radiative heat transfer with the sky. The outdoor environment includes ambient temperature and solar radiation. Once all the parameters and boundary conditions are known, the energy balance for each node is described as the following mathematical equations: (1) C n d T n d t = T m − T n R n , m + T e n − T n R e n , n + Q s o l a r , n + Q a c + Q v e n (2) C e n d T e n d t = T n − T e n R e n , n + T o − T e n R e n + Q s o l a r , e n (3) C m d T m d t = T n − T m R n , m + Q int e r (4) Q s o l a r , n = α A w i n I s o l a r (5) Q s o l a r , e n = β A e n I s o l a r Where, R and C represent the equivalent thermal resistance and heat capacitance of the nodes, T denotes zone temperatures, subscripts m , n , o , e n and w i n present internal thermal mass, indoor air, outdoor air, envelope and windows, respectively. Q a c refers to air conditioning heating energy load. Q s o l a r , e n and Q s o l a r , n are solar heat gains absorbed by external wall and indoor air (through the window), respectively. Q i n t e r indicates internal heat gains due to the lighting and electrical equipment, Q v e n indicates the heat loss due to mechanical ventilation, estimated by the designed ventilation rate, I s o l a r is global solar radiation, A presents geometric area, α and β define the absorptance of surface for solar radiation. 3.2 Model linearization The system of equations can be expressed with the continuous state-space form, which can be effectively used to deal with the output feedback problem: (6) { d x / d t = A c x + B c u + E c d y = C x Where, x is a state vector (representing the temperatures), y defines the system output (indoor air temperature), u represents control variable (space heating energy input), d = [ T o , Q s o l a r , Q int e r ] is a vector denotes the disturbances, including outdoor air temperature, solar radiation and internal heat gain. The matrices A c , B c and E c are composed of parameters of the buildings, calculated according to Eqs. (1)\u2013(3): (7) A c = − [ 1 C n ⋅ R n , m + 1 C n ⋅ R e n , n − 1 C n ⋅ R e n , n − 1 C n ⋅ R n , m − 1 C e n ⋅ R e n , n 1 C e n ⋅ R e n , n + 1 C e n ⋅ R e n 0 − 1 C m ⋅ R n , m 0 1 C m ⋅ R n , m ] (8) B c = [ 1 C n 0 0 ] (9) E c = [ 0 α A w i n C n 0 1 C e n ⋅ R e n β A e n C e n 0 0 0 1 C m ] (10) C = [ 1 0 0 ] The parameter matrices, A c , B c and E c , includes 10 unknown parameters [ R e n R e n , n R n , m C n C e n C m A e n A w i n α β ] . The estimated values of heat resistance and capacitance of investigated houses were determined according to physical characteristics and measured data. Root mean square error (RMSE), mean bias error (MBE) and coefficient of variation of the root mean square error (CVRMSE) are the performance metrics for evaluating the accuracy of the simulation model, expressed with the following equations. (11) R M S E = ∑ i = 1 N ( T r i − Y i ) 2 N (12) M B E = ∑ i = 1 N ( T r i − Y i ) ∑ i = 1 N T r i (13) C V R M S E = ∑ i = 1 N [ ( T r i − Y i ) 2 N ] 1 N ∑ i = 1 N T r i Where, T r presents measured temperature, Y i denotes simulated output at each time-step i , N is the number of data-points. 3.3 MPC formulation 3.3.1 Discrete-time system model To deal with the feedback control problem, next step is to discretize the continuous state-space form equations, and convert them into the following discrete-time form: (14) { x ( i + 1 ) = A x ( i ) + B u ( i ) + E d ( i ) y ( i ) = C x ( i ) f o r i = 0,1 \u2026 , P − 1 , P Where, i is the sampling interval, and the prediction range is denoted by P , i = 0,1 , ⋯ , P − 1 . x ( i + 1 ) denotes the predicted state from sampling time i to i + 1 . The predicted values of the system state x (or output) and the input u are used to calculate the control input by solving the optimization problem. The matrices in the state-space model are defined in Eqs. 7\u201310. Once the model has been discretized, we can formulate the prediction of the outputs (or states) over the prediction horizon. 3.3.2 System optimization The purposes of the MPC controller of building energy systems mainly focus on minimizing the energy consumption while maintaining indoor thermal comfort. In this section, we evaluate the performances of two MPC controllers with different goals in terms of optimized indoor thermal comfort, energy consumption and on-site PV consumption. Firstly, the optimization objective of the MPC1 controller is set to minimize the energy consumption for space heating while maintaining the room temperature within the comfort range, we set slack variables to satisfy the solution of the optimized controller, the following equation expresses the optimization problem： (15) J 1 = ∑ i = 1 N ( y i − y r e f ) T V ( y i − y r e f ) + ∑ i = 1 N u i T R u i + ∑ i = 1 N σ i T S σ i Constraints of input and states are expressed with the following constraints: (16) { ∀ i , u min ≤ u i ≤ u max , ∀ i , y min − σ i ≤ y i ≤ y max + σ i . Where, y i is system output at time i , denotes indoor temperature, y r e f represents user-defined temperature. To ensure that the equation of the optimized objective is homogeneous, V , R and S are defined as the weight matrices to balance the weight between thermal comfort and energy consumption, in which R is heating energy weighting matrix, and V and S are temperature weighting matrices. y min and y max present user-defined upper and lower limits for indoor temperatures, u i denotes the control input at time interval i , u min and u max present maximum and minimum input heating energy bounds, respectively. σ 1 and σ 2 define non-negative slack variables softening the temperature constraints, avoiding infeasible solutions to optimization problems when the constraints are not satisfied. On-site renewable energy generation, such as rooftop photovoltaic production, usually leads to a mismatch between electricity supply and demand. Secondly, the optimization of the MPC2 controller is set to balance the needs of reducing energy consumption and maintaining indoor thermal comfort, additional objective of increasing the on-site consumption of rooftop PV generation is included. The optimization goal of a multi-objective problem can be expressed by the following equation: (17) J 2 = ∑ i = 1 N e i T E e i − ∑ i = 1 N v i T P v i + ∑ i = 1 N σ i T S σ i The constraints at each time interval i are described as follows: (18) { ∀ i , u min ≤ u i ≤ u max , ∀ i , y min − σ i ≤ y i ≤ y max + σ i , ∀ i , 0 ≤ e i , ∀ i , 0 ≤ v i ≤ p v . Where, e and v represent the grid import and electricity consumption of the photovoltaic generation, respectively, p v is the real-time PV generation. In the objective function, E and P denote the weighting factor matrices of grid import and PV consumption, respectively. Fig. 2 presents the flowchart of the present work to implement the MPC controller, the algorithm was developed in MATLAB environment, the YALMIP toolbox was used to formulate the mixed-integer linear programming, deployed MPC controller calculates real-time setpoints over a prediction horizon by solving the optimization problem. 3.4 Case study In order to test the ability of the MPC to adapt to different conditions, the case study selected two ZEHs constructed in 2017, located in Kyushu, Japan. The coldest month of this region is January. The U values of house envelope are strictly insulated to meet zero energy house standard. Our previous works have present the advantage of the examined houses in energy saving [6,21]. Detailed information of the selected ZEHs is presented in Table 1 . The air-source heat pump uses a conventional proportional integral control strategy for space heating supply to maintain the indoor temperature range, the mechanical ventilation rate is 0.5 ac/h. PV panels are installed on east and south roof of ZEHs, the smart home energy management system can automatically collect ZEHs\u2019 electricity consumption and generation monitored by a smart meter at 30-min intervals [16], indoor temperature was measured by the temperature sensor TR-72wf with measurement accuracy ±0.5 °C, recording interval is 30-minitute in this work. According to measured data and manufacture information, the coefficient of performance of the air-source heat pump at kth time interval is defined as the function of ambient temperature as following. (19) c o p a c ( k ) = 2.40 / ( 0.0021 × T 0 ( k ) 2 − 0.059 × T 0 ( k ) + 1 ) 4 Results and discussions 4.1 Model validation The construction of a reliable model to accurately capture the thermal behavior of the house is crucial to develop an effective MPC controller. Firstly, to evaluate the accuracy of the developed reduced-order RC model, Fig. 3 describes results of using measured and simulated data of the two ZEHs during the testing period, corresponding outdoor temperature and solar irradiance profiles were also presented. The results of RMSE, MBE and CVRMSE of two ZEHs are summarized in Table 2 , CVRMSE<30% and MBE<10% which satisfied the requirements of ASHRAE Guideline 14\u20132014 [55]. The following section uses the validated model to capture the thermal behaviors of the ZEH under different simulated conditions. 4.2 Thermal energy flexibility Thermal energy flexibility can be activated by decreasing or increasing setpoint temperatures, temperature adjustment leads to delayed or forced thermal energy load over a certain period. Considering the buildings' thermal mass as thermal storage, this part uses the reduced-order RC model to investigate how the parameters including weather conditions and setpoint indoor temperature affect the flexibility potential of the ZEHs' space heating system. Based on the measurement and validated model, Fig. 4 illustrates the ZEH1's real and simulated indoor temperature and power consumption profiles at 30-min intervals. As observed, real-time power consumption for air conditioner space heat has a close relationship with the indoor setpoint temperature, and ZEH presents a great ability to retain indoor heat energy when switching off the space heating system, exhibiting a short-term energy flexibility potential. To further demonstrate the performance of thermal energy flexibility, Fig. 5 presents the simulated dynamic behaviors of ZEH1 with the preheating strategies under different boundary conditions. In detail, firstly the house is preheated from 24 °C to the defined upper comfort limit of 26 °C, then space heating is turned off until the indoor air temperature drops to a lower comfort limit of 22 °C, finally heating system starts to reheat the room to 24 °C. As shown in Fig. 5, the duration time denotes the timespan when the indoor temperature falls from the upper comfort limit to the lower comfort limit. Notice that the effect of ambient temperature on the duration time is significant, decreasing outdoor temperature shortens the duration time. Part of thermal energy is continuously lost to the outdoor environment during the heat-up process, quantification of thermal energy flexibility needs to consider the influences of preheating setpoint temperature, thermal capacity and ambient temperature. Table 3 reported the thermal response behaviors of two ZEHs\u2019 heating systems using energy consumption and duration time indicators under different preheating events. Results show that low ambient temperature shortens the duration time, the increase in heat energy consumption is larger at higher preheat temperature setpoint, for example, the preheat setpoint temperature of ZEH1 increases from 26 °C to 27 °C, a rise of heat energy consumption for space heating 8.3 kJ/m2 is seen when the ambient temperature is 0 °C. The rise of space heating energy consumption is less at 5 °C ambient conditions. Similar results are observed in simulation cases of ZEH2. The results validate that high preheat setpoint temperature and low ambient temperature decrease the energy efficiency of virtual thermal energy storage. This also indicates the importance of implementing a proper energy control strategy when exploiting thermal energy flexibility in terms of energy consumption. The following part will report the results of proposed MPC approaches that help manage indoor temperature through constraints and show how the MPC controller activates thermal energy flexibility. 4.3 Operational scenarios Simulation studies were conducted using the two control methods described above to test the proposed two MPC controllers' performance. One-week experiments of selected ZEHs were conducted during the heating season, 9th Jan to 15th January for ZEH1 and 2nd Feb to 8th Feb for ZEH2. The historical weather data is used as forecast input data based on the collected open dataset. The ambient temperature prediction time horizon is 4 h with a sample time of 30 min. Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 display the regulated time-series indoor temperature profiles of ZEH1 and ZEH2 to compare with the measurements, respectively. The blue lines depict the regulated indoor temperature profiles of the MPC1 controller to minimize energy consumption while maintaining thermal comfort. The green line presents the indoor temperature profile of the MPC2 controller added with the reward of increasing the on-site PV consumption ratio. MPC-based control presents time-varying comfort constraints. Compared to the baseline (measurement), the MPC1 strategy successfully tracks and maintains the indoor temperature within the predefined comfort zone, and regulated indoor temperature presents a relatively stable value. Both MPC controllers can suppress indoor temperature fluctuations compared to the baseline. The optimized indoor temperature of the MPC2 strategy fluctuates more, creating temporarily higher indoor temperature setpoints within the acceptable comfort range, yielding larger indoor temperature deviations compared with the MPC1 strategy. As observed, the MPC approach continually adjusts the indoor temperature setpoint. The daily comfort violation is high when the PV generation is abundant, daily indoor temperature changes less when the available PV generation is relatively small. This aspect suggests MPC approach provides a chance to consume more site PV generation by preheating the house, thus reducing grid import in the process. Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 describe the control results of power flows for space heating of examined ZEHs throughout selected periods. The measurements described in the red line are given as baseline. The blue lines present the electricity flows of the MPC1 strategy. As can be observed, the MPC1 shows a similar performance to examined ZEHs\u2019 electricity consumption, which fluctuates less to maintain a stable indoor temperature. Overall, the power consumption of space heating highly depends on the weather conditions. Since the added reward of increasing on-site PV consumption in the objective function, deployed MPC2 controller has a larger maximum flexible power consumption than the MPC1 controller. This aspect increases electricity consumption of space heating during the daytime, providing an opportunity to exploit more on-site PV generation and reducing grid power import in the later time. Moreover, the space heating system operates in intermittent conditions to meet a comfortable range of ZEH2, demonstrating house thermal flexibility is utilized during the optimized period. To analyze the power consumption for space heating of proposed MPC controllers in detail, Figs. 10 and 11 illustrate the control results of power consumption flows for two ZEHs over seven days. It can observe that PV generation can satisfy the electrical power demands for space heating at certain times of daytime when PV generation is sufficient. It is quite evident that the MPC2 controller consumes more on-site PV consumption compared to the MPC1 controller, resulting in a decrease in electricity imported from the grid. According to the results described in Figs. 6 and 7, the MPC2 controller schedules the operation of the space heating system to daytime and increases the room temperature to a higher tolerable room temperature. As a result, the MPC2 controller enables an optimal trade-off between thermal comfort and on-site PV consumption by allowing a flexible operation of the space heating system. Furthermore, to compare the changes in energy consumption over the optimized period, the components of ZEHs\u2019 electricity consumption under the MPC control approach are depicted in Fig. 12 and Fig. 13 . Compared with the measurements, the MPC approach improves thermal comfort. As a result, the electricity consumption for space heating increases but is not significant. The total energy consumption of the MPC1 controller is the largest, followed by the MPC2 controller. It is also worth noting that the increasing ratios of power consumption in ZEH2 were greater. The reasons for this can be found in the larger increase of optimized indoor temperature under proposed MPC controllers. As can be observed, both MPC controllers are capable of increasing on-site PV consumption in terms of reducing grid import. As described above, MPC2 successfully increased the power consumption for space heating during the daytime by allowing a higher comfort violation. This helps increase on-site PV consumption and reduce grid import. Lastly, Table 4 summarizes the control performances of ZEHs\u2019 indoor thermal comfort and on-site PV consumption under the proposed MPC approach in comparison with measurements. The aim of the proposed MPC approach focuses on energy saving and indoor thermal comfort aspects. In order to reduce grid import, the MPC optimizer was able to substantially increase PV self-consumption in all cases compared with the baseline scenario. According to the average indoor temperatures and variances, MPC control improves the thermal comfort level of ZEH2. As observed, MPC2 cases allow higher temperature variances in comparison with MPC1, thus further improving the on-site consumption ratio of PV generation. 5 Conclusions Improved energy-saving standards of building envelop provide a chance to exploit building thermal inertia, thus delivering additional thermal energy flexibility. This work investigated the thermal energy flexibility of existing ZEHs using measurements and a reduced-order thermodynamic model. Developed MPC controllers aim at achieving coordinated management in terms of thermal comfort, energy saving, and on-site PV consumption. MPC optimizations are implemented and compared using case studies. From the simulation results presented in this work, the main findings are summarized as follows: According to simulation-based performance, the thermostatically controlled space heating load of ZEH presents an obvious potential for energy flexibility with an improved energy-saving standard. The boundary conditions, including ambient temperature and indoor setpoint temperature can significantly influence flexibility performance. For example, the 10 °C drop in ambient temperature shortens around 76.5% of the duration time at 27 °C preheating setpoint condition. Preheating energy consumption presents an obvious increase with decreasing ambient temperature and increasing setpoint temperature. Simulation results reveal that proposed MPC strategies effectively control the flexible operation of ZEHs\u2019 space heating system, and MPC controllers outperformed the baseline scenario in satisfying indoor thermal comfort. With the included aim of increasing on-site PV consumption, the proposed MPC2 controller achieves around 20% increase in PV self-consumption ratio. Case studies of the two MPC controllers present that the designed approach can effectively optimize the trade-off between total energy consumption and thermal comfort violation, allowing increased thermal comfort violations to provide a chance to increase local PV consumption ratios. Results can provide insights into flexible building space heating in terms of energy or cost saving. Future work plans to conduct energy flexibility performance of buildings in different climate zones and assess the performances of MPC with a long-term implementation period. The cost performance of the flexible operation of the building energy system should be evaluated considering the market price.

        "dc:description": "With improved building energy-saving standards and development of on-site renewable energy, efficient energy management strategies and enhanced energy flexibility can play crucial role in decarbonizing the building energy system. In this work, the potential of the thermal energy flexibility of space heating in Japanese zero energy house is analyzed based on real measurements and a reduced-order simulation model. The impacts of relevant parameters on energy flexibility were provided under different conditions. The model predictive control (MPC) framework was then developed for the house space heating system, and it formulated the optimization as a mixed-integer linear programming problem for minimizing energy consumption while maintaining indoor thermal comfort. The results of conducted case studies verified the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed optimization approach in achieving flexible control of space heating systems. The control performances of the proposed MPC strategies were associated with different objectives, comparative analysis demonstrates that the designed control approach can effectively achieve an optimal trade-off between on-site photovoltaic consumption and thermal comfort by allowing acceptable indoor temperature violations. The energy flexibility provided by the space heating system could achieve an approximately 20% improvement in photovoltaic self-consumption ratio compared to real measurement over the testing period.",
