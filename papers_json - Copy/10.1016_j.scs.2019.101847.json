Sensors providing measurements for monitoring and control of indoor air quality (IAQ) are key components of the ventilation systems in subway stations. However, faulty sensors due to harsh ambient conditions may deliver incorrect information triggering misinterpretation; causing energy waste or IAQ deterioration. This paper presents a holistic online framework for sensor self-validation in a subway station based on a sparse autoencoder (AE) architecture. The sensor self-validation procedure consists of sensor fault detection, faulty sensor identification, and faulty sensor reconstruction. First, the AE-based detection rate between 44% and 100%. Then, the faulty sensor identification was conducted through an AE-sensor validity index (SVIAE ). The faulty sensor reconstruction was conducted by the AE structure and evaluated with several performance metrics. Finally, the sustainability and fault-tolerance aspects of this framework were verified through mathematical modeling of the ventilation system; showing the effects of the faulty and reconstructed sensors on energy consumption and public health. Keywords Fault-tolerant ventilation control Sensor self-validation Sparse autoencoder Subway transportation systems IAQ monitoring 1 Introduction The complexity and scale of modern industrial processes have significantly increased in recent decades; moreover, the reliability and safety of these processes are considered as crucial requirements (Yan, Guo, gong, & Li, 2016). Over the past few decades, online monitoring is a key procedure for maintaining a process in its normal operation (Yan et al., 2016; Zhao, 2018). Therefore, several studies have addressed the development of data-driven multivariate statistical process monitoring (MSPM) frameworks for fault diagnosis in industrial processes (Zhao, 2018). These frameworks have especially targeted building, atmospheric environments, and chemical treatment plants due to increasingly strict public health regulation regimens (Kim, Kim, Lim, Kim, & Yoo, 2010). The indoor air quality (IAQ) within confined public infrastructures is considered a hot research issue since it plays a significant role in human health. In particular, the environments in subway stations, which are especially affected by numerous time-variant disturbances, including rush hours, train traffic, and outdoor air quality (OAQ), are important and widespread examples of IAQ deterioration (Fontanini, Vaidya, & Ganapathysubramanian, 2016; Loy-Benitez et al., 2018). In subway stations, the IAQ is predominantly corrupted by particulate matter (PM), the composition and concentration of this contaminant differ from those at ground level (Han, Kwon, & Chun, 2016; Martins et al., 2016). In Seoul, for example, subway transportation is used by approximately four million people who spend a significant amount of time commuting on the available nine metro lines (Loy-Benitez et al., 2018). For these reasons, the Korea Ministry of Environment (MOE) established that subway stations represent an important public health issue (Lee, Hwangbo, Kim, & Yoo, 2017). The generation of hazardous contaminants in the subway environment has been the focus of many studies due to its adverse effects on human health (Loy-Benitez et al., 2018; Moreno et al., 2014). The alleviation of the deteriorated IAQ involves mechanical ventilation systems that take fresh air from the outdoors to dilute the indoor contaminants (Kim, Braatz, Kim, & Yoo, 2015; Kukadia & Palmer, 1998; Loy-Benitez et al., 2018). Nevertheless, considering the electrical demand, the ventilation systems in the subway stations account for approximately 35%\u201350% of the total building energy consumption (Lee et al., 2017; Loy-Benitez et al., 2018). This fact has represented a great concern for the research community since the use of current energy and the CO2 discharge are directly associated, with CO2 emissions projected to increase by 100% in 2050. Therefore, reducing energy consumption in subway systems is crucial for achieving future environmental objectives, including climate change mitigation (Anderson, Wulfhorst, & Lang, 2015; Guan, Liu, Zhang, & Xia, 2018). Then, considering that the ventilation systems in the subway infrastructure have a significant energy-saving potential, past investigations have attempted to find a sustainable balance in the trade-offs between energy consumption and acceptable IAQ levels (Kim et al., 2015, 2010; Lee et al., 2017; Liu, Lee et al., 2013; Loy-Benitez et al., 2018; Yang, Yu, Yu, & Ma, 2014). Several measures have been taken from the MOE to continuously monitor the IAQ of the Korean subway stations, including the establishment of indoor exposure laws and regulations, and the installation of sensors to detect and identify any abnormal event that may negatively affect the air quality (Liu et al., 2012; Loy-Benitez et al., 2018; Waeytens & Sadr, 2018). The telemonitoring system (TMS) installed in Korean subway stations consists of a group of sensors continuously measuring several variables that constitute the IAQ level in the indoor space (Kim, Liu, Kim, & Yoo, 2014; Liu et al., 2012). These sensors are valuable tools for ventilation control systems since the information they provide can be implemented on existing hardware, such as the fan speed controllers (Kim et al., 2014; Liukkonen, Hälikkä, Hiltunen, & Hiltunen, 2012). However, some subway station sensors are likely to fail due to the hostile environmental conditions, damaged electrical installations, and extended use (Kang et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2014). Then, the existence of a faulty sensor may provide incorrect information that might be misinterpreted by the ventilation control system, resulting in difficult or erroneous indoor contaminant regulation (Kim et al., 2014). Erroneous data in the IAQ monitoring process may be misinterpreted by the ventilation control system, causing a deterioration of the IAQ in a confined space when the contaminant level is underestimated; on the other hand, energy waste can occur when the contaminant level is overestimated and the ventilation fans run at higher speed (Liu, Kang et al., 2012, 2013). Therefore, a fault-tolerant ventilation control system is highly desired in hostile environments, where sensor functionality is prone to deteriorate. In recent times, fault-tolerant control (FTC) has received special attention due to its wide applicability in the industrial and building domain. Papadopoulos, Reppa, Polycarpou, and Panayiotou (2018) proposed a distributed FTC structure in a building to satisfy thermal comfort conditions by the manipulation of the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems in the presence of faulty temperature sensors (Papadopoulos et al., 2018). The FTC schema consists of the online adaptation of the controller parameters as the faults are detected and estimated (Li, Luo, Ding, Yang, & Peng, 2019). To overcome the problem of sensor faults in a variety of processes, the implementation of a holistic framework that includes fault detection, faulty sensor identification, and faulty sensor reconstruction (namely, sensor self-validation) is necessary. This framework has been conducted by the application of statistical methods including the principal components analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA), and dynamic component analysis (DICA) (Chen & Lan, 2010; Kim et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2012). Despite the numerous studies focused on executing effective IAQ monitoring techniques, those methods have not considered nonlinearity and they lack robustness for online monitoring within a sensor self-validation framework. Due to the complex characteristics of IAQ systems and the highly nonlinear relationships among their different variables, typical methods such as the popular PCA and ICA are not effective enough to learn important features from the data, resulting in low-quality monitoring performance (Chen & Lan, 2010; Kim, Liu, Kim, & Yoo, 2013, 2014; Zhang, Jiang, Li, & Yang, 2018). Furthermore, metro stations as building targets have certain unique features, including the fact that the IAQ variables show a dynamic and autocorrelative behavior due to the accumulation of contaminants (Oh et al., 2012). With the increasing investigation related to neural methods, the autoencoder (AE) model has been placed in a hot spot due to its reconstruction capability, being able to generalize prevalent methods as the PCA and ICA to consider the nonlinear and dynamic relationships existing in the data (Yan et al., 2016). To cope with all these issues, this study proposes a novel and sustainable IAQ monitoring approach based on an AE with a sensor self-validation framework in a subway station. Then, this method is coupled with a ventilation control system to generate a robust and fault-tolerant ventilation system to immediately absorb the failures and adapt the ventilation to its correct function in a sustainable fashion. This study is divided into three major sections. First, an AE structure was developed to detect, identify, and reconstruct IAQ sensor faults in a subway station. To detect the abnormal data, the squared prediction error ( S P E ) is used; then the faulty sensor, among all the possible sensors, is identified through an AE-based sensor validity index ( S V I A E ). Then, the data reconstruction is given from the AE structure for the identified faulty sensor in order to force the faulty data back to its normal conditions. Second, an experiment in the TMS of a D-subway station in Seoul was conducted to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over some other common methods. Furthermore, several performance metrics were used for comparison. Finally, the response of the fault-tolerant ventilation control system given by the AE-based reconstructed data is assessed in terms of the ventilation electricity demand and the commuters\u2019 health risk. Then, this method is finally compared with the response given by a faulty sensor. 1.1 Literature review The accelerated urbanization and industrialization over the past few years have exposed cities and their infrastructures to several difficulties including energy shortage, climate change, heavy traffic conditions, and social predicaments (Zhu, Li, & Feng, 2019). For these reasons, smart cities have been promoted by media channels as an effort to handle the above-mentioned issues through different techniques such as supply chain forecasting, security planning, continuous monitoring, and early warning systems (Din, Guizani, Rodrigues, Hassan, & Korotaev, 2019; Kummitha & Crutzen, 2017; Li, Loy-benitez et al., 2019). To this end, the introduction of information communication technology (ICT) and up-to-date technologies as machine learning and internet of things (IoT) have become increasingly popular tools for the development of smart cities (Bouzguenda, Alalouch, & Fava, 2019; Din et al., 2019). Most of these techniques have been widely implemented to industrial processes; however, the applicability of modern techniques to environmental systems is still in infancy stage (Yu, Yoo, Jang, Park, & Kim, 2018; Zhao, 2018; Zhao, Sun, & Jin, 2018). One example of emerging environmental systems is the subway transportation system which plays a crucial role in modern society by addressing ambient air pollution, traffic overcrowding, and energy efficiency (Li, Loy-benitez et al., 2019). Li, Liu et al. (2019) demonstrated that the expansion of subway systems in a megacity as Beijing improved the ambient air quality by two percent from 2008 to 2016 (Li, Liu, Purevjav, & Yang, 2019). On the other hand, IAQ in the context of human-building interaction (HBI) of subway stations has attracted considerable attention due to adverse and oxidative effects on public health (Liu et al., 2019; Moreno et al., 2017). Accordingly, the ventilation energy demand and the IAQ level are conflicting aspects that have been investigated to improve the subway environment while reducing the energy consumption as an effort to achieve a sustainable balance (Liu et al., 2019). Along with the expansion of these transportation systems, the research community has extended its scope considering the rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) and mathematical techniques to the applicability on the subway IAQ regulation. Consequently, numerous investigations have mainly addressed the modeling, control, prediction, and monitoring of IAQ in subway environments; few of them are summarized in Table 1 . The development of sustainable smart cities implies that these cities are able to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own requirements (Bouzguenda et al., 2019; Ifaei, Karbassi, Lee, & Yoo, 2017). Nevertheless, adding smartness to the city does not always indicate resilience, resulting in a shortage of meeting present needs. Zhu et al. (2019) developed a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) method to determine the relationship between smartness and resilience of the cities; concluding that the resilience of smart cities is still at a low level. Then, it was recommended improvements in several aspects including infrastructure, economy, and stakeholders\u2019 collaboration (Zhu et al., 2019). Under the scope of smart continuous monitoring, this paper discusses the application of an unsupervised machine learning technique in a subway space to autonomously detect, identify and reconstruct faulty IAQ sensors satisfying both needs: sustainability and resilience. The sustainability aspect is addressed by the effects of correcting control actions of the ventilation system under faulty-sensors scenarios, measured by ventilation energy demand and IAQ level. Additionally, the resilient aspect is accounted in the capability of the proposed method to autonomously absorb the negative impact of the faulty sensors, adapt to overcome disruption, and restore the ventilation system according to sensor reconstruction. 2 Preliminaries 2.1 Conventional IAQ monitoring system in the D-subway station The selected D-subway station is an underground facility located on line 3 of the Seoul metro system. The infrastructure of the station consists of one level maintained on the surface (namely concourse), and two main underground levels. The first underground level is the waiting room located approximately 10\u202fm below the surface level. The second underground level is the subway platform, which is located in the furthest part of the station, approximately 24\u202fm from the surface. The underground platform is a facing type, in which the people who want to go in one direction face the people who want to go in the opposite direction, with the track between them. Approximately 2,000 commuters per hour transit through the station on a regular basis. The ventilation system in the D-subway station consists of an inverter frequency apparatus that regulates the air delivery by altering the frequency to power the ventilation fans at a desired torque and speed (Quan, Kim, & Kim, 2018). This station counts with a total of four ventilation units with similar characteristics, two are located in the waiting room, while the other two are located on the underground platform. The characteristics of the ventilation system are shown in Table 2 . The volume of the deepest level of this facility is approximately 19,500\u202fm3. Therefore, considering the air delivery at the maximum capacity (60\u202fHz), the indoor air can be renewed every 0.33\u202fh (20\u202fmin); on the contrary, at the minimum capacity of the ventilation system (20\u202fHz), the indoor air can be renewed every 0.98\u202fh (59\u202fmin). The TMS installed in the underground platform monitors several variables, including NO, NO2, NOX, PM10, PM2.5, CO, CO2, temperature, and humidity, thus providing useful information for the inverter frequency operation. When the IAQ falls below certain specifications, the fan speed of the ventilation system is increased to a high level. Therefore, providing accurate information to the inverter frequency is essential in the IAQ management of the D-subway station. The conventional IAQ monitoring system of the D-subway station is depicted in Fig. 1 . Here, the TMS captures and sends the IAQ variables signal to the inverter frequency; then, the inverter regulates the air delivery by adjusting the ventilation fan speed. However, in some cases, aggressive conditions surrounding the sensors may corrupt the IAQ signals sent by the TMS to the inverter frequency, often causing misinterpretation of the information. When this happens, corrective actions of the ventilation system are misplaced, no longer resulting in effective IAQ regulation. 2.2 Autoencoder (AE) An AE model is an unsupervised learning technique for feature extraction, as described in several studies (Liou, Cheng, Liou, & Liou, 2014; Zhao, 2018). The AE structure consists of two parts, the encoder, and the decoder. The encoder learns a feature representation from the original data through nonlinear mapping; normally, this is used for dimensionality reduction purposes (i.e. compression). On the other hand, the so-called sparse AE structures have been applied in fault detection schemas in previous studies (Lu, Wang, Qin, & Ma, 2017; Yan et al., 2016). Following, the decoder reconstructs a feature vector using a nonlinear mapping. An AE structure is illustrated in Fig. 2 . Given an input vector x where x ∈ R d , the encoder represents a function f ( x ) that maps the input vector to a hidden representation h ∈ R d ' , defined by Eq. (1): (1) h = f ( x ) = S f ( W x + b ) , where W is a weight matrix with d ' × d dimensions and b is a bias vector where b ∈ R d ' . The function S f is a nonlinear activation function; in this study, a sigmoid function is utilized, defined as S f ( x ) = 1 / ( 1 + e − x ) . The role of the decoder is to force the AE structure to select the best representation that reconstructs the input vector as accurately as possible. Then a function g is defined to map the hidden representation back to reconstruction z, as shown in Eq. (2): (2) z = g ( h ) = S g ( W ' h + b ' ) , where the bias vector is represented by b ' where b ' ∈ R d , and a constraint for the weight matrix is defined as W ' = W T with dimensions d × d ' . The AE training procedure consists of optimizing an objective function, which is the sum of all the reconstruction errors between the input x and the reconstruction z. The optimization is then used to find parameters θ = { W , b , W ' , b ' } . The objective function O A E is shown in Eq. (3): (3) O A E ( θ ) = ∑ x ∈ D L ( x , g ( f ( x ) ) ) , where L is the reconstruction error. In this study, the mean squared error (MSE) is utilized as the reconstruction error as shown in Eq. (4). (4) L ( x , z ) = ∑ i = 1 n ( x i − z i ) 2 n Finally, the objective function minimization is conducted through optimization methods such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD), or Adam. The AE structure is designed to convert the inputs into outputs with the least possible distortion. The main difference between AE and other typical methods for reconstruction is that the AE structure implements a nonlinear dimensional reduction/sparsity and feature representation utilizing nonlinear activation functions. 3 Materials and methods 3.1 Development of an AE-based sensor self-validation model Rapid faulty measurements detection, correct identification of the faulty sensor, and accurate fault sensor reconstruction are the most important aspects of efficient monitoring operation (Wang & Chen, 2004). These aspects describe the procedure to automatically reconstruct the abnormal data, forcing it to acquire a regular behavior (Wang & Chen, 2004; Yoo, Villez, Lee, Van Hulle, & Vanrolleghem, 2006). Fig. 3 depicts the monitoring procedure proposed in this study to train and validate an AE model. The procedure is divided into two parts: 1) the offline modeling, and 2) the online monitoring. The offline modeling consists of training the AE model with data at normal operating conditions. Then, Rosner\u2019s test is conducted to detect and remove outliers. The input data is propagated through the AE model, in which the hidden representation and the final activation are obtained. The objective of the offline modeling is to determine the confidence limits for monitoring. The statistic to be monitored is the squared prediction error (SPE), and it is estimated with a kernel density estimation (KDE) with a confidence level of 99%. The online monitoring consists of evaluating the validation dataset or new data points to detect faults, identify faulty sensors via an AE-based sensor validity index (SVIAE), and fault reconstruction through the AE architecture. The accuracy of the sensors is essential to effectively monitor and control an IAQ system, especially for decision-making about control actions supported by online measurements (Yoo et al., 2006). Several schemas have been applied for sensor validation for IAQ monitoring in subway stations, including PCA (Liu et al., 2012), ICA (Kim et al., 2013), and DICA (Kim et al., 2014), all of which need an additional iterative step for their reconstruction of faulty sensors, making their algorithms computationally expensive. In contrast, the autonomous reconstruction of faulty sensors is a unique asset that the AE method provides. In Table 3 , all of these methods are compared based on their statistical assumptions. Therefore, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the AE-based sensor validation schema, we compared these methods. For the fairness of the analysis, the branch methods (PCA, ICA, and DICA) utilized three principal components, as well as independent components. The theoretical background of these methods and their applications in monitoring procedures can be found in multiple references (Burgas, Melendez, & Colomer, 2014; Huang & Yan, 2015; Lee, Yoo, & Lee, 2004). Fig. 4 (a) illustrates the variation of all the variables during a 31 days data collection period, consisting of 744 samples. Preliminary analyses were conducted to assess the nonlinear behavior of the IAQ data throughout the study interval. Fig. 4(b) shows the normality plot for the indoor PM10 concentration, wherein two tails diverge from normality, indicating a non-Gaussian behavior. Fig. 4(c) depicts the autocorrelation function of the indoor PM10 concentration, indicating that the data are strongly correlated with previous measurements. Thus, the data show clear signs of dynamism and accumulation of PM10 concentration in the platform. These analyses revealed that the IAQ system is indeed complex and it needs to be treated with nonlinear methods to capture its intrinsic features. 3.1.1 Sensor fault detection Test statistics are widely used to detect sensor faults in process monitoring. The S P E is utilized for detecting noise and anomalous variations; this statistic is constructed based on the residual subspace (Jackson, Mudholkar, Jackson, & Mudholkar, 2018). Analytically, when a new sample is mapped to a hidden representation in the AE model and follows the S P E statistic, it is considered to be a normal operating observation, otherwise, it is considered a faulty observation. The S P E statistic is based on the reconstruction error between the input x and the reconstructed vector z. The statistic is formulated as shown in Eq. (5). (5) S P E = e T e = ( x − g ( f ( x ) ) ) T ( x − g ( f ( x ) ) ) Here, the S P E is able to show the incorrect information of all the process variables. Moreover, this statistic describes the degree of deviation between the process and the statistical model. To detect faulty observations in an online framework, it is necessary to predefine some confidence limits. Since the feature representations in AE-based monitoring do not follow a Gaussian distribution, it is necessary to determine the confidence limits via K D E . The K D E is a non-parametric way to estimate the probability density function of a random variable (Parzen, 1962). For example, considering the process data x = ( x 1 , x 2 , ... , x m ) as an independent and identically distributed sample with an unidentified probability density function f ( x ) ; then, the main interest is to estimate the shape of the function f . The K D E follows the following equation: (6) f ( x ) = 1 m σ ∑ i = 1 m K x − x i σ , where x is the analyzed data point, x i is an observation point from the dataset, σ represents the width of the window, m is the number of observations, and K is the kernel function from which the standard normal density function is typically selected. Then, the K D E is applied to estimate the density function of the S P E values. The confidence limit ( S P E α ) is defined by taking the quantile α = 0.01 from its own probability density estimator. After this analytical framework is established and a new sample is mapped by the AE model. If the S P E values exceed the predefined S P E α , the observations are deemed abnormal; otherwise, the observations are correct. To measure the effectiveness of the fault detection, a detection rate ( D R ) is applied, defined by Eq. (7). (7) D R ( % ) = Number of detected faults Number of given faults × 100 % 3.1.2 Sensor fault identification Once the faulty measurement is detected, the next step is to identify the faulty sensor which is responsible for causing the abnormal measurement. Given a normal sensor, a fault direction represents the sensor that is causing the anomaly; then, a faulty vector can be expressed as follows: (8) x ˜ = x + f ξ i where x is the part of the normal measurements, f is the fault size, and ξi represents the fault direction denoted by a unit vector. Dunia, Qin, Edgar, and McAvoy (2004) introduced the concept of the SVI for the investigation of faulty sensors (Dunia et al., 2004). The S V I A E is proposed to identify the faulty sensor among all the possible sensors by using the AE model as the reconstruction method. The S V I A E is described as follows: (9) S V I A E k = S P E ( x ( t ) k * ) S P E ( x ( t ) ) , where S P E ( x ( t ) ) and S P E ( x ( t ) k * ) are the S P E vectors of the original sample vector x ( t ) and the reconstructed vector x ( t ) k * by the AE model, respectively, and k is the number of variables (Chen & Lan, 2010; Wang & Chen, 2004). The main idea of the identification is to trace and evaluate the AE-reconstruction approach by the utilization of the SPE variation, to then determine whether the kth sensor is responsible for the failure. In the beginning, it is assumed that all of the sensors are faulty; then, if the i th variable of the original sample x is an actual faulty source and k ≠ i , this means that the fault direction was not selected properly. Therefore, the S P E ( x ( t ) k * ) does not show a considerable variation and the S V I A E k approximates to the unity. Conversely, if a faulty sensor is properly identified, a significant reduction is likely to occur in the S P E ( x ( t ) k * ) and then the S V I A E k tends to zero (Kim et al., 2013; Navi, Meskin, & Davoodi, 2018). Past studies have recommended a value of 0.5 as a confidence limit (Kim et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2012; Wang & Chen, 2004). If the S V I A E k value is less than 0.5; then, it is assumed that the considered sensor in the direction of the failure. On the other hand, sensors with values greater than the confidence limit are not considered to be in the direction of the failure. 3.1.3 Sensor fault reconstruction After identifying the faulty sensor, it is necessary to reconstruct the faulty data to eliminate the abnormal condition. This procedure consists of restoring normal conditions by applying a counteraction in the faulty signals (Yoo et al., 2006). Contrary to the more widely implemented methods (PCA, ICA, and DICA), the AE structure does not require iterative algorithms (Kim et al., 2014; Wang & Chen, 2004). As explained in Section 2.2, data reconstruction by the AE model is possible by its correct design and its feedback propagation, similar to a shallow neural network with an input layer, an output layer, and a hidden layer fully connecting those layers (Park et al., 2018; Yan et al., 2016). Several metrics to assess the AE reconstruction performance are suggested, including the root mean squared error (RMSE), the mean absolute percent error (MAPE), and the coefficient of determination (R2). These metrics are expressed as: (10) R M S E = 1 m ∑ i = 1 m ( x i − z i ) 2 (11) M A P E = 1 m ∑ i = 1 m x i − z i x i (12) R 2 = 1 − ∑ i = 1 m ( x i − z i ) 2 ∑ i = 1 m ( x i − x ¯ ) 2 , where x i is a data point in the input data, z i is the reconstructed data, and m is the number of samples. Using these performance metrics, low values represent an effective reconstruction performance. 3.2 Sustainable monitoring step-by-step with an AE-based self-reconstructed model To validate the AE-based monitoring procedure presented in the previous sections, we conducted experiments in the D-subway station. The TMS measured a total of nine variables collected in hourly increments. The AE-based monitoring followed these steps: Step 1 Obtain normal sensor operation data of the TMS in the D-subway station Step 2 Normalize the data for each variable utilizing their mean and standard deviation Step 3 Train the AE offline model using the Adam optimizer Step 4 Acquire the reconstruction of the input z = g ( f ( x ) ) from the AE model Step 5 Construct the SPE statistic based on the normal sensor operation data Step 6 Define the confidence limit S P E α by the KDE Step 7 Compute the monitoring statistic SPE of the new data in the residual space Step 8 Determine whether a fault occurs by comparing the S P E α with the new SPE values Further, for the online monitoring phase, an artificial faulty signal is introduced to the test dataset to be propagated through the AE model. Then, the AE-based sensor self-validation procedure is conducted by following the framework consisting of fault detection, faulty sensor identification, and sensor fault reconstruction. The metrics obtained from this schema are compared by PCA, ICA, and DICA. Finally, after mathematical modeling, the reconstructed and faulty data are introduced to the ventilation control system to understand the responses and the consequences of not reconstructing the faulty data. For comprehensive purposes, Fig. 5 illustrates the schematic of the fault-tolerant control loop in the D-subway station by means of the AE-based sensor self-validation schema for the online monitoring phase. Additional evaluations were conducted by the response of the faulty and reconstructed data in the ventilation control system through ventilation energy consumption, and a health risk assessment using the comprehensive indoor air quality index (CIAI) suggested by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of the U.S. Computationally, the AE structure was modeled using the Keras deep-learning library (Vidnerová & Neruda, 2017). The architecture consists of three layers: the encoder (input) layer which has nine neurons that represent each variable of the TMS; the hidden representation layer which has a sparse encoding dimension of 100 neurons; and the decoder (output) layer which has nine neurons where the reconstructed data are stored. The layers are fully connected and the activation function between the layers is the sigmoid function. For the compilation step, the selected optimizer is Adam. 3.2.1 Faulty data preparation A total of 744 samples were separated into a training set (70%), and the remaining 30% for the test set. The training set with 521 samples was normalized by each variable with zero mean and unit variance. Considering that selecting the proportions for splitting the dataset may affect the performance of any machine learning problem due to the occurrence of high variability in the parameter estimations (Afendras & Markatou, 2015). In this study, the dataset split was based in a thumb rule as taken in several past investigations (Hwangbo, Nam, Heo, & Yoo, 2019; Li, Loy-Benitez, Nam et al., 2019). The training set is used for offline modeling, meaning that these measurements are on normal operational conditions. On the contrary, the test set is used to validate the AE model in the online monitoring phase; therefore, the measurements of this dataset are corrupted. A variety of sensor failures can occur, the most typical include bias failure, complete failure, drifting failure, and precision degradation. Fig. S1 of the Supplementary information (SI) depicts the behavior of each sensor failure. The test set was prepared with the introduction of an artificial bias failure from the 100th to the 223rd sample of the PM10 sensor. Several bias magnitudes were applied and consisted of adding 3, 2, and 1 times the average concentration of the PM10; on the other hand, the lowest magnitude corresponds to the subtraction of 0.3 times the average of the PM10 measurements. These magnitudes were equal to 180, 120, 60, and 18\u202fμg/m3, respectively; moreover, Fig. S2 illustrates the introduction of the artificial faulty observations to the test set. Finally, the prepared test set was normalized according to the parameters of the training set. 3.2.2 Sustainability evaluation of the fault-tolerant ventilation control system Considering the increasing energy demand worldwide and its impacts on the environment, it is important to find innovative solutions for energy-efficient buildings. The ventilation system plays a particularly important role in an entire building\u2019s energy consumption and is related to human health risk exposure (Chenari, Dias Carrilho, & Gameiro da Silva, 2016). The sustainability aspect in D-subway IAQ monitoring consists of finding a balance between energy consumption and an adequate IAQ level. To demonstrate the fault-tolerant assets of the AE-based sensor self-validation method over the ventilation control system, we defined two counter-scenarios, one with the highest bias magnitude (180\u202fμg/m3) and the other with the lowest magnitude (18\u202fμg/m3). As an FTC strategy, the AE-based sensor self-validation method is proposed to recover ventilation control in the presence of multiple fault levels (Li, Luo et al., 2019; Liu & Shi, 2013). Following the highest fault signal, the ventilation control system misinterprets the measurement, assuming that the indoor space is highly contaminated; therefore, the ventilation fan speed is likely to be set at its maximum capacity, resulting in energy waste. Conversely, at the lowest fault signal, the contaminant concentration is underestimated compared to the real one; therefore, the ventilation system sets a low fan speed, resulting in a deterioration of the IAQ level. Loy-Benitez et al. (2018) suggested a mathematical model that describes the relationship between the ventilation fan speed and the PM10 concentration in the D-subway station (Loy-Benitez et al., 2018). This relationship was obtained by a data-based output-error (OE) technique, expressed as a first-order plus time delay (FOPTD) model represented by the transfer function given by Eq. (12). (13) G p = − 1.2127 0.0168 s + 1 exp ( − 0.063 s ) In this study, three total ventilation systems were tested according to the transfer function (Gp), utilizing the faulty and reconstructed data. Then, two evaluation indices associated with ventilation energy and public health were used for assessing the fault-tolerance performance of the ventilation systems under the faulty and reconstructed data. Since the ventilation systems represent the highest potential for energy savings in a building, energy consumption was selected as the first performance index (Yang et al., 2014). Liu et al. (Liu, Kang et al., 2013) proposed a third-order polynomial equation that relates energy consumption and the ventilation inverter frequency in the D-subway station, as shown in Eq. (13). (14) E n e r g y C o n s u m p t i o n ( k W h ) = 0.0007 × H z 3 − 0.046 × H z 2 + 2.01 × H z + 8.8 The second performance index was the CIAI, which plays an important role in informing commuters about the indoor air state according to the concentration of an indoor pollutant (Kim et al., 2015). Each ventilation system given by G p grants different responses in the indoor PM10 concentration that trace the available levels of concern: good, moderate, unhealthy for sensitive groups, unhealthy, very unhealthy, and hazardous. The CIAI value for an indoor pollutant is represented as: (15) CIAI = I H I − I L O B P H I − B P L O ( C P − B P L O ) + I L O , where C P is the concentration of the air pollutant, B P L O and B P H I are the concentration breakpoints of the health concern levels, and I L O and I H I are the index breakpoints of each health concern level (Kim et al., 2014; Loy-Benitez, Vilela, Li, & Yoo, 2019). Table S1 of the SI shows the specifications of the CIAI. 4 Results and discussion 4.1 AE sensor self-validation for IAQ monitoring Our corroboration of the advantages of the AE-based sensor self-validation model is based on comparisons with PCA, ICA, and DICA for the online monitoring of artificial faulty observations. For this purpose, we defined the parameters of each method and then assessed them with the various metrics described in Section 3.1. To evaluate the fault detection of the AE-based sensor validation model, we used artificial faulty data with different bias magnitudes. The faulty signal started from the 100th sample; therefore, it was expected that after this sample, the SPE values would stay above the confidence limit. Here, the SPE confidence limit for the fault detection was defined with the KDE (SPE0.01\u202f=\u202f0.0116). Fig. 6 illustrates the fault detection performance of the AE-based monitoring at different bias magnitudes. It should be noted that for high-bias magnitudes (180 and 120\u202fμg/m3), the fault detection procedure was capable of capturing all the faulty measurements. For the lower-bias magnitudes (60 and 18\u202fμg/m3), the capability of detecting faults degraded progressively. To assess the superiority of the proposed method, we calculated the differences in the fault detection performance in terms of D R for all the methods, as explained in Table 4 . The AE-based fault detection showed higher D R values than the other conventional methods at different magnitudes of the bias fault, making it evident that the AE-based fault detection procedure is superior to the other conventional methods for the considered case study. This implies that features such as the nonlinearity and dynamism of the multivariate IAQ data are generally captured, even at small magnitudes of bias faults, where the proposed method identified approximately 44% of the faulty signals. The detection performances of the conventional methods are depicted in Figs. S3\u2013S5 in the SI. The faulty sensor was identified by utilizing the S V I A E ; Fig. 7 illustrates the SVIAE plot for each sensor. Notably, after the introduction of the faulty signals in the 100th sample of the PM10 sensor, the S V I A E showed a remarkable decrease under the established limit of 0.5, whereas the remaining sensors tended to maintain their S V I A E close to unity. We measured the AE capability of reconstructing the faulty sensors using the RMSE, MAPE, and R2 metrics; then, we validated the preeminence of this method by comparing it with the conventional methods. Table 5 presents the reconstruction performance metrics for each method. The largest value of R M S E is shown by the DICA-based reconstruction (34.92\u202fμg/m3); the largest values of M A P E are shown by the ICA and DICA methods with 77.19% and 77.17%, respectively. It should be noted that these two methods cannot capture the intrinsic features or characteristic trends of the indoor PM10 concentration. The difference between the PCA and the AE method in all the performance metrics was not significant, which means that PCA can capture certain trends and sequences of the data but cannot establish a model that allows the detection of faulty data due to the complex relationship among all sensors. Further, the PCA method should be understood as an AE-reconstruction method with a linear function as the activation. Fig. 8 illustrates the reconstruction performances for the faulty PM10 sensor with the different methods; the AE-based method shows the most suitable reconstruction in terms of R M S E (15.35\u202fμg/m3). The advantage of the AE-based sensor validation model over the conventional methods is that, in holistic terms, it was able to cope effectively with the nonlinear relationships and autocorrelated components of the IAQ variables, contributing to an accurate model of the normal sensors\u2019 operation. Consequently, the AE-based fault detection performance was superior to the conventional methods; moreover, the faulty sensor identification procedure recognized the fault source immediately, and the reconstruction accurately forced the faulty data to normality. 4.2 AE sensor self-validation for the fault-tolerant ventilation control system and evaluation of commuters\u2019 health risk The objective of this section is to evaluate the consequences of introducing faulty data to the ventilation control system. The sensor reliability plays an important role in ventilation efficiency and the commuters\u2019 health risk. For this purpose, three ventilation systems were tested with the transfer function of the ventilation model. We assessed the response of the ventilation system under biased data with 180\u202fμg/m3 and 18\u202fμg/m3 fault magnitudes and the reconstructed data obtained from the propagation of the biased data with 180\u202fμg/m3 through the AE model (namely AE-based reconstruction data). The ventilation system performance was evaluated in terms of air delivery by the inverter frequency. Fig. 9 shows the IAQ level traced by the CIAI, with a red dashed line that represents the breakpoint of a moderate level of concern. All of the performance metrics are presented in Table 6 . The artificial faulty signal was introduced in the 100th sample; therefore, the inconsistent behavior in the ventilation system was expected to occur at the beginning of the fourth day. Fig. 9(a) shows the response of the ventilation system under biased data with a fault magnitude of 180\u202fμg/m3. Here, the control system interprets the given information as an abrupt increase in the indoor PM10 concentration; consequently, all the efforts are focused on alleviating the IAQ by setting the air delivery at its maximum. It should be noted that after the faulty signal, the inverter frequency remained constant at 60\u202fHz, generating an energy demand of 2,262.10\u202fkW\u202fh/day. Evidently, due to the increased air delivery, the IAQ improved and maintained the CIAI mostly at a good level of concern, with just 88 points that exceeded that breakpoint. The indoor PM10 concentration averaged 29.51\u202fμg/m3 for the analyzed time interval. Fig. 9(b) depicts the response of the ventilation system under biased data with a fault magnitude of 18\u202fμg/m3. Contrary to the previously analyzed scenario, the control system interpreted the faulty information as a good level of indoor PM10 concentration, when the level of the pollutant was actually higher than what was reported. Consequently, the misinterpretation by the ventilation controller allowed low air deliveries with small inverter frequency signals. From this analysis, it would be expected that the IAQ level would deteriorate as the air delivery was diminished when higher air volume was actually needed. In this faulty scenario, the energy demand was 1,873.88\u202fkW\u202fh/day; moreover, the system allowed 198 points to exceed the CIAI moderate concern level breakpoint, reporting an average of 38.28\u202fμg/m3 indoor PM10 concentration. Fig. 9(c) illustrates the response of the ventilation system under the AE-based reconstructed data. The objective of reconstructing the data from faulty sensors is to generate a realistic response based on the remaining correct sensors, enabling the ventilation system to generate proper actions based on reliable and self-validated observations. Here, the energy demand was 2,162.91\u202fkW\u202fh/day, 109 points exceeded the moderate breakpoint in the CIAI assessment, and the reported PM10 concentration averaged 31.21\u202fμg/m3. In terms of energy consumption, the ventilation system under low-biased data with a fault magnitude of 18\u202fμg/m3 showed the lowest daily energy consumption, while that under high-biased data with a magnitude of 180\u202fμg/m3 showed the highest energy consumption. The low-biased case consumed 13% less ventilation energy but it was unable to provide the necessary ventilation to alleviate the IAQ conditions. The high-biased case consumed 4% more energy than the AE-based reconstruction method, representing an energy waste since the air delivered exceeded that necessary to maintain the IAQ at a good level. In terms of health risk assessment, the ventilation system under high-biased data showed a good IAQ level, whereas the low-bias ventilation system showed the poorest IAQ level. The ventilation system response from the AE-based reconstructed data produced an intermediate-level IAQ. On the other hand, in the context of sustainable ventilation in buildings, finding the best balance between the IAQ level and energy consumption by the ventilation systems have represented a challenge in the development of smart public infrastructures (Honarvar & Sami, 2018; Liu et al., 2017). AE-based sensor self-validation through data reconstruction from faulty sensor signals has been shown to achieve just such a balance. The current energy cost in South Korea is 0.075 USD/kWh (Loy-Benitez et al., 2018). Following the trend of high-bias faulty sensors (magnitude of 180\u202fμg/m3), the total daily cost of energy is 169.66 USD. Considering a ratio of 1.7\u202fkg CO2/kWh, this ventilation system is likely to contribute approximately 3,845.6\u202fkg of CO2 to the atmosphere on a daily basis (Weisser, 2007). Thus, high fault magnitudes may represent a significant impact on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and anthropogenic climate change. Conversely, low-fault magnitude systems consume less energy but they may allow the deterioration of IAQ in underground spaces, since the faulty sensors are not able to capture actual measurements of external factors that can significantly contaminate indoor spaces, including so-called yellow storms (airborne dust from China), seasonality, and time-variant disturbances (Chung & Yoon, 1996; Loy-Benitez et al., 2018). The AE-based sensor self-validation schema generates a fault-tolerant ventilation system with a realistic response when a sensor starts deteriorating, taking the best corrective action to alleviate the IAQ in an underground facility. The response of an AE-controlled underground subway ventilation system to the reconstructed data finds the best balance between energy consumption and commuters\u2019 health risk. Thus, the problem of energy wastage is tackled as such systems consume approximately 162.22 USD in energy every day, 4% less than ventilation systems with high fault magnitudes. The proposed AE method saves approximately 89\u202fh of moderate PM10 exposure to the commuters in the D-subway station; moreover, the average indoor PM10 concentration is decreased by approximately 18.47% in comparison to lowest-fault magnitude ventilation systems. For purposes of summarizing the FTC performance, Fig. S6 illustrates the existing relationship between the energy consumption and the average PM10 concentration resulting from faulty IAQ data at different levels, and the proposed AE-based reconstruction method, demonstrating that our proposed schema shows an evident balance among the multilevel faulty IAQ signals. Therefore, the AE-based sensor self-validation method represents a sustainable solution for the sensor reliability problem in IAQ monitoring, providing a fault-tolerant ventilation system that finds a sustainable balance between energy consumption and the health risk to the commuters in subway stations. 5 Conclusions and future work We have developed an AE-based sensor self-validation monitoring and fault-tolerant ventilation control system to detect, identify, and reconstruct faulty sensors in an underground transportation facility. The main contribution of this study is the development of an AE-based sensor self-validation technique for increasing sensor reliability when it decays due to continuous exposure to hostile underground environments. Our results show that the AE-based sensor validation method outperformed the conventional methods (PCA, ICA, and DICA) when detecting, identifying, and reconstructing faulty sensors. For low-bias and high-bias faults, the AE-based method could detect 44%\u2013100% of the faults; compared to the DICA, the AE method\u2019s reconstruction of the faulty sensors was improved by 31%. With the proposed AE-based method, about 4% less energy was used and the average PM10 level was decreased by 18.47%. Moreover, the AE-based reconstructed sensors allowed the ventilation system to be fault-tolerant, showing a sustainable balance between ventilation energy consumption and health risk level when taking appropriate control actions on the ventilation system. However, we consider the necessity of further investigations related to the improvement of the AE architectures, since the assumption of fixed hyperparameters for the networks may promote decay in the optimization procedure, showing a local-minima problem. Certain techniques must be implemented to get the most of these neural models to obtain a realistic approximation to the normal operating conditions of the sensors, such as callbacks, batch normalization, and hyperparameter optimization.

        "dc:description": "Sensors providing measurements for monitoring and control of indoor air quality (IAQ) are key components of the ventilation systems in subway stations. However, faulty sensors due to harsh ambient conditions may deliver incorrect information triggering misinterpretation; causing energy waste or IAQ deterioration. This paper presents a holistic online framework for sensor self-validation in a subway station based on a sparse autoencoder (AE) architecture. The sensor self-validation procedure consists of sensor fault detection, faulty sensor identification, and faulty sensor reconstruction. First, the AE-based detection rate between 44% and 100%. Then, the faulty sensor identification was conducted through an AE-sensor validity index (SVIAE ). The faulty sensor reconstruction was conducted by the AE structure and evaluated with several performance metrics. Finally, the sustainability and fault-tolerance aspects of this framework were verified through mathematical modeling of the ventilation system; showing the effects of the faulty and reconstructed sensors on energy consumption and public health.",
