Demand response (DR) is widely recognized as an important mechanism in the Australian electricity market, though large-scale uptake in commercial buildings is yet to occur, in part due to the difficulty of characterising the resource. This paper describes a bottom-up physics-based approach to characterise the DR potential of three types of commercial buildings (schools, offices, and data centres) under a global set-point temperature offset strategy. Representative models are calibrated with energy meter data and parametric analysis is used to assess sensitivity to different building, operating and system parameters. Parametric equations are provided for relative DR potentials as functions of temperature and time of day. School buildings were found to have the highest relative DR potential (∼40\u201345%) for ambient temperatures over 30 °C, followed by data centres (∼20\u201330%) and offices (∼20%). Location has the strongest relative influence for school and office buildings and equipment energy intensity for data centres. The Australia-wide combined DR potential for school, office and data centres is estimated to be between 551 and 647 MW. Office buildings have the highest aggregate potential at between 1.5 and 1.7 times that of school buildings and between 9 and 11 times that of data centres. Keywords Demand response HVAC, commercial buildings Setpoint adjustment Energy flexibility Data availability Data will be made available on request. 1 Introduction The increasing penetration of renewable energy systems with intermittent and fluctuating power generation is leading to an increased importance of flexible demand that is adjusted to match the available generated power [1]. Various grid ancillary services (AS) (e.g., frequency and voltage control, standing, spinning and operating reserves, emergency control actions, and grid loss compensation) are in place to support power grid operation and absorb renewable-related disruptions. However, the growing need for AS has seen Demand Response (DR) as a means of load shedding or shifting evolve as a potentially low-cost alternative for grid flexibility in place of conventional fast-ramping generation resources [2]. DR is recognized as one of the most feasible solutions to allow more penetration of intermittent renewable energy generation in bulk electric power systems [3,4]. Over the last few years, significant attention has been paid to the assessment of DR potential, specifically at peak network demand periods [5\u20139]) as well as at other times [10\u201312]. To date, many literature focused on assessing DR through modulating HVAC load [13\u201316], lighting [17\u201319] and plug-loads [20\u201322]. DR can be divided into two types; i) load shedding, which aims to limit the demand during peak load periods, and ii) load shifting strategies that are used to shift the demand from peak periods to off-peak periods are predominantly used to control the end-use loads in residential and commercial buildings. In the residential sector, load shifting strategies such as scheduling smart home appliances and modulating air-conditioning (a/c) loads are becoming more sophisticated with state-of-the-art supervisory control and optimization algorithms [23]. Aggregated load modelling and control, especially for thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) such as a/c systems, has emerged as one of the most feasible ways to provide various DR services, such as frequency regulation and peak load reduction in residential buildings [16,24\u201329]. However, in contrast with the large commercial loads used for spinning reserve or peak shaving, each of these TCLs is relatively small, requiring a significant investment in communications to aggregate enough devices to produce a large controllable grid resource [30]. The commercial building sector is responsible for 25% and 38% of total electricity use in Australia [31] and the U.S.A. [32], respectively. It is estimated that a/c DR through setpoint offset strategies alone could reduce peak loads on the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) by 5.8%. or 1.2 GW [33]. Individual commercial buildings with large power demand are often prioritized by the utilities and system operators since comparatively less investment is required in communication and performance verification and billing procedures are simpler [30]. HVAC-related loads in commercial buildings are an excellent potential DR resource due to their high proportion of the overall load, which is often more than one-third of the total power and single-point metering and control access through the Building Management System (BMS). [34]. Moreover, these loads are inherently flexible to a certain extent due to the effective thermal storage capacity in the buildings and HVAC plant, which also enables the execution of dynamic electricity pricing schemes in the context of the smart grid [35,36]. However, unlike residential buildings, commercial buildings are more diverse in terms of their building fabric, equipment and use. Significant challenges to realising commercial building HVAC DR arise due to the complex, nontrivial thermodynamic and hydrodynamic coupling between the individual cooling and heating loads and a large number of state variables [30]. In addition, interaction effects with other equipment may occur. This makes it difficult to predict the DR potential using a first-principles model [37]. These challenges are discussed further below in the context of previous studies. 1.1 Modelling approaches Various HVAC-based DR strategies have been considered in existing studies [13,38\u201341]. The most commonly applied include global temperature adjustment (GTA), pre-cooling, duct static pressure increase, fan variable frequency drive (FVD) limit, boiler lockout, fan-coil unit off and chiller demand limiting. Of these, GTA is the most widely studied with its main advantage being that the space temperature set-points for an entire facility can be adjusted with a single command [13].Whilst some other HVAC-related DR strategies such as modifying the duct static pressure set-point and disengaging chiller compressor stages only leverage the response of the HVAC control system, a GTA strategy coupled with pre-cooling (using a lower set-point temperature at times of lower energy price or demand) leverages the thermal storage in the building and HVAC system [30]. Other HVAC DR control strategies such as shutting down chiller units for a certain amount of time, may support fast DR but may negatively affect the system stability or comfort. For example, a simulation study conducted by Mathieu, et al. [37] demonstrated that serious hydraulic imbalance could occur after turning off part of the chillers, and uneven indoor air temperature can occur in individual air-conditioned spaces. However, Chen, et al. [42] showed that the addition of a supplementary chilled water storage tank of suitable capacity allowed the chiller to be shut down for a certain time when the tank discharged to supply the cooling load. The potential of an HVAC-based DR strategy largely depends on the building\u2019s thermo-hydraulic behaviour, control systems, the interaction between primary and secondary loops of HVAC systems, and communication with external weather conditions [43,44]. Significant efforts have been made to characterize the DR potential of different commercial building typologies, climates, and HVAC system operational modes and control mechanisms. Many DR-related studies (e.g., [6,38,45,46]) have been conducted in different regions. Table 1 summarises these works in terms of the analysis approach used to characterise the overall DR potential, the region and building types studied, and the DR strategies employed. An estimate of the range of calculated DR potential values is also given. The analysis approach has been characterised according to the hierarchy shown in Fig. 1 . Three main approaches are defined: i) bottom-up modelling, ii) top-down modelling, and iii) experimental studies. Bottom-up modelling involves estimation of the DR potential of a collection of buildings by aggregating the estimates made from detailed modelling of individual buildings or building types. Bottom-up methods can be further divided into three sub-categories: physics based, data-driven and hybrid. Bottom-up physical methods solve systems of equations that model the energy and mass transport processes occurring in the building-HVAC-environment system. These methods allow detailed analysis of the influence of different design and operating parameters on the load flexibility. Physical methods can be classified as either detailed (high fidelity) models (B) or simplified models (C). The high fidelity approaches typically employ sophisticated modelling tools such as EnergyPlus [47], TRNSYS [48] or IDA-ICE [49] while the simplified engineering approaches rely on solving reduced-order model such as an energy balance equation, for example as specified in ISO 13790 [50]. Typical simplified engineering models include the degree day method [51], the equivalent full load hours method [52], bin method [53,54], and resistance\u2013capacitance (RC) hourly method [55,56]. These models often suffer from poor predictive accuracy due to the requirement for multiple simplifying assumptions [57]. Bottom-up data-driven (i.e., black-box) approaches (D) include regression [51,58], neural network [59\u201361] or conditional demand-based analysis [61,62]. Despite the beneficial characteristic of high prediction accuracy, these approaches are mostly suitable for simpler analytical building HVAC models, and aggregated load modelling and control to evaluate D.R. strategies. One significant issue is that the available historical datasets used to train the models may be comprised of relatively narrow parameter ranges and so the models are not exposed to the full range of possible operating states. To address this issue some data-driven approaches also incorporate physical system knowledge (A). For example, the assessment study conducted by Yin, et al. [13] involved both linear regression and detailed physics-based models to quantify flexibility of commercial and residential loads for DR. These types of analysis are referred to as hybrid-physics (i.e., grey-box) methods. Top-down modelling approaches are necessarily data-driven since the detailed heat transfer processes occurring within a given building are not modelled. However, they still employ models informed by data to estimate aggregate processes. For example, some studies, e.g., [63\u201366] have used socio-economic factors such as energy prices, population size and weather conditions to model aggregated energy use to the urban, state, regional, or national scale, by considering a group of buildings as a single energy entity. These types of models typically rely on aggregate end-use functions that link energy demand and underlying socio-economic factors. The top-down modelling approaches derived using data-driven methods can be categorized as econometric (E), technological (F), and physical (G) [67]. The econometric models involve statistical and mathematical relationships based on economic theory to estimate aggregated energy. Technological models explicitly account for technological characteristics of the building stock, such as appliance saturation trends or adherence to building codes. Physical top-down models typically employ regression models to estimate aggregate energy consumption integrated with climatic variations and evaluate the relationship between these two variables. Several authors [38,39,68,69] have decided to characterise DR potential through in-situ field studies (H) or controlled lab-based experiments (I) (e.g., field and laboratory tests). Experiments allow testing of the real system response, although they require significant resources to conduct, and the results are more difficult to generalise to other buildings or HVAC systems. By contrast, building simulation models can save considerable resources, and if properly calibrated, they could be up to 30% more accurate than the metered data [70]. Building simulation software offers the opportunity to perform energy assessments across different time intervals without the need for hardware and communication network prototypes. Furthermore, since evaluating savings from DR interventions requires comparisons with a counter-factual (i.e., estimated base building load), it is always necessary to invoke some form of modelling to calibrate DR. Many different approaches can be used to characterise DR, and the selection of a suitable analysis approach depends on the objectives of the study and the available resources. For instance, top-down modelling approaches may be more suitable when the focus is on the broader scale impact of DR across the energy and economic sectors. Bottom-up modelling may be more appropriate when a detailed engineering level evaluation of DR potential is required. Experimental studies are particularly relevant when validating and testing DR control strategies involving building mechanical equipment integrated within the system in the real-world or controlled environment. 1.2 Previous work Studies categorising the HVAC DR potential of buildings in different regions of the world are summarised in Table 1. Most studies involving commercial buildings [13,14,38,39,45,68,69,71,72] have considered office buildings with a few considering institutional buildings such as retail stores, restaurants, school classrooms, auditoriums, gymnasiums, and libraries [38,45]. Many consider a specific region or country and the associated climate(s), with results reported to vary across climates. For instance, Motegi, et al. [38] conducted DR field tests across 28 non-residential (mostly office) buildings in Northern California. They reported the need for further studies to better understand DR potential for various building types and climates. The theoretical DR potentials quantified by Gils [6] for 40 European countries showed variations in load flexibilities for different consumers and climates. They report average DR potential ranges from 7% to 26%. Cai and Braun [45] found that DR potential in small commercial buildings in the U.S. varied from 7.5 to 26 W/m2 depending on location and building type. For example, in hot climates like Miami there were significantly fewer free cooling opportunities and cost saving potential. Among seven building types, the auditorium was identified as the highest and retail and small office buildings were identified as the lowest energy flexibility sectors in Miami. Several studies concentrated on evaluating energy flexibility in buildings considering thermal mass. For instance, Le Dréau and Heiselberg [43] used simulations to assess the energy flexibility of residential buildings with short-term heat storage and different levels of thermal insulation and airtightness. Foteinaki, et al. [40] evaluated the energy flexibility in a low-energy residential building with varying indoor air temperatures and found that the energy use reduction varied between 40% and 87% depending on the characteristics of the building envelope and the HVAC systems. Similarly, Turner, et al. [41] found that 50\u201399% of total annual peak cooling electricity could be shifted from peak period to off-peak period depending on the climate zone, the length of the pre-cooling period and the pre-cooling set point. However, there are few such DR sensitivity analyses studies for larger commercial buildings (those with more than 1000 m2 of total floor area [73]). 1.3 Research scope, motivation, and contribution Based on the above review several areas requiring further work have been identified: \u2022 There are limited studies reporting on the variation of DR potential across different commercial buildings and climates. Given DR potential is strongly influenced by weather, findings from one climate are not directly transferable to another even when normalised against temperature. Further, commercial buildings designed based on the construction codes and practises of individual countries differ in terms of their systems, thermo-hydraulic behaviour and control mechanisms. These factors mean it is necessary to characterise DR potential for different climates, countries and jurisdictions. \u2022 Few studies consider the multi-faceted influence of building envelope, HVAC system and building operating parameters on the DR potential. This is particularly the case for large commercial buildings that typically have a complex structure of HVAC systems comprising chillers, boilers, heating/cooling coils, thermal storage systems, air-handling equipment and air and liquid distribution systems. Although several studies consider the variation of individual design parameter in isolation, a more detailed global sensitivity analysis, including assessing wide-ranging building design and HVAC operational parameters may deliver further insights. \u2022 Only two studies compare DR potential across different commercial building typologies. Comparisons across different typologies helps to understand how different combinations of building thermal dynamics, HVAC equipment and operating characteristics influence the DR performance across different time intervals from annual to sub-hourly frequency. While bottom-up physical detailed high-fidelity models can provide case-specific insights for specific buildings, they can also be applied to representative (archetype-based) buildings. An archetype approach may classify the building stock according to building typologies, size, climate or construction year [74,75], though there is no standard approach and different interpretations of the categories are used. The Australia-wide Building Stock Model (BSM) has three major components: building classification, floorspace estimation, and geospatial referencing [74]. The classification structure developed by BIS Shrapnel to construct a detailed building stock model ties with Building Classes prescribed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), which is based on the primary function of the building. According to the building stock model data [76], Australian non-residential buildings can be divided into nine types: offices, hotels, shopping centres, supermarkets, hospitals, schools, tertiary, public buildings, and law courts. Within this broad categorisation there exists substantial variations in design and usage. Instead of attempting to model all such variations, here a single representative building model was constructed for each of the three categories with parameters selected in such a way as to result in performance representative of the average energy use of buildings in that category, as verified through a validation process. In this paper the DR potential of three types of commercial buildings is assessed across a range of Australian climates through detailed bottom-up physics-based building simulations (B). A global temperature adjustment (GTA) strategy is considered. The simulations are calibrated with energy meter data and used to explore the DR potential of the three building designs with varying operating and system parameters. The specific contributions of this study are: \u2022 Parametric relationships for the fraction and magnitude of DR available are determined as functions of time of day and outdoor temperature for three types of commercial buildings \u2013 schools, offices and data centres. \u2022 The sensitivity of the DR potential to building and HVAC system-related parameters (e.g., global temperature set-point, building fabric, orientation & local shading, glazing, window types, window-wall ratio, internal loads and HVAC system sizing) is assessed. \u2022 State-wide aggregated cooling electricity demand and DR potentials are estimated for each of the three typologies as function of hour of the day and temperature for Australia. \u2022 Recommendations are provided for maximising the potential of DR in commercial buildings, particularly for Australian climates and building designs. The three building types were selected based on an initial assessment which identified these as providing the best combination of overall DR potential and ability to be modelled using a generic framework. Further details are provided in Section 2. Also, this Section provides an overview of three building types and their HVAC system configurations and operating schedules. The remainder of the manuscript is organized as follows: The methodological approach including data sources and simulation details are reported in Section 3. Section 4 presents simulation results and a comparative analysis among three building types. Section 5 summarizes and discusses the main findings of this study and identifies further research opportunities. Lastly, conclusions are drawn in Section 6. 2 Selection and description of building types A range of building types, such as hotels, schools, offices, hospitals, data centres, and retail stores, was considered in the initial assessment. Of these, schools, offices and data centres were chosen for detailed analysis based on the criteria: i) share of energy consumption in commercial buildings in Australia, ii) possessing a well-defined load characteristic, and iii) availability of load profile data for model calibration. These three building typologies provide unique services and have considerably different operating profiles, building designs and equipment. An overview of these buildings in relation to DR potential is discussed below: Retail buildings represent the largest share of energy consumption (61.6 PJ or 36%), followed by standalone office buildings, 1 1 Standalone offices refer to office buildings with an area greater than 1000m2 NLA. which are estimated to share 38.1 PJ (or 23%) of total energy consumption in commercial buildings in 2020 [77]. On the other hand, school buildings are estimated to share 8.8 PJ (5.31%) of energy consumption in commercial buildings in Australia in 2020 [77]. An estimate of the overall energy consumption from data centres in Australia was not found in the Govt. report, but around the world, they were estimated to account for approximately 1.5% of total electricity use in 2011 [78] growing at a rate of 10\u201312% per year [78\u201380]. Data centres may be well-suited for DR due to the flexible nature of their electrical load which is largely comprised of equipment (server) electrical demand and cooling demand and their near continuous operation. A recent study led by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) found that 5% of the load in a data centre can typically be shed in 5 min, and 10% of the load in 15 min through temperature set-point adjustment alone [79]. Based on survey results Wierman, et al. [81] reported that data centres could provide similar flexible demand services as large-scale storage installations. Thus, data centres were selected as a key typology for analysis here. 2.1 Building - HVAC system details The baseline representative building and HVAC system models (detailed in Table 2, Appendix A and Appendix B) for schools, offices, and data centres were constructed as per Energy Efficiency provisions in the NCC of Australia [82] using the specific building classes listed there. Unfortunately, the commercial building baseline study [76] used here for validating the models did not cover data centres. Hence, necessary building stock model data for data centres were collected from Cloudscene [83]. Building specific data inputs (such as internal heat gains related to occupant activity, lights, and electrical equipment) for data centres were gathered from ASHRAE Standard 90.4 2019 Energy Standard for Data Centres [84] (detailed in Appendix C Table C1). The standard operational schedules for a typical school or office building prescribed by the NCC of Australia (detailed in Appendix C Fig. C1) were used while the data centre operational schedule was set according to the ASHRAE Standard 90.4 2019 Energy Standard [84]. The representative building models for schools, offices and data centres were characterized in terms of principal activity, which is the primary business or function carried on within each building. Each zone within the school building comprises a packaged terminal air-conditioner (PTAC) system. The HVAC system in the office building encompasses an air loop (AHU (VAV), heating and cooling coils, and fans), chilled water plant loop (a chiller and pump), condenser loop (a cooling tower and pump), and hot water loop (a gas-fired boiler and pump). Each of the ten zones within the office building is equipped with a dual duct VAV system that provides control over zone temperature by mixing the cold and warm air in various volume combinations. For the data centre, the occupancy, lighting, equipment, heating and cooling operational schedules were set according to ASHRAE standard 90.4 [84] with a wider operating temperature band than for the school and office buildings. The HVAC system consisted of an air loop (an AHU (VAV), heating and cooling coils, and extract and supply fans), primary chilled water loop (a chiller, a chilled water storage tank and a supply pump), secondary chilled water loop (a chiller and a supply pump), condenser loop (a cooling tower and a supply pump), and hot water loop (a gas-fired boiler and a supply pump). A chilled water storage tank is located on the supply side of a primary chilled water loop in parallel with the secondary chiller (Appendix B Fig. B3). Operation is controlled through chiller and storage tank setpoints along with corresponding plant operation schedules. The distribution of cooling load and the timing of storage charging is typically controlled through a Scheduled setpoint manager on the chiller outlet node. Each of the ten zones is equipped with a dual duct VAV system that provides control over zone temperature by mixing the cold and warm air in various volume combinations. 2.1.1 Zone summary Different zones were included in each building model to replicate the range of activities occurring with them. The layouts of the buildings are illustrated in Appendix A (Fig. A1 to Fig. A3). A detailed description is provided in Table C1 (Appendix C). The zones are discussed briefly in the following subsections. The school building comprises six zones: two open classrooms located on the east side and two on the west side of the building and occupying most of the ground and first floors. Two adjacent zones on the ground and first floors represent reception and circulation areas, such as corridors and stairways with lower associated internal loads. The central portion of the ten-storey office building represents general office spaces and meeting rooms and is divided into ten separate zones located on different levels. The canteen space is located on level 1, where occupancy density is higher than adjacent zones. There is a circulation area (e.g., corridors and stairways) adjacent to each office space where internal heat gains from lights and electrical equipment are comparatively low. The data centre is modelled as nine zones: three zones representing common web hosting facilities with 24-hour internal heat gains from equipment and only transient occupancy; three adjacent zones representing circulation areas such as corridors and stairways; two other zones on levels 4 and 5 representing computer server spaces with continuous low to medium internal heat gains from equipment and transient occupancy and one zone on level 6 representing a heavy plant room comprising major HVAC equipment for the building. Two levels of IT equipment (ITE) load density were considered in the representative building for data centres to cover the wide range of IT power density of data centres. While web hosting facilities within a data centre contain heavy IT equipment, server rooms are primarily used for computer spaces. Equipment power density is very high for a web hosting facility compared to computer server spaces (Appendix C Table C1). Building-specific data inputs such as internal heat gains related to occupant activity, lights, and electrical equipment required for simulating building energy performance were specified based on the Energy Efficiency provisions in NCC 2019 of Australia [82] along with ASHRAE 90.4 (Energy Standard for Data Centres) [84] and ASHRAE 90.1 [85]. 3 Methodology 3.1 Overview The methodology used in this study is summarised in Fig. 2 . Building simulations were conducted using EnergyPlus [47], a software widely recognized both in the industry and scientific literature and has been previously validated for building energy studies [86\u201389]. The first step involved collecting three types of data: i) building-specific & HVAC related data comprising information on activity, construction, glazing, façade, lighting, HVAC equipment and system (e.g., chiller performance) and operating schedules based on based on Energy Efficiency provisions as defined in the National Construction Code (NCC) of Australia [82], ii) representative weather data for seven NCC climate zones in Australia as detailed in Table 3, and. iii) representative electricity meter data for three building topologies for five different states of Australia. iv) building model stock data for offices, schools, and data centres. In the second step, building-specific & HVAC related data was loaded into the model and simulations were carried out using representative weather data to determine a baseline building thermal load. This thermal load was then used to size the air-side system components (e.g., supply and return fans, VAV terminals). Then a predictor\u2013corrector technique was applied to calculate the resulting zone temperature for the actual air system capability [90]. The energy plus simulation engine calculated half-hourly periodic steady-state temperatures and heat flows for each zone using maximum and minimum design summer and winter weather conditions and determined heating and cooling capacities required to maintain the heating and cooling temperature set points in each zone. A safety factor or design margin value of 1.1 was used to calculate a design heating and cooling capacity from the maximum cooling load value in each zone so that comfort conditions can be maintained in all but the most extreme weather conditions. The data generated from simulations include latent and sensible heat gains, comfort performance, energy flows, major end-uses and zonal heating, cooling and electricity rate on a 5-mins time interval. Also, an output report was generated, including a demand end-use component summary, HVAC component sizing summary, heating and cooling peak conditions and annual and monthly-basis building utility performance. The representative buildings were designed to provide thermal comfort conditions for occupancy as per ASHRAE standard 55 [91]. In the third step, the energy performance of representative buildings (without any DR events) was evaluated and compared with whole building metered energy consumption data from the National Energy Analytics Research (NEAR) program [92]. Section 3.2 and Section 3.3 provide details of these data and model calibration and validation processes. In the fourth step a parametric analysis was performed to assess the influence of building operating and design parameters on the annual electricity consumption and DR potential. This sensitivity analysis identified which parameters influenced output variation the most and enabled ranking the input variables in order of sensitivity. The analysis method is detailed in Section 3.4. In the fifth step, the DR potential at different times of the day and under different weather conditions was simulated for each building typology. A one-step GTA strategy was used with limits on the allowable internal temperature drifts and ramp rate based on the ASHRAE Standard 55\u20132017 [91]. Section 3.5 provides details of these GTA-based DR events. The method that was followed to establish a parametric relationship between time of the day, outdoor temperature and DR is detailed in Section 3.5.1. Finally, in the sixth step, the state-wide cooling electricity demand and DR potentials from the cooling systems of individual building types were calculated using 5-min time-step cooling electricity and the fraction of DR potential data. The stock data for the baseline study model of offices, schools, and data centres were used in this calculation. The calculation method is detailed in Section 3.5.2. 3.2 Data sources The National Construction Code (NCC) of Australia [82] was used as a reference to construct the baseline representative building - HVAC systems for schools, offices and data centres. School and office buildings are directly referenced in the NCC as Class 9b and Class 5 buildings, respectively. Data centres are not specifically classified. The NCC specifications vary according to different climate zones [93] as listed in Table 3. Simulations were carried out for zones 2, 5, 6, 7 and 8 using EnergyPlus hourly typical meteorological year (TMY) 2 2 A TMY file is a set of meteorological data with data values for every hour in a year for a given geographical location. weather data for their representative cities. Due to the lack of adequate building stock data, especially for data centres for climatic zone 1, and the small population, Northern Territory was excluded from DR studies. The monthly average hourly or daily electricity consumption meter data for schools, offices and data centres in Australia collected by the CSIRO research group for the NEAR Program [92] was used as the reference data for model calibration and validation. The building stock model data for schools, and offices, which were used to estimate state-wide aggregate cooling electricity demand and DR potentials were sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics [94], and Baseline Energy Consumption Report of Australia [77]. Due to the lack of information from the govt. site, the necessary building stock model data for data centres were collected from Cloudscene [83]. 3.3 Model validation Overall energy use predictions from the representative building models were compared with electricity meter data [92]. Meter data consisted of annual, monthly, daily, and hourly energy consumption data from 1327 school buildings, 288 office buildings, and 24 data centres. For each building type, upper and lower bound estimates for an average building were calculated from data for a given climatic zone over the periods (FY2016-20). Thus, this validation dataset represents an average consumption profile for each building type taken from across a range of buildings with potentially different physical characteristics, operational schedules, mechanical equipment, occupant behaviours and, to a lesser extent varying local climate conditions. Due to the lack of sub-metered data from the corresponding buildings, it was not possible to validate energy consumption from individual HVAC equipment (e.g., chillers, cooling towers, AHUs, pumps and fans). However, the end-use shares (breakdown of electricity usage) for each of the three building categories were calibrated against the data of energy consumption breakdown baseline studies of the corresponding buildings to ensure that they are in good agreement. Further, a detailed sensitivity analysis (detailed in Section 3.4) was performed including a wide variety of building design and HVAC-related parameters and applied variability limits for each of these parameters to reflect building and HVAC system variability within a building category. 3.4 Sensitivity analysis To better understand the range of building performance within a category, a detailed sensitivity analysis was performed with many of the design parameters varied, including location, cooling setpoint, occupancy density, lighting and equipment power density, window, roof, and wall construction materials, mechanical ventilation and infiltration rates, window-to-wall ratio, and building orientation. Therefore, sensitivity analysis identifies the relative influence of design variables on the DR potential and annual electricity. This was performed by sampling building operating and design parameters of the model around their nominal value to create a database of output data which was used to calculate the sensitivity of these outputs to parameter variation. Table 4 presents a description of these design parameters including their distribution details and variabilities. The relative importance of each design variable was quantified by the value of standardized regression coefficient (SRC). By constructing a linear relationship between design variables and model output, regression analysis provides a sensitivity measure of the model output, y to a design variable, x i and can be expressed as: (1) y = b 0 + ∑ i = 1 n b i x i The regression coefficients b i i = 1 , ⋯ , n are estimated by least squares method and the absolute standardized regression coefficient, SRC in the form of sensitivity measure is given by: (2) SRC i = b i s ^ i s where s ^ i and s indicate estimated standard deviations for x i and y , respectively. The statistical indices p and R2 values were calculated. The reliability of the SRC depends on the R2 value of the linear model. The linear regression p value for each design parameter was used to test the null hypothesis that the variable has no correlation with the model output. No correlation implies that there is no association between the changes in the design parameter and the shifts in the dependent variable. The Monte Carlo-based SA technique (i.e., random sampling method) [95] used here comprises the steps shown in Fig. 3 . The probability distributions of the dependent variables (i.e., output parameters), were used to identify the most influential factors impacting energy flexibility. The distributions of the characteristic variables (given in Table 4) were estimated using a combination of engineering judgement and the specifications in the NCC. Histograms and standard statistical measures (mean, medians etc.) were used to analyse the results. 3.5 Demand response events DR events were simulated during occupied hours by increasing the setpoint temperature by 2 °C from its nominal value and holding this offset for an hour. At the end of the hour the setpoint temperature was lowered back to the nominal value. As shown in Fig. 4 , each simulation represents a single DR event occurring at a particular hour of the occupied period. In this example, the occupied hour is 9 am to 5 pm and the cooling system is in operation from 7 am to 5 pm. The single-step DR events were repeated for each occupied hour of the day. The fraction of DR potential was calculated by comparing the average power consumption of the cooling system using a DR setpoint profile with the baseline power consumption within the DR event hour. The average baseline cooling electricity consumption rate of the individual representative building within the DR event period, t is defined as E t base and the cooling electricity consumption using the DR setpoint profile is defined as E t DR . Therefore, DR i captures the hourly load shed potential of the cooling system with respect to its base case scenario and can be expressed as 3 3 Relative demand response. , 4 4 Absolute demand response. : (3) DR potential in terms of percentage - RDR i ( % ) = E t base - E t DR E t base × 100 (4) DR potential in terms of magnitude - ADR i W / m 2 = E t base - E t DR 3.5.1 Piecewise regression fit for DR potentials To establish parametric relationships for the fraction (Eq.3) and magnitude (Eq. (4)) of DR as functions of time of day and ambient temperature, the DR potential data for the school, office and data centre was split into three temperature bands (TBs) (23 to 27 °C, 27 to 31 °C, 31 to 35 °C) and four time of the day bands (TDs) (9 am to 11 am, 11 am to 1 pm, 1 pm to 3 pm, 3 pm to 5 pm) covering building occupied periods only. Even though for the data centre, the occupied period is a whole day, and the cooling system functions 24/7, the parametric relationships between DR potential and outdoor temperature were determined for 9 am to 5 pm only. This is because different operational strategies of AHUs, such as economy air cycle and cool down cycle, are commonly in place at night-time and early morning to take advantage of the cooler ambient conditions. These temperature bands loosely correspond to mild, warm, and hot weather conditions, respectively. The data was then fit to a piecewise linear regression model (Fig. 5 ) of the form: (5) DR i = α + β 1 T + β 2 T - T 1 + β 3 ( T - T 2 ) Where the break-point temperatures T 1 ∼ 27 ° C , and T 2 ∼ 31 ° C were allowed to vary slightly from the nominal values during the fitting process. 3.5.2 State-wide cooling electricity demand and DR potentials The assessment of DR potentials under different weather conditions was carried out in six steps as shown in Fig. 6 . In the first step, the cooling capacity to meet the demand at peak conditions was estimated, assuming a design margin of 1.1. In the second step, building stock data sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics [96] and Australian govt. energy site [97] was combined with the estimated cooling capacity data for the individual representative buildings and used to estimate the maximum installed cooling capacity in each state. In the third step, the fraction of the installed cooling capacity used on weekdays under different climatic conditions was calculated for each temperature - hour of the day band. Only the summer months (Dec - Feb) were included. A total of 25,920 data points representing 5-min interval cooling electricity data and corresponding outdoor air temperature time-series data (Typical Meteorological Year data) 5 5 A TMY file is a set of meteorological data with data values for every hour in a year for a given geographical location. The data are selected from hourly data in a longer time period (typically ten years or more), with each month selected from the year that was considered most representative for that month. that spans between 1 Dec through 28 Feb were considered in this analysis. Next, these data were used to calculate the state-wide cooling electricity demand (Step 4). In step 5, the fraction of the DR potential available from implementing proposed GTA strategies, as detailed in Section 3.6, was calculated. Finally, the state-wide DR potentials from the cooling systems of individual building types were calculated using the state-wide cooling electricity data and the fraction of DR potential data of each representative building (Step 6). 4 Results 4.1 Model validation 4.1.1 School building Fig. 7 compares the monthly average daily electricity usage of the modelled representative school building in five locations within the NSW climatic zone with the electricity meter data for 1,327 schools in NSW (NEAR program data) [98]. The meter dataset represents the monthly average daily electricity usage of school buildings per student basis, grouped by geographical location, school level (primary, secondary) and student enrolment numbers. The maximum and minimum limits for meter data were generated from the four years of electricity usage data (FY2016-20) of different enrolment numbers in NSW schools. Depending on locations, the monthly average daily electricity usage varies by up to 47 to 53% over the year. The simulated model deviates from the data for October, November, and December possibly due to the reduction in student numbers that occurs as different year levels begin end of year exams and holidays at different times. The simulations assumed the same number of students throughout the year outside of official school holiday periods. Another possible explanation is reduced use of a/c systems over these periods. 4.1.2 Office building The monthly average daily electricity usage of the simulated office building in five locations in NSW, VIC, and QLD, is compared against the electricity meter data in Fig. 8 . The maximum and minimum limits for meter data were calculated by aggregating data from 4 and 5 star energy rated office buildings for a specific zone [98] over the periods (FY2016-20). In total, 288 buildings were included in this dataset. Thus, this validation dataset characterizes a combination of wide range of office buildings with different physical characteristics and operational schedules, mechanical equipment and their control mechanisms, diverse occupant behaviour and various ambient weather conditions. Depending on locations, the monthly average electricity usage in NSW, VIC, and QLD varies by approximately 20 to 29% over the year. In all three regions, the simulated results are in good agreement with the NEAR program data and follow similar trends. The monthly average electricity usage of electricity meter data in VIC from March to May shows a different trend than the simulated data, which could be due to the issue of simultaneous heating and cooling during shoulder months in mild temperate climates like VIC and not occurring in warm temperate or warm humid summer climates like NSW and QLD. 4.1.3 Data centre The monthly average daily electricity usage of the simulated data centres is compared against electricity meter data [98] in Fig. 9 . The metering data is from 24 data centres across Australia over the period July 2016 to June 2020. Given the small number of data centres in the dataset, the upper and lower limits were calculated by averaging the data from all data centres regardless of location. The simulated monthly average daily electricity usage is within the limits of the meter data and varies by up to 7% across the year, although the simulated results show less monthly variation. In the absence of detailed guidelines on the operational schedule of electrical equipment for the data centres the model was developed assuming near continuous operation of web hosting and server equipment throughout the year. These results suggest the equipment may not run at full load throughout the day. 4.2 Sensitivity analysis The relative influence of different input parameters on the total electricity consumption and ADR potential is summarised in Fig. 10 and Fig. 11 respectively. The SRC value ranks the input variables in order of sensitivity and the sign identifies whether the relationship is direct or inverse (Table 6). Total electricity is strongly influenced by lighting power density for the school and office buildings and by the high-density web hosting and server equipment for the data centre. Equipment power density also has a strong influence on the office building electricity consumption. Location is important for the school and office buildings since their electricity consumption has a large component due to heating and cooling. By contrast, data-centre electricity consumption is more influenced by the cooling setpoint since internal loads are much larger relative to external heat exchange with the ambient. The cooling setpoint and occupancy density are ranked, respectively, fourth and fifth in terms of their association with the electricity usage in an office building. The rest of the parameters, such as window-to-wall ratio, mechanical ventilation and infiltration rates, building construction and glazing parameters, orientation, have a moderate to low influence on electricity for all three building types. The cooling set-point temperature, flat roof and external wall construction materials, and window glazing type have an inverse relationship with the electricity usage, indicating that increasing cooling setpoint temperature or the insulation level leads to decrease in electricity consumption. For the ADR potential, location is the most important variable for the office and school buildings, whereas, for the data centre the equipment power density has more influence. For all three buildings, the cooling setpoint has a moderate to high influence, while occupancy density has a low to moderate effect. The window-to-wall ratio and lighting power density have a moderate impact on ADR in school and office buildings. The variables associated with windows, such as window-to-wall ratio and window glazing type, were not considered in the sensitivity analysis of the data centre. Infiltration and mechanical ventilation rates, flat roof construction, glazing type, external wall construction and building orientation have a low influence on ADR for all building cases. Also, equipment power density has little association with ADR from the office and school buildings. The R2 values of the individual models (Table 5 ), representing the models\u2019 data fitting capability, indicate that the variation in electricity demand was better explained by the input variables than the variation in ADR. R2 values ≥ 0.7 suggest that the SRC values of individual input parameters found from different sensitivity analyses are reliable. The energy flexibility opportunities from similar school or office buildings with almost identical HVAC system configurations varies quite significantly depending on location. Buildings with lower cooling setpoints offer more energy flexibility opportunities. Higher equipment power, lighting and occupancy densities leads to an increase in both annual electricity consumption and ADR potential. However, the relative importance of individual input variables to annual electricity or ADR is different for different building typologies. A building with a highly insulated roof, external wall construction materials, and triple-glazed windows offers less solar heat gains through the ceiling, wall and window compared to a poorly insulated office building and as a result has much lower of overall electricity demand. However, the ADR potential is only slightly less than a poorly insulated building. Fig. 12 shows box-whisker plots of the distribution of RDR potentials for the three buildings for each of the 12 input variables. RDR potential varied with location by 4.7%, 8.3% and 0.25% for the school, office and data centres, respectively. For the data centre, the cooling temperature setpoint has a large influence on the RDR potential with up to 5.2% variation between the upper and lower percentiles. In general, the RDR potential for the data centre is less variable due to the continuous operating schedule and the small influence of outside conditions. The power density distribution range considered in sensitivity analysis as per ASHRAE 90.4 (Energy Standard for Data Centres) [84] does not cause much difference in RDR (which is only 2.8%). 4.3 Piecewise regression fit for DR potentials For each building typology and time of the day band, the RDR potential was fit to Eq. (3). The R \u201csegmented\u201d function [99] was used to automatically detect the breakpoints of outdoor temperatures with respect to best guess estimate values of 27 °C and 31 °C. The resulting coefficients are given in Table D1 (Appendix D). Fig. 13 , Fig. 14 , and Fig. 15 show that the detected break points are in agreement with the slope changes observed in the simulated dataset of DR Potential. For the school building, RDR varied by a large amount with outdoor temperature from a peak of approximately 65% at an outdoor temperature of 25 °C to ∼ 40\u201345% at outdoor temperatures over 31 °C (Fig. 13). For 9 am to 11 am time of the day band, each degree increases in ambient temperature within the 23 °C to 25 °C temperature band leads to an increase in RDR by 1.5% (Table D1 (Appendix D)). Also, for other time of the day bands, an increase in outdoor temperature leads to a decrease in RDR and this decreasing rate varies for different temperature and time of the day bands. As per Eq. (3), if the magnitude of DR potential does not increase at the same rate as the baseline cooling electricity demand increases with outdoor temperature, the fraction of DR potential could show a downward trend. It indicates that internal heat gains rapidly change in the school building due to the effect of low thermal mass. For the office building, RDR varies from 15% to 35% when the outdoor temperature is between 23 °C and 35 °C, and the rate at which RDR varies with ambient temperature is different for different time of the day and temperature bands. The maximum variation (1.59% per °C) is observed between 23 °C and 25 °C for 9 am to 11 am temperature bands. For the data centre, the baseline cooling electricity demand does not vary much with the increase in ambient temperature (Appendix E Table E6). As a result, RDR potential varies only moderately with temperature. For hot weather conditions (31 °C to 35 °C), RDR decreases as the cooling equipment reaches the design cooling capacity. Note that even though the cooling system functions 24/7 in the data centre, the parametric relationships between RDR and outdoor temperature were not determined beyond 9 am to 5 pm since it is likely that different operational strategies of AHUs, such as economy air cycle and cool down cycle may be in place during these times to take advantage of the cooler ambient conditions. 4.4 State-wide cooling electricity demand and DR potentials Estimates of the state-wide installed cooling capacity required to meet the peak load conditions (MW electrical equivalent) in schools, offices, and data centres are given in Table 7 . Additional tables showing intermediate calculated quantities and results per hour of the day and temperature bands are given in Appendix E Table E1 to Table E3. The estimated installed a/c capacity in schools, office buildings and data centres are 1 GW, 2.3 GW and 0.2 GW respectively. For school buildings the fraction of the installed a/c capacity in use for a particular time window increases by up to 21% when the outdoor air temperature moves from the lower to upper band. For example, the fraction in use between 3 pm and 5 pm for the 23 to 27 °C temperature band is 28 to 36% depending on the state. However, for NSW when the outdoor temperature is in the 27 to 31 °C temperature band, the fraction increases to 52%. For office buildings the fraction of the installed a/c capacity in use increases by up to 15% when the outdoor air temperature moves from the lower to upper band. On average, the fraction varies by 11 ± 4% due to the variation in temperature band. For data centres, the fraction in use fluctuates by only 1 \u2013 3% for different outdoor temperature bands and time windows. Data centres near continuous operation and electrical server equipment running 24/7 are responsible for an almost constant amount of installed a/c capacity being used throughout the day. Office buildings have the largest share of cooling electricity demand among the three building typologies and the demand increases rapidly with temperature (Table E4, Table E5, and Table E6 in Appendix E). For example, in NSW demand increases from 450 MW to 584 MW when the outdoor temperature band changes from 27 to 31 °C to 31\u2013\u201335 °C. The state-wide cooling electricity demand from data centres is lower than for the other two building typologies since the floor area occupied by data centres is comparatively low (Table E3). The available relative DR potential from schools, offices, and data centres were calculated for each temperature and time of day band (Table E4, Table E5, and Table E6 in Appendix E). For all typologies, the fraction decreases as outdoor temperature increases since the magnitude of DR potential increases at a slower rate than the cooling electricity demand. This indicates some discrepancies in either building thermal mass, internal loads or insulation levels. And there may be a scope of using optimum thermal mass or insulation levels in these buildings to tackle a large diurnal temperature range present in tropical climates like Australia. For school buildings in the NSW climatic zone DR potential is 55% between 1 pm and 3 pm when the outdoor air temperature is in the 27\u201331 °C temperature band (Appendix E Table E4). This percentage varies by up to 3% depending on climatic zone, and by 10 ± 3% depending on outdoor air temperature band. For office buildings RDR is a maximum between 1 pm and 3 pm when the outdoor air temperature falls within the 23\u201327 °C temperature band. On average RDR varies by 5 ± 3% depending on the temperature band. For data centres RDR varies by up to 8% depending on the temperature band and by 8 ± 2% depending on the time of the day. However, for a specific temperature band and time window, it is almost independent of climatic zone since most of the heat load is due to the server electrical equipment. State-wide DR magnitudes are summarised in Table 8 and detailed in Appendix E Table E4 to Table E6. For school buildings in NSW the maximum of 90 MW occurs between 3 pm and 5 pm for outdoor temperature in the 27\u201335 °C band. For office buildings, the maximum of 134 MW occurs between 9 am and 11 am when the outdoor temperature is within the 31\u201335 °C band. The state-wide DR potential from the data centre is almost constant for all temperature and time of the day bands except from 9 am to 11 am when it\u2019s lower. 5 Discussion Estimates of potential state-wide HVAC DR resources reveal an untapped opportunity to unlock flexible demand in Australia's commercial building sector. The piecewise linear regression equations provided here allow this resource to be characterised as a function of key variables thus reducing the need for further detailed building modelling. The model reveals that energy flexibility opportunities via implementing a global setpoint temperature adjustment-based DR strategy largely vary depending on ambient weather conditions and time of the day and this variation is characteristic of the commercial building types. Therefore, working on DR scheduling for the individual building types may be beneficial to expand DR availability at the state level over a broader range of conditions, e.g., different times of the day, and ambient conditions. In general, school buildings were found to have the highest RDR potential (∼40\u201345%) for ambient temperatures over 30 °C, followed by data centres (∼20 \u2013 30%) and offices (∼20%). This variation is mostly due to a combination of differences in building thermal mass, internal loads and insulation levels. Buildings with higher thermal mass have longer thermal time constants associated with heating and cooling the structures and this leads to comparatively low DR potential. However, further studies are required to investigate the use of building thermal mass on offsetting cooling loads by incorporating, for example, different pre-cooling and ventilation strategies such as night-purge or considering supplementary thermal storage. The literature survey presented in Table 1 shows that DR potentials vary considerably between buildings. For example, the field test performed by Xu [100] demonstrated that 15 to 30% of peak electricity demand could be reduced in an office building on days when peak outside-air temperatures are over 100°F (∼38 °C) by implementing DR in conjunction with pre-cooling while Kiliccote [101] reported that commercial buildings could reduce peak demand from 5 to 15% with an average of 13%. Yin, et al. [13] confirmed that DR potential could be from 5 to 20% for outdoor temperatures between 24 and 35 °C. These results broadly align with the results presented here, though there are some contradictions with [13] in terms of correlation between DR potential and outside air temperature. These findings suggest that buildings designed based on the construction codes and practises of Australia differ in terms of their systems, thermo-hydraulic behaviour and control mechanisms, and therefore, findings from heating-dominated climates are not directly transferable to cooling-dominated countries even when normalised against temperature. The probabilistic distributions of DR potentials for the three buildings for each of the 12 input variables identify the most influential factors impacting energy flexibility. Results indicate that location has the strongest relative influence for school and office buildings, while for data centres, electrical equipment has the strongest influence. The cooling setpoint has a moderate to high influence on DR potential with up to 3%, 7.5%, and 5.2% variation between the upper and lower percentiles for the school, office and data centres, respectively. A commercial building with a highly insulated roof, external wall construction materials, and triple-glazed windows offers slightly less relative DR potential than a poorly insulated building. These findings agree with those in existing related studies [102\u2013104]. For estimating region or state-wide DR potentials the output of representative physics-based building simulation models must be scaled since it is not feasible to model all buildings directly. The advantage of the detail physics-based approach is that the influence of individual parameters can be studied in detail. However, to provide reliable aggregate estimates the models must be calibrated with real data to ensure assumptions are valid. Here individual building level electricity metering data for each of the three topologies was used for model calibration, however further validation of the aggregated estimates using data obtain via a top-down approach would also be useful. The estimated theoretical national maximum installed a/c cooling capacity across Australia for schools, offices and data centres is 1.0 GW, 2.2 GW, and 0.2 GW, respectively. NSW has the highest cooling electricity demand and DR potential for all building typologies. Depending on climatic zones, DR varies by up to 5%, 9%, and 1% for schools, offices, and data centres, respectively. However, this DR estimation was performed based on summer season Typical Meteorological Year data only. Further work could consider annual simulations as well as more extreme weather conditions. The combined DR potential across Australia for schools, offices and data centres is estimated to be between 551 and 647 MW. Comparison among three building typologies indicates that office buildings have the highest aggregate DR potential at between 1.5 and 1.7 times that of school buildings and between 9 and 11 times that of data centres. The unique services of individual buildings with considerably different operating profiles, designs and equipment lead to different energy flexibility behaviour in these buildings. These results may be useful for policymakers, building owners and electricity market actors, for example, for design of DR programs or network planning. As an extension of this study, more commercial building typologies can be incorporated into the assessment of DR potentials and develop DR related recommendations for different climatic zones considering different load characteristics of different building types. 6 Conclusions This study demonstrates that the energy flexibility behaviour is different for different commercial building types. DR potential varies significantly with ambient temperature and time of the day. Whilst for a school building, DR potential ranged from 30% to 75%, for an office building and data centre, this range is from 15% to 35%, and 13% to 40%, respectively. However, further study is needed to upscale these results at the energy grid level by incorporating time-of-use tariff and evaluating the economic benefits of energy flexibility. This study also reveals the multi-faceted influence of building operating and HVAC system parameters on the DR potentials of three building types. For example, DR potential from the school and office buildings is greatly influenced by the location and can vary by 4.7% and 8.3%, respectively. By contrast, for data centres the electrical equipment energy use has more relative influence on DR potential than other building operating and design variables. The cooling setpoint has an inverse relationship with the electricity usage and DR potential indicating that increasing cooling setpoint temperature leads to a decrease in electricity consumption or DR potential. This parameter has a moderate to high influence on DR potential with up to 3%, 7.5%, and 5.2% variation between the upper and lower percentiles for the school, office and data centres, respectively. A commercial building with a highly insulated roof, external wall construction materials, and triple-glazed windows offers slightly less relative DR potential than a poorly insulated building. This suggests that by changing occupancy/equipment power/lighting density or upgrading wall/roof/window insulation level, the fraction of DR potential can be improved by a certain percentage. The estimated state-wide cooling electricity demand and DR potential may be used to quantify the value of flexible demand in Australia's commercial building sector through implementing GTA-based DR strategies. The HVAC DR resources have been characterised as a function of ambient temperature and time of day. Therefore, the developed piecewise linear regression models reduce the need for further detailed building modelling and, thus, may reduce significant time and resources for computing a large scale of physical building models.

(1).

To calculate the state-wide electrical equivalent of air-conditioning cooling capacity for the office building, the stock data for the baseline study model of offices was retrieved from the Baseline Energy Consumption and Greenhouse Gas Emissions \u2013 In Commercial Buildings in Australia site [77] and used in calculation along with the simulated half-hourly cooling electricity data of the office building for individual climatic zones (Eq. (2)). Necessary building stock model data for data centres was collected from Cloudscene [83] and the same procedure was followed to calculate the state-wide electrical equivalent of air-conditioning cooling capacity for the data centre. 7 7 Note that installed air-conditioning capacity is different for different states. (2) State - w i d e Q off o r Q data centre = Q per floor area × A total where State - w i d e Q off o r Q data centre indicates state-wide cooling capacity (electrical equivalent) in offices or data centres, Q per floor area indicates installed air-conditioning capacity (electrical equivalent per floor area) in a typical office building/data centre for a specific climatic zone, and A total specifies total estimated floor area of the building stock for offices/data centres in that particular state. Step 2 In the next step, the fraction of the installed cooling capacity being used on weekdays for each 'bin' 8 8 Here, the \u2018bin\u2019 represents a particular temperature band and time window. under different weather conditions was determined from the simulated half-hourly cooling electricity data by splitting the data into three TBs, e.g., 23\u201327 °C, 27\u201331 °C, 31\u201335 °C and four TDs, e.g., 9 am \u2013 11 am, 11 am \u2013 1 pm, 1 pm − 3 pm, 3 pm \u2013 5 pm covering building occupied periods only (Eq.

Full summer season data was considered to conduct this analysis. A total of 25,920 data points representing 5-min interval cooling electricity data and corresponding outdoor air temperature time-series data that spans between 1 Dec through 28 Feb were considered in this analysis. Note that the analysis considers weekdays only and cooling electricity data for 23 °C ≤ OAT ≤ 35 °C.

The baseline cooling electricity consumption rate of the modelled school/office/data centre within the DR event period, t can be defined as E t base and the cooling electricity consumption using the DR setpoint profile is defined as E t DR . Therefore, DR i captures the hourly load shed potential of the cooling system with respect to its base case scenario. To establish parametric relationships for the fraction (Eq. (3)) and magnitude (Eq. (4)) of DR as functions of time of day and ambient temperature, the DR potential data for the school, office and data centre was split into three temperature bands (TBs) (23 to 27 °C, 27 to 31 °C, 31 to 35 °C) and four hour time of the day bands (TDs) (9 am to 11 am, 11 am to 1 pm, 1 pm to 3 pm, 3 pm to 5 pm) covering building occupied periods only and can be defined as 11 11 Relative demand response. , 12 12 Absolute demand response. : (5) D R p o t e n t i a l i n t e r m s o f p e r c e n t a g e - TD TB R D R i % = E t base - E t DR E t base × 100 (6) D R p o t e n t i a l i n t e r m s o f m a g n i t u d e - TD TB A D R i W / m 2 = E t base - E t DR The state-wide Electricity Demand Response from schools/offices/data centres was calculated for each 'bin' using Eq.

        "dc:description": "Demand response (DR) is widely recognized as an important mechanism in the Australian electricity market, though large-scale uptake in commercial buildings is yet to occur, in part due to the difficulty of characterising the resource. This paper describes a bottom-up physics-based approach to characterise the DR potential of three types of commercial buildings (schools, offices, and data centres) under a global set-point temperature offset strategy. Representative models are calibrated with energy meter data and parametric analysis is used to assess sensitivity to different building, operating and system parameters. Parametric equations are provided for relative DR potentials as functions of temperature and time of day. School buildings were found to have the highest relative DR potential (∼40\u201345%) for ambient temperatures over 30 °C, followed by data centres (∼20\u201330%) and offices (∼20%). Location has the strongest relative influence for school and office buildings and equipment energy intensity for data centres. The Australia-wide combined DR potential for school, office and data centres is estimated to be between 551 and 647 MW. Office buildings have the highest aggregate potential at between 1.5 and 1.7 times that of school buildings and between 9 and 11 times that of data centres.",
