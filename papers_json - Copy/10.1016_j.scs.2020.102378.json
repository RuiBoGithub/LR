With the popularization of smart power consumption technology, users can optimize the use of electrical equipment through a home energy management system (HEMS), thereby reducing electricity costs while maintaining a degree of comfort. In this study, we established an HEMS with distributed power and an electrical vehicle, describing a multi-objective optimization model with risk cost and risk index constraints, which have not been considered in previous work. The problem can be solved with improved genetic methods. First, this study establishes a mathematical model for the typical electrical equipment of specific smart home users. On this basis, with the user\u2019s electricity consumption cost and risk index being considered, we propose a multi-objective optimization model of the user\u2019s overall satisfaction and the corresponding constraints of the various devices in the home. This model is regarded as a two-stage optimization considering both electricity cost and power fluctuation. Finally, we verify the effectiveness of the model and the optimization algorithm through example simulations. Keywords Power system Home energy management system Risk index Modified genetic algorithm 1 Introduction Smart homes in the concept of renewable energy utilization have received significant attention from the public as fossil-fuel energy is running out. With the development of smart grids and smart home energy management systems (HEMS), the ability of users to actively participate in demand-side response (DSM) has improved (Iwafune et al., 2015; Ali et al., 2020). Users can optimize their electricity consumption and improve their comfort level with power consumption through HEMS. With the aim of sustainable economic development, it is crucial to limit the usage of fossil energy in HEMS. Clean energy or renewable energy, such as photovoltaic (PV) power and wind turbines, as well as flexible loads, such as electric vehicles (EVs), have received significant attention from researchers. PV generation forecasts have been combined with HEMS in a dynamic pricing system to reduce expenditures and improve end-user comfort (Iwafune et al., 2015). Solar-assisted thermal loads have been incorporated in models by Hieu T. Nguyen (Nguyen et al., 2015). A Qoe-approach has been introduced for HEMS with PV (Pilloni et al., 2016) and wind turbines have been considered renewable resources for participation in HEMS (Hemmati, 2017). In addition, time-scale parameters and uncertainties have been modeled in wind power systems (Mehrjerdi and Rakhshani, 2019a) and improved utilization of renewable sources has been enhanced by energy-sharing algorithms (Celik et al., 2018). The usage of V2H and V2G capabilities of EVs along with the two-way energy trading of energy storage system (ESS) have all been considered in a single HEMS (Erdinc et al., 2015). A stochastic dynamic programming framework has been proposed to deal with the optimization problem of stochastic EV management (Wu et al., 2018). In one study, an information gap decision theory was adopted (Moghaddas-Tafreshi et al., 2019) for a plug-in EV in an energy hub. Wind-solar batteries have been equipped in electric and hydrogen cars (Mehrjerdi et al., 2019) with both grid-connected and islanded modes. Reactive power compensation has been considered for the technology of V2G in EV to improve the power factor of home-to-grid connections (Golshannavaz, 2018). Battery integration also has been considered for the preservation of renewable energy (Lokeshgupta and Sivasubramani, 2019). Different forms of energy have been integrated to increase energy efficiency, such as combined heat and power, which has been considered in HEMS (Najafi-Ghalelou et al., 2019). Smart charging stations have been equipped with solar power to charge EVs (Mehrjerdi and Rakhshani, 2019b). V2H technology and renewable energy have been utilized in a building for energy management (Mehrjerdi and Hemmati, 2020). In the process of home energy management, forecasting and scheduling often are used. The forecasting process includes predicting unknown information through statistical historical information, including electrical consumption behavior, PV outputs, outdoor temperatures, and price fluctuations, and updating the probability density distribution function of these parameters. These parameters occasionally are treated as deterministic parameters in the process of energy management, even though there are some uncertainties, such as model uncertainty, measurement uncertainty, communication uncertainty, and prediction uncertainty (Wang et al., 2016). The method of dealing with prediction uncertainty is the most concerning. If the optimization proceeds in the case of deterministic parameters, the optimization results are far from advantageous, which results in the constraint violations of economic loss and user comfort. Therefore, it is essential to consider the uncertainty parameters as part of the optimization measures. Usually, t approaches can be taken for a prediction uncertainty problem: The first approach is the uncertainty optimization method, which includes stochastic programming, robust optimization, chance-constrained programming, stochastic dynamic programming, and fuzzy programming (Beaudin and Zareipour, 2015). The second approach is to adopt rolling optimization strategies, such as model predictive control and online planning. The first approach generally considers uncertainty in the model (objective functions and constraints). Stochastic optimization generates various finite-dimensional scenes using stochastic programming to describe the scenes of infinite-dimensional random variables that may occur, and it obtains optimal scheduling results through scene aggregation. The advantages and disadvantages of the scheduling scheme are compared through a multi-scene method that considers parameters such as the uncertainty of EVs or PV outputs (Shafie-Khah and Siano, 2018). A two-point prediction method is applied to the uncertainty distributed generation outputs, and the fixed weight of the method is used to aggregate each scene to obtain the optimization results (Rastegar et al., 2017). A Gaussian probability distribution function and a Monte Carlo simulation are used to tackle the uncertainties of wind and solar resources (Hemmati et al., 2017). These methods need to generate several scenes that fit the actual situation to obtain a probability distribution and conform to the uncertain variable. The calculation rate of the multi-scenario analysis method, in practice, is not high, and the result is doubtful. The more accurate the description of the uncertain variable, the larger the number of scenes, and the lower the efficiency of the model solution. Stochastic dynamic programming deals with coordination between load fluctuations and generator sets (Anonymous, 2020a). Information gap decision theory is used to calculate the positive and negative effects of electricity price fluctuations on reducing user spending (Najafi-Ghalelou et al., 2018). Wind power fuzzy interval prediction combined with robust optimization is adopted to enhance the robustness of microgrid to wind power fluctuations (Valencia et al., 2016). A user\u2019s power robustness coefficient, PV output robustness coefficient, variance, and conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) are used to describe the influence of the uncertain parameters of (Anonymous, 2020b; Wang et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2018) and (Wu et al., 2014), respectively. Although potential risk is considered according to the fluctuation of the electricity price and PV power, the noted methods adopt a Monte Carlo simulation for calculation, generating several scenes to evaluate. Consequently, it is computationally inefficient, which restricts its application. Electricity price and PV power are treated by adjustable robust optimization (Correa-Florez et al., 2018), yet they are considered separately. The second type of approach mitigates the effects of uncertain variables through immediate control. Rolling optimization is adopted to resist the fluctuations of random variables (Silvente et al., 2018). A sliding time window model is adopted to solve the cogeneration model (Zheng et al., 2018), and a Monte Carlo simulation method is used to generate the probability density of the scenario calculation results. The power fluctuation difference caused by random variables is reduced by achieving prediction, day-ahead scheduling, and day-in scheduling (Anonymous, 2020c). Although this method can mitigate the impact of uncertain variables, it fails to account for the risk loss of a user\u2019s economy or comfort when the optimization results are still affected by uncertainties. In summary, most of the previous research studies have limitations with respect to the treatment of HEMS random variables. The random variables included in the models of electrical equipment and objectives are treated separately and need classification and comprehensive analysis. Additionally, few articles have focused on the risk cost caused by price prediction, PV prediction, and load prediction as a whole. It is also not computationally effective to adopt these methods, in particular, when the CVaR is calculated, and the probability density distribution function of random variables is known. Generally, home energy management is modeled as a linear programming problem with objective functions and constraints. For the optimization strategy of HEMS, many related studies have been conducted and can be divided into two categories. The first category includes the use of solution toolbox or commercial software (e.g., CPLEX) to solve problems, and the second category includes the use of intelligent algorithms, such as mathematical optimization algorithms or heuristic algorithms, to solve problems. These two methods have distinct advantages and disadvantages. The first method is widely used because of its fast solving speed. The mixed integer linear programming solver resolves the problem in CPLEX (Kong et al., 2019; Mohsenian-Rad and Leon-Garcia, 2010; Tasdighi et al., 2014). Huang and Liu applied a linear interactive general optimizer (Zhang et al., 2018). These solver tools can get results at the second or even the millisecond level. These solvers, however, handle the constraints in a simple way (especially for integer programming problems). In this case, only a sole solution can ultimately be obtained, and the performance of the solution cannot be comprehensively evaluated (Zhang et al., 2018). Additionally, a commercial software program cannot be embedded suitably in HEMS, and this type of software is expensive (Huang et al., 2016). For the second kind of method, the system cost can be economized by applying the algorithm to the embedded system of a smart home. The second kind of traditional mathematical optimization algorithms includes analytical methods like the linear relaxation method and the Benders decomposition method (Huang et al., 2018). Although the calculation is accurate in theory, the calculation speed will decrease sharply with an increase in variables. Therefore, greedy heuristic methods, which can solve the problem, are widely used to solve the second kind of method, but the results may fall into a local optimum solution. A lot of research has been conducted on this problem to obtain a global optimal solution. The opportunity optimization model was established in (Huang et al., 2018), using the improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to solve the problem. The advantage of the algorithm was determined by comparing it with the results of competitive PSO and CPLEX. An improved genetic algorithm (GA) with a detection mechanism was used in (Yang et al., 2018). The mutation operator was improved, and the result was compared with PSO and binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO). A new heuristic natural aggregation algorithm (NAA) was used in (Luo et al., 2018). Genetic binary particle swarm optimization (GBPSO) was applied by Nadeem and Mudassar et al. in HEMS to verify the effectiveness of this algorithm (Javaid et al., 2017). The adaptive adjustment of the penalty function was not considered in these algorithms for several constraints, however, and further improvements of the algorithm are needed to obtain accurate results. In addition, considering the overall safety of a power grid, the utility hopes that users of power purchases can smoothly purchase power fluctuations to prevent new power purchase peaks resulting from users concentrating on electricity purchases during times when electricity prices are lower, thus reducing the risk of insufficient power supply to the power grid (Hemmati et al., 2017), (Correa-Florez et al., 2018). The power over-limit problem is crucial when random variables are not predicted accurately. Considering the probabilities of multiple solutions to one objective, it is possible to select the best results that cause the fewest power fluctuations. It is necessary to introduce a second-stage optimization and to solve it in combination with an optimization algorithm. As an important part of residents' two-way interaction technology, a large number of practices have been carried out in the research of smart homes. In 1984, the world's first intelligent building was completed in the United States, but the building only used computer technology to collect information on air conditioning, lighting and other equipment, and did not implement intelligent control of home systems. In 2000, nearly 30 communities in Singapore adopted this intelligent system, with up to 40,000 households in the United States. This system brings a lot of profits to businesses, and the construction of networked homes has brought more than 450 billion US dollars in market value. In China, in terms of technical research, relying on the National 863 smart grid project and the science and technology project of State Grid Corporation of China, smart community, two-way interaction, electric vehicle charging and discharging, distributed power access coordination control and other technologies are carried out to realize the monitoring, analysis and control of household load. From 14:00 to 14:30 on July 26, 2016, Jiangsu province implemented the first province power demand response, with 3154 participating users and a real load reduction of 3.52 million kilowatts. At present, the total demand response scale of Jiangsu Province has exceeded that of North America, and the single demand response volume of this demand response ranks first in the world. Nowadays, the smart home technology is becoming more and more mature, and companies led by Microsoft and Motorola in the United States have successively entered the research and development of smart home systems, yet these systems have their own shortcomings. The randomness of known parameters should be fully considered, and the user should be given the right to judge the risk. On the basis of this analysis, this paper proposes a home energy management heuristic algorithm based on risk indexes. The algorithm can be applied to a two-stage optimization. The model adopts an improved genetic algorithm combined with adaptive penalty functions and improves the algorithm in the selection, crossover, and mutation parts, to avoid falling into local optimum and a faster convergence rate. The innovative work of this paper includes the following three aspects. 1 The proposed algorithm extends the single-stage optimization in energy management to two-stage optimization. The first-stage optimization reduces the cost of purchasing electricity for users. The second-stage optimization is carried out on the results of the optimization of the first stage, without increasing the cost of purchasing electricity for users. Electric power fluctuation is treated as the objective function to eliminate the multisolution problem caused by power transfer during optimization, thus smoothing power fluctuations at the same time and effectively avoiding the risk of a household purchase being over-limit. 2 The model adopts an improved genetic algorithm that improves the selection, intersection, and mutation of the algorithm. The penalty function is changed from a fixed value to an adaptive value. When the number of decision variables is large, the model reduces the risk that the optimization result falls into a local optimal solution. 3 Compared with the quoted references, the proposed method fully considers the influence of uncertainty fluctuation on the optimization results in the process of random variables that are supposed to be predicted by HEMS considering the classification of random variables. The influence of uncertainty is also extracted from the corresponding indicators as the risk index (RI), which is used for the user\u2019s electricity comfort constraints and the potential economic cost of the user\u2019s electricity. The method avoids the multiscenario aggregation, minimizing calculations as much as possible, and the user has the independent decision-making right to cope with the fluctuation of the uncertainty variables, thereby achieving the efficient control of family energy use. Through the research, the method we propose can improve the capacity to absorb distributed renewable energy. In this way, sustainable development of green energy will be achieved. Intelligent energy use is an important part of the modernization of the city and society. This paper increases the interaction between users and the utility company through the method of potential risk. The intelligent use of energy has been realized.Through the optimization method, the energy consumption of residents is reduced and the energy efficiency is improved. The structure of the paper is as follows. The first part describes the specific structure of the HEMS. The second part elaborates on the typical household load model and the risk indexes associated with loads. The third part describes the household energy optimization goal considering the risk indexes. The solution strategy based on the improved genetic algorithm is introduced in the fourth part, and the last part provides an example of the proposed method. 2 Home energy management system architecture A typical home energy management system architecture is shown in Fig. 1 . Energy sources such as electricity, gas, and heat are provided by municipal and household distributed energy supply systems. The price of gas and heat is fixed, and the price of electricity is determined by the utility, which is in the pricing model. The home energy management system can realize intelligent control of electric vehicle battery, temperature-controlled load, non-interruptible load and other loads (Kong et al., 2016). At the same time, users can set risk indexes according to their own risk preferences through human-computer interaction equipment and obtain real-time control status of household electrical equipment. The home energy management control center is a decision-making system that controls the adjustable load and predicts the fluctuation of the current electricity price through the electricity price information released by the utility company in the early stage, meanwhile it gets consumption information from the smart meter and predicts users\u2019 behavior (Kong et al., 2019). The photovoltaic power source is converted into AC power by inverter for other power supply settings. The electric vehicle battery can be charged or discharged through a bidirectional inverter. The system we build is for daily operation, and at the start of each day, the status of each electrical appliance is scheduled in the day before. Users can judge the risk of comfort and power consumption cost, decide the risk index which is described in the next section. 3 Typical household load model and its risk index The load on the consumer side of home energy management is divided into adjustable and unadjustable types. An unadjustable load refers to the type of load for which the change of power consumption time or power will have a great impact on user comfort, such as televisions and desktop computers. Adjustable loads can be divided into interruptible loads and uninterruptible loads. An interruptible load is usually a device that can control the power of a load during operation, such as an air conditioner and water heater. An uninterruptible load is usually a fixed-duty cycle device that cannot stop and start at will during the duty cycle of the load, such as a dishwasher or a rice cooker. The traditional adjustable load model does not consider the risk problem. Based on (Anonymous, 2020b), we improved the user robustness coefficient and obtained a simpler and more complete mathematical expression. 3.1 Uninterruptible load For uninterruptible loads, such as dishwashers, rice cookers, and washing machines, the starting time can be changed within the allowable operating time range. The temporal constraints are shown in (Pilloni et al., 2016). The working time of an uninterruptible load was previously allocated by the energy management system. Because of the uncertainty of the user\u2019s power consumption behavior, the power consumption time the load user expected deviated from the previous optimization result, resulting in a decrease in the user\u2019s power consumption comfort. It was defined in (Anonymous, 2020b) that the robustness index was based on the redundancy of tasks that could be completed ahead of time, without considering the circumstance of the task starting early. Based on this, we propose the following time risk coefficient. We assume that the user tended to use the electrical appliances in the middle of the defined running time interval and that the user predicted the deviation between the load running time and the expected running time. The time risk index RI load i is defined as follows: (1) R I load i , start = t load i − N i − t load,start i t load,end i + t load,start i 2 − N i − t load,start i (2) R I load i , end = t load,end i − N i − t load i t load,end i − N i − t load,start i + t load,end i 2 , where Ni is the working time of each device, t load,start i indicates the allowed start time of each working interval, t load,end i indicates the allowed end time of each working interval, t load i indicates the starting time of the optimization, the divisor is used as normalization, and the subscript i corresponds to every uninterruptible load. The stricter the user demand for the kind of electric appliance, the more likely the electric appliance will operate away from the border, and the stronger the ability to resist the change of the user\u2019s electricity behavior. Appliances with multiple working intervals in a day can be broken into uninterruptible loads of multiple individual working intervals, the number of which is equal to the number of working sections. 3.2 Interruptible load The interruptible load type includes the temperature control type and energy storage type. We select non-cool storage air conditioners and electric water heaters as typical temperature control loads and electric vehicles as energy storage type loads. 3.2.1 Air conditioner A typical thermodynamic model for air conditioning loads is shown in (Wang et al., 2018). Because the outdoor temperature in the thermodynamic model can be obtained by a daily prediction, it is a random variable, and its volatility can cause temperature fluctuations in the indoors of the scheduling result. Therefore, in the daily scheduling, considering the user\u2019s requirements for temperature comfort, the temperature coefficient of the air conditioning is introduced based on the temperature robustness coefficient proposed in (Anonymous, 2020b) to describe the tolerance of users to temperature fluctuations. The risk index based on the normalization method is described in the cooling state as follows: (2) R I air = ∑ t = 1 t end T air, max − T in ( t ) ( T air, max − T air , min ) ⋅ t end , where t end represents the end time of operation, T in ( t ) indicates the indoor temperature of the t th period, and T air , max and T air,min indicate the upper and lower limits of the indoor temperature, respectively. The expression indicates that the more distance the room temperature after optimization had from the maximum temperature distance, the easier it was to resist the influence of the outdoor temperature rise on the optimization result. 3.2.2 Water heater For water heaters, the thermodynamic model proposed in (Tasdighi et al., 2014) was used. Upon predicting the water consumption of the user in the water heater model, we find that it had randomness. Thus, we have to consider that the water consumption of the water heater during the continuous water usage might be greater and that the weight coefficient of the risk index would be larger. The weight distribution of the unused hot water is smaller, however. Therefore, based on the temperature robustness coefficient proposed in (Anonymous, 2020b), this improvement is described as follows: (3) R I heat = ∑ t = 1 t end w t ⋅ ( T eh ( t ) - T eh,min ) ( T eh,max − T eh,min ) ⋅ t end (4) ∑ t = 1 t end w t = t end , where w t is the weight of the distribution for the hot water usage, T eh ( t ) is the temperature of the hot water heater during the t th period, and T eh , max and T eh , min are the hot water upper and lower limits of the electric water heater. This formula indicates that the greater the heat storage of the water heater, the easier it was to resist the influence of additional water consumption on the hot water temperature. 3.2.3 EV The electric vehicle battery was equivalent to the model proposed in (Wu et al., 2018). The arrival time, departure time, and initial electric quantity of the electric vehicle model were predicted to be random variables. Therefore, we have to consider the impact of these uncertainties on the power purchase plan. 1) Power risk index Referring to the previous temperature risk coefficients, the power risk index is expressed as follows: (5) R I EV,power = S O C ( t EV,end ) − S O C must S O C max − S O C min , where SOC(t) is the energy storage of the storage battery in the t period, and t EV,end indicates the end time of the allowable charging of the electric vehicle; S O C max and S O C min are the upper and lower limits of the battery energy storage for electric vehicles, respectively; and S O C must indicates the amount of charge to be charged. This formula shows that the more electricity available at the end of charging exceeding the amount required for travel, the easier it will be to withstand the effects of random variable fluctuations. 2) Time risk index Referring to the previously noted time risk coefficients, the time risk index is expressed as follows: (6) R I EV, start = t EV, start real − t EV,start t EV , start + t EV , end 2 − t EV , start (7) R I EV,end = t EV,end − t EV, end real t EV , end − t EV , start + t EV , end 2 , where t EV , start and t EV,end are the allowed starting time of the plugged-in time of the EV and the allowed end time of the unplugged time of the EV, respectively; t EV, start real and t EV, end real are the real boundaries for the plugged-in time and unplugged time of the EV, respectively. This formula shows that the more restrictions the EV owner required for the constraints of the plugged-in and unplugged times, the better ability the optimization will have to resist the time uncertainty of EV travel. 4 Objectives and constraints of home energy optimization management considering the risk index Traditional home energy management usually considers electricity purchase costs from the perspective of users, but not from the security of a grid from the perspective of the utility. Therefore, we need to consider introducing two-stage optimization to solve the previously described problems. For the nonoptimal problem of a power purchase plan caused by stochastic variables in the first-stage optimization objective function, we simplify the calculation by introducing CVaR as a cost function. 4.1 Objective function in the first stage The system function of household energy management needs to comprehensively consider economy and user comfort. The objective function of this study minimizes the impact of power consumption cost and comfort. The two objective functions are combined as the objective functions of this study. For the economic objective function, we first analyze the case without the risk index, including a user\u2019s electricity consumption fee and energy storage depreciation fee. The total user\u2019s electricity consumption fee is expressed as follows: (8) min C 1 = ∑ t = 1 t end ρ grid ( t ) ⋅ P grid ( t ) , where P grid ( t ) is the electricity purchased from the grid in the analysis period, and ρ grid ( t ) is the price between the users and the utility. When ρ grid ( t ) > 0, it is expressed as purchasing electricity; when ρ grid ( t ) < 0, it is expressed as selling electricity; in our simulation, the selling price is defined as half of the purchasing price at that time according to Tianjin Intelligent Demand Side Management Platform. For the case in which the risk index is included, the random variable needs to be extracted from the objective function for analysis. For the grid exchange power, this is obtained with the following formula: (9) P grid ( t ) = P must ( t ) + P air ( t ) + P heat ( t ) + P load ( t ) + P bat ( t ) − P pv ( t ) , where P grid ( t ) , P pv ( t ) , and P bat ( t ) are the power purchased from the grid during the t th period, the power of the distributed power generation, and the charge (discharge) power of the stored energy. P must ( t ) , P heat ( t ) , P air ( t ) , and P load ( t ) are the power of the unadjustable load, water heater, air conditioner, and uninterruptible load for the t th period, respectively. For the emergency control of the power grid, a scheduling management risk is inherent in the switching power of the objective function and the grid. At the same time, the output of the distributed power source is also uncertain, which affects the optimization results of the home energy management. To better describe the risk factor resulting from fluctuations in the external variables, this study uses CVaR (Woll, 2015) to describe the condition in which the loss of the portfolio exceeds a given value of the VaR. Next, the average loss value of the portfolio can be determined. If the stochastic loss of the set portfolio is -X(-X<0) and VaRβ is the VaR with a confidence level of 1-β, then the CVaR mathematical formula can be expressed as (10) CVaR β = E − X | − X ≥ VaR β . To calculate the CVaR values associated with the cost of purchasing electricity due to three random variables, we first have to model the volatility of these three random variables. In general, the probability density function proposed in (Moghaddas-Tafreshi et al., 2019) describes the randomness of the three variables; P must ( t ) and ρ grid ( t ) are described by a truncated normal distribution, that is\u2014 P must ( t ) ∼ N ( μ 1 ( t ) , σ 1 2 ( t ) ) ρ grid ( t ) ∼ N ( μ 2 ( t ) , σ 2 2 ( t ) ) where μ 1 ( t ) and σ 1 ( t ) are the mean and variance of the unadjustable load power; μ 2 ( t ) and σ 2 ( t ) are the mean and variance of the electricity price. According to normal distribution function 3 σ principle, the probability of the numerical distribution in (μ-3σ, μ+3σ) is 0.997, and the probability of exceeding this range is less than 0.3%. The upper and lower limits of P must ( t ) and ρ grid ( t ) were [ μ 1 ( t ) − 3 σ 1 ( t ) , μ 1 ( t ) + 3 σ 1 ( t ) ], [ μ 2 ( t ) − 3 σ 2 ( t ) , μ 2 ( t ) + 3 σ 2 ( t ) ]. P pv ( t ) is described by the beta distribution: P pv ( t ) ∼ P pv,max ( t ) ⋅ β ( a ( t ) , b ( t ) ) , where P PV, max ( t ) is expressed as the maximum PV output per time period, and a ( t ) and b ( t ) corresponded to the corresponding beta distribution parameters. The mean value of P pv ( t ) is μ 3 ( t ) , which can be described as (8) μ 3 ( t ) = P PV, max ( t ) ⋅ a ( t ) a ( t ) + b ( t ) . The power output range of the photovoltaic power is [0, P PV, max ( t ) ]. Therefore, under the influence of these kinds of random variables, the probability distribution of the objective function is not a regular distribution, and the CVaR value is difficult to solve using a normal calculation. To minimize the amount of calculation, the risk degree λ price of the user is calculated in this study to avoid the computational efficiency caused by multiscenario analysis. The position of the random variable in the first part of Equation (5) is different, and the effect on the decision variable also is different. P must ( t ) and ρ grid ( t ) are added to the decision variables, affecting the total amount of power consumption of the user during each period; ρ grid ( t ) is multiplied by the decision variables, affecting the distribution of purchased power in each period. Therefore, this is discussed separately. First, for Equation (7), when the degree of risk λ prcie ∈ ( − 1 , 1 ) is included in the equation, it is defined as (9) P grid ( t ) = ( μ 1 ( t ) − λ price ⋅ 3 σ 1 ( t ) ) + P air ( t ) + P heat ( t ) + P load ( t ) + P bat ( t ) − ( μ 3 ( t ) + λ price ⋅ P PV, max ( t ) ⋅ b ( t ) a ( t ) + b ( t ) ) λ price ≥ 0 ( μ 1 ( t ) − λ price ⋅ 3 σ 1 ( t ) ) + P air ( t ) + P heat ( t ) + P load ( t ) + P bat ( t ) − ( μ 3 ( t ) + λ price ⋅ P PV, max ( t ) ⋅ a ( t ) a ( t ) + b ( t ) ) λ price < 0 . When a user is more inclined to accept the risk, the closer λ price is to 1, the more the user is inclined to believe that the PV power generation value will be greater than the average value and the unadjustable load value will be less than the average value. In contrast, when a user is more inclined to avoid risk, the closer λ price is to −1, the more users are inclined to believe that the next day\u2019s PV power generation value will be less than the mean value and that the unadjustable load value will be greater than the mean value. When the value of P grid(t) is determined, the CVaR can be calculated based on this value. At this point, the random variable of the equation includes only the randomness of the electricity price and is in accordance with the normal distribution. Therefore, (10) C 1 = ∑ t = 1 t end ρ grid ( t ) ⋅ P grid ( t ) = E ( ∑ t = 1 t end ρ grid ( t ) ⋅ P grid ( t ) ) + ∑ t = 1 t end Δ ρ grid ( t ) ⋅ P grid ( t ) , where the deviation, Δ ρ grid ( t ) ∼ N ( 0 , σ 2 2 ( t ) ) , so (11) C 1 = ∑ t = 1 t end ρ grid ( t ) ⋅ P grid ( t ) ∼ N ( ∑ t = 1 t end P grid ( t ) ⋅ μ 2 ( t ) , ∑ t = 1 t end ( P grid ( t ) ⋅ σ 2 ( t ) ) 2 ) . The relative CVaR can be expressed as (Woll, 2015) (12) C CVaR = c ( β ) σ , where c ( β ) = φ [ Φ − 1 ( β ) ] / ( 1 − β ) , σ follows the standard deviation of the normal distribution, which is the confidence level; φ ( ⋅ ) is a probability density function of the standard normal distribution N (1, 0); and Φ − 1 ( β ) is the β upper quantile of N (1, 0). When the confidence is selected, it is a fixed value. Thus, an economic objective function considering the risk index can be obtained, which is expressed as follows: (13) min C 1 = E ( B ) + w price ⋅ C CVaR ( B ) (14) E ( B ) = ∑ t = 1 t end P grid ( t ) ⋅ μ 2 ( t ) (15) C CVAR ( B ) = C ( β ) ⋅ ∑ t = 1 t end P grid ( t ) ⋅ σ 2 ( t ) 2 , where w price is the weight coefficient in the negative correlation with λ price. When λ price is larger, the users accept risks more easily and are less sensitive to risks. The smaller w is when λ price is smaller, the more easily users avoid risks and the more sensitive they are to risks, the greater w price is. 4.2 Second-stage optimization objective function The optimization objective function of the first stage minimizes the net expenditure cost of the user. However, simply minimizing the economic cost of the user\u2019s net expenditure leads to a problem. The electric power will be transferred to other time periods when the other electricity prices are equal or when the sum of the electricity prices is equal, which causes multiple solutions and a new high-power purchasing peak. This power-purchasing peak causes high peak-to-average ratio (PAR) power consumption, leading to a potential power supply shortage. To solve this potential risk, a second-stage optimization objective function needs to be introduced. The objective function is expressed as (17) min C 3 = ∑ t = 1 t end w grid ( t ) ⋅ | P grid ( t ) − P grid ( t ) ¯ | (18) ∑ t = 1 t end w grid ( t ) = 1 , where P grid ( t ) ¯ is expressed as the average value of the purchasing power. Therefore, the power consumption differences of each time period will be reduced. w grid ( t ) is defined as the weight of the differences of each time period in an inverse relationship with the electricity prices. The higher the electricity prices, the more reluctant consumers are to purchase electricity prices, and the lower the risk of the peak. The whole formula can be expressed as the fluctuation of the overall purchasing power of users. The purpose of this formula is to reduce the risk of exceeding the limit of a certain period caused by the concentrated purchasing of electricity at the same low-price period and to achieve a smooth process of purchasing power. Optimization needs to be considered in conjunction with the first stage. Hence, in addition to the constraints mentioned above, we add the following: (19) C cost ≤ C cost , min . In addition, the optimization decision variables include battery power and start-up time of the adjustable load. Therefore, other variables should continue to operate according to the results of the first-stage optimization. 4.3 Constraints The HEMS in this study considers the following constraints: 4.3.1 Power constraints in power grids (20) | P grid ( t ) | ≤ P grid,max ( t ) , where P grid,max ( t ) represents the power exchange limitation between the user and the power grid at each time period. 4.3.2 Uninterruptible load constraints (21) t load,start ≤ t load ≤ t load,end − N , t ∈ N * , where N is the working duration of the device, t load,start indicates the allowed start time for each work interval, t load,end indicates the allowable end time for each work interval, t load indicates the start time for optimization, and N* refers to a positive integer. 4.3.3 Air conditioner constraints (22) 0 ≤ P air ( t ) ≤ P air,max (23) T air,min ≤ T in ( t ) ≤ T air , max , where P air ( t ) is the power of the t th period during the cooling of the air conditioner, P air,max is the rated power of the air conditioner refrigeration, Δ t is a period of time, and T air , max and T air , min are the upper and lower limits of the indoor temperature. 4.3.4 Water heater constraints (24) ≤ P eh ( t ) ≤ P eh , max (25) T eh , min ≤ T eh ( t ) ≤ T eh , max , where T eh ( t ) is the temperature of the hot water of the water heater in the t th period, P eh,max is the rated power of the water heater, and T eh , max and T eh , min are the upper and lower limits of the hot water of the electric water heater, respectively. 4.3.5 EV battery constraints (26) S O C min ≤ S O C ( t ) ≤ S O C max ( 0 ≤ t EV ≤ t EV,end o r t EV,start ≤ t EV ≤ t end ) (27) P dh , max ≤ P bat ( t ) ≤ P ch , max ( 0 ≤ t EV ≤ t EV,end o r t EV,start ≤ t EV ≤ t end ) (28) S O C ( t ) = 0 ( t EV,end ≤ t EV ≤ t EV,start ) (29) P bat ( t ) = 0 ( t EV,end ≤ t EV ≤ t EV,start ) (30) S O C ( t EV,end ) ≥ S O C must (31) S O C ( 1 ) = S O C ( t end ) , where SOC(t) is the energy storage of the battery t th period, P bat ( t ) is the charging and discharging power of the battery during the t th period, and S O C max and S O C min are the upper and lower limits of the energy storage of the EV battery, respectively; P ch , max and P dh , max are the upper and lower limits of the charge and discharge power of the electric vehicle batteries; t EV , t EV,start , and t EV,end are the time period, initial time, and end time that the electric car could charge, respectively; and S O C must is the amount of charge that needed to be completed. The last equation represents the intertemporal constraints of the EV batteries. 4.3.6 Risk index constraints (32) R I i ≥ R I set , i ( i = 1 , 2 , 3......6 ) . The formula indicates that the risk index of each piece of electrical equipment must satisfy the predefined requirements of the consumer. 5 Model solving based on an improved genetic algorithm The mathematical model built in this study uses mixed integer programming. Genetic algorithms can solve problems for which the objective function and constraints are nonlinear or linear. Because this type of algorithm can easily fall into the local optimal solution, the algorithm needs to be improved accordingly. This study proposes improvements in the selection, crossover, and mutation of the genetic algorithms embedded with adaptive penalty functions to solve this problem. 5.1 Improved genetic manipulation There are three basic operations in genetic algorithms: selection, crossover, and mutation. The selection operation is improved by combining the sorting selection and the optimal worst selection, the crossover and mutation operators are adaptively adjusted, and the penalty function is adaptively adjusted. 5.1.1 Selection Roulette selection is a classical operator of a traditional genetic algorithm. The operator is selected according to probability in the selection process. Although individuals with larger fitness values have a larger probability of being selected in the process of subsequent crossover and mutation and becoming the next generation of individuals, individuals with larger fitness values also have a certain probability of being ignored. Moreover, the closer the algorithm is to convergence, the smaller the fitness difference between individuals, and the greater the probability of this situation. This study improves upon the sorting method proposed by Gaohang et al. (Yan et al., 2019). In each step of the selection, one-quarter of the individuals with less net expenditure (or power fluctuation) will be saved, and one-quarter of the individuals with higher net expenditure (or power fluctuation) will be replaced. The selection of individual roulette in the middle provides the basis for the next adaptive crossover and variation. 5.1.2 Crossover and mutation Srinivas proposed a classical genetic algorithm for adaptively adjusting the mutation rate and the crossover rate in (M.Srinivas, 2020). The adaptive adjustment of Pc and Pm values can be used when individual fitness is higher than average fitness, but when the individual fitness is lower than the average fitness based on the larger fixed Pc and Pm values, it causes the quality individuals carried by some inferior individuals to be destroyed. On the basis of previous considerations, this study uses the adaptive crossover and mutation probability proposed by (Yan et al. (2019)), as shown in the formula below: (33) P c = K 1 ( 1 − arcsin ( f ave f max ) π / 2 ) K 1 arcsin ( f ave f max ) π / 2 arcsin ( f ave f max ) ≥ π / 6 arcsin ( f ave f max ) < π / 6 (34) P m = K 2 ( 1 − arcsin ( f ave f max ) π / 2 ) K 2 arcsin ( f ave f max ) π / 2 arcsin ( f ave f max ) < π / 6 arcsin ( f ave f max ) ≥ π / 6 . Using the arcsin function can better distinguish the concentration and dispersion degree of the population fitness with the f ave transformation. The judgment is π / 6 , because sin ( π / 6 ) = 1/2, so when arcsin ( f ave / f max ) ≥ π / 6 , f ave / f max ≥ 1 / 2 . The fitness is concentrated, which indicates that the population fitness is close to the maximum fitness concentration distribution. Then, whether or not to cross or mutate first can be determined according to π / 12 ≤ arcsin ( f ave / f max ) < π / 3 . When the population is at the primary stage of evolution and the end of evolution, the population fitness might be very scattered or very concentrated. At this time, the original operation is mutated, and then a cross-operation can speed up the convergence. Therefore, according to the noted measures, the resulting individual population net expenditure (or power fluctuation) fitness value dispersion of the population is moderate. Thus, the obtained results converge to a uniform value and accelerate the convergence speed. 5.1.3 Adaptive penalty function For the inequality constraint, the decision variable can be processed by the constraint function. For other inequality constraints, the penalty function method usually is used\u2014that is, the constraint condition is introduced into the original objective function to form a new function, as follows. The out-of-bounds inequality constraint is appended to the original objective function in the form of a penalty term, thereby forming a new objective function (i.e., a penalty function) as follows: (35) F ( u , x ) = f ( u , x ) + ∑ i = 1 s w i . The inequality constraint is expressed as h ( u , x ) ≤ 0 . The penalty term for the inequality constraint is (36) w i = γ i h i ( u , x ) , i f h i ( u , x ) > 0 0 , i f h i ( u , x ) ≤ 0 . The value of the penalty term is related to the size of the penalty factor, and a large value needs to be taken in the later stage of the algorithm so that the corresponding out-of-bound constraint can be re-satisfied. To avoid the convergence deterioration, it is not reasonable to obtain large values from the beginning, but rather to adaptively adjust according to the proportion of qualified individuals in the population. The corresponding adjustment measures were improved in (Cai and Guo, 2015). The program flow chart for HEM optimization method considering potential risk cost after the improved genetic algorithm was adopted is shown in Fig. 2 . 6 Case analysis This study verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method with an actual family simulation example. The example uses an energy management system that includes a grid, a PV distributed power source, energy storage equipment, and several loads. The system has only one distributed power source, which includes solar PV power generation equipment. The load has a refrigerated hot air conditioner, a storage water heater, a washing machine, a dishwasher, a rice cooker, and an EV.

To clarify the advantages of the proposed methods, the effect of the proposed adaptive method is compared with the effects of other algorithms, including GBPSO, original adaptive GA, and GA, as shown in Fig. 3 and Table 1 . The figure and table show that although the GBPSO and original adaptive GA can improve the iterative convergence performance of the GA, they still cannot achieve the global optimal solution when compared with the performance of the new adaptive GA. To verify the advantages of the proposed method, the robustness of the improved genetic algorithm is compared with the original adaptive genetic algorithm in (Zheng et al., 2018). For the first-stage optimization results, the program is run four times for comparison. In the initial example, λprice = 0, w price = 0.5, R I i = 0 , and i ∈ air, heater, EV, uninteruptable load . Because this study does not involve a prediction algorithm, for the sake of convenience, we assume 3 σ 1 ( t ) = μ 1 ( t ) , 3 σ 2 ( t ) = μ 2 ( t ) , a ( t ) = b ( t ) = 1 , and P PV, mean ( t ) = P PV, max ( t ) / 2 . P PV, mean ( t ) is expressed as the expectation of PV power generation per hour. The initial number of colonies in the genetic algorithms is 60, and the maximum evolutionary algebra is 1500. Figs. 4 and 5 show the results after four trials. For the traditional adaptive genetic algorithm, although the convergence state can be reached in the final stage of the program operation, the results of each operation after four runs have certain differences, indicating that the traditional adaptive algorithm can solve the local convergence to some extent. The robustness of the algorithm, however, needs to be improved. For the improved adaptive genetic algorithm, the results of the program after four trials are more stable than the adaptive genetic algorithm, indicating that the improved adaptive algorithm did have a certain improvement to the robustness of the algorithm. 6.2 Analysis of the second-stage optimization results The second-stage optimization is carried out based on the first stage. The optimization of the second stage is performed to find a better solution from the multiple solutions of the first stage, and the constraint condition processing function related to the first stage is needed. The comparison of the power exchange between consumers and the utility is shown in Fig. 6 . After the second-stage optimization, the process obviously can smooth the power fluctuation and reduce the peak of power exchange. Therefore, this reduces the risk of a power supply shortage when several households purchase electricity during the time periods in which the electricity price is low. To verify the superiority of the genetic algorithm improvement measured, this study changes the variable of the improved genetic algorithm to a fixed value. Figs. 7 and 8 show the comparison results after three attempts. After the action of the adaptive penalty function and the fixed penalty function, the fluctuation of the user-purchased power can be reduced. The genetic algorithm with an adaptive penalty function has a better optimization effect and convergence reliability, and it is easier to jump out of the local optimal solution to find the global optimal solution. To further verify the effect of the second-stage optimization, the battery SOC is used as an example. (In the process of an electric vehicle travel, a battery SOC is described by 0.) As shown in Fig. 9 , solution diversity exists in the EV battery SOC after the first-stage optimization. After the second-stage optimization, as shown in Fig. 10 , the solution diversity of the battery SOC is suppressed. Compared with the original solutions from before the optimization, the result after the optimization is more stable than the original result. 6.3 Robustness analysis with uncertainties The effect of the algorithm is evaluated for a certain circumstance. However, when uncertainties are considered, more surveys are needed to test the robustness. To evaluate the robustness of the algorithm with uncertainties, we propose two situations: for the first situation, λ price = 1 , and for the second situation, λ price = - 1 . The first situation occurs when consumers have an optimistic attitude toward consumption, believing that the next day\u2019s electricity prices and the unadjustable loads will be the lowest and that the solar energy production will be the highest. In the opposite situation, the consumers have a more conservative attitude. Figs. 11\u201314 show the comparison. When consumers consume power with an optimistic attitude, the net cost is reduced sharply in contrast to the more conservative attitude. It is obvious in the figures that the power fluctuation under the circumstance of λ price = - 1 is smoother than that of λ price = 1 . When users believe more solar energy is available, this will be transferred by the battery for the time periods in which prices are low, causing a higher peak in power consumption. The figures show that the algorithm has a stable state of convergence in different situations whether the user has an optimistic attitude or a pessimistic attitude. 6.4 Risk index analysis Because this paper introduces an analysis of the risk index, the energy management system is discussed for the case of different risk indexes. 6.4.1 Temperature risk index A water heater is taken as an example to illustrate the impact of the temperature risk index weight changes on the scheduling plan, as shown in Fig. 15 . Fig. 15 shows that as the user demands a higher temperature risk index, the higher the hot water temperature in the water heater is when using hot water, the better the resistance is when the user uses extra water. Table 2 also shows that a higher risk index causes more net electricity expenditure for the user, which is a sacrifice of the increased risk index. 6.4.2 Time risk index Different time risk indexes have an impact on the start-up time of the uninterruptible load. A washing machine is taken as an example, as shown in Fig. 16 . We consider only the circumstance of R I load , end resisting the possibility of washing clothes earlier. It is evident from the figure and the table that a larger R I load , end causes a larger expenditure and a better ability to resist this uncertainty (Table 3 ). 6.4.3 Power risk index The change in the weight of the power risk index has an impact on the optimization result of the battery capacity of the EV, as shown in Fig. 17 . When the user demands a higher power consumption risk index, the electric vehicle battery stores more power, and the battery has a better resistance when the user travels for an extra journey. At the same time, Table 4 also shows that when the risk index is high, the net consumption of the electricity for users is larger, which also results in a sacrifice of the increased electricity risk index. 6.4.4 Electricity price risk index When users adopt different electricity price risk indexes, the indexes will have different impacts on the user\u2019s electricity purchase plan. Here, λprice = 0, λprice = −0.5 and λprice = 0.5 are discussed; w price and λprice are represented linearly as w price = −0.5 λprice + 0.5. The change in expenditure and the change in power exchange with the grid are shown in Table 5 and Fig. 18 . Here, the worst case is defined as the case in which the user\u2019s electricity tariff is the highest, which means the renewable power generation is the least, the unadjustable load is the highest, and the electricity price is the highest. With an increase in the user\u2019s acceptance of risk, the user will think that the power purchased from the grid is reduced, and the net expenditure expected by the user will be reduced, but the applicable situation is more suitable for an optimistic forecast. For situations in which the predicted value is more pessimistic, the acceptance of the degree of risk should be minimized. 7 Conclusion This paper describes the construction of a multi-objective energy management model that considers household electrical comfort and risky economic cost, and the proposal of an improved genetic algorithm solving process. The results of the numerical examples show that the method we propose has several advantages compared with other methods. 1 The improved genetic algorithm can effectively solve the problems of the slow convergence and local convergence of traditional genetic algorithms, has high stability, and can obtain better household electricity optimization results. 2 The method we propose not only considers the right to judge the risk cost, including the electricity comfort cost and potential electricity consumption fee that can be controlled by consumers, but also reduces the risk of power supply shortage by reducing the PAR of power consumption. 3 The improved algorithm can be applied to a second-stage optimization of the method with an adaptive penalty function. 4 This study adopts a simplified calculation form of CVaR to evaluate the potential electricity cost. 5 This study applies a case analysis from a household to test the adequacy of the algorithm. The data we acquired came from a true household in Tianjin. Besides, all the predictable information has been predicted and verified according to true weather information and human habits. The method we propose classifies the risk of HEMS. The RI of electrical appliance and potential risk cost are illustrated separately. It is also worth noticing that the work we propose can be applied to a day-before scheduling period. Besides simulation, our work has been applied in Research on Key Technologies of home energy management system based on Internet in Jiangsu Province. The research has proved the method we propose can have a good effect on HEMS. Additionally, some improvements can be further developed for our research. For the second-stage optimization, the measures of adaptive penalty function still do not improve the robustness of the algorithm as well as the first-stage optimization does. When the CVaR function was selected to quantify the user\u2019s risk to the objective function, a linear function was simply selected to describe the relationship between the weight coefficient w and the user risk. The specific functional relationship needed to be obtained through multiple attempts with different typical types for users. In addition, further research can be carried out for real-time control in our research. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors report no declarations of interest.

        "dc:description": "With the popularization of smart power consumption technology, users can optimize the use of electrical equipment through a home energy management system (HEMS), thereby reducing electricity costs while maintaining a degree of comfort. In this study, we established an HEMS with distributed power and an electrical vehicle, describing a multi-objective optimization model with risk cost and risk index constraints, which have not been considered in previous work. The problem can be solved with improved genetic methods. First, this study establishes a mathematical model for the typical electrical equipment of specific smart home users. On this basis, with the user\u2019s electricity consumption cost and risk index being considered, we propose a multi-objective optimization model of the user\u2019s overall satisfaction and the corresponding constraints of the various devices in the home. This model is regarded as a two-stage optimization considering both electricity cost and power fluctuation. Finally, we verify the effectiveness of the model and the optimization algorithm through example simulations.",
