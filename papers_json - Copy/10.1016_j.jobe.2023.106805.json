School of Energy and Power Engineering Changsha University of Science and Technology Changsha 410114 China The optimal control of heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems affects people's living and building energy consumption. Many studies have introduced personal thermal sensation into the air-conditioning system to reduce energy consumption while improving the indoor thermal environment. However, there are limitations that require multiple adjusted temperature settings to create a room thermal environment that meets personal thermal comfort needs, and the impact of room temperature set values on air-conditioning energy consumption is often ignored. This study proposes an indoor temperature preference setting control method (ITPSCM) for thermal comfort and energy saving based on reinforcement learning (RL), which uses personal thermal comfort and the energy-saving effect of the system as the reward function. Q-learning is employed to obtain optimized room temperature settings to meet users' temperature preferences. Several comparative experiments are carried out in an indoor environment control testbed, and the experimental data is used to train the RL algorithm. As the results show, compared with the temperature set value-based control method, the ITPSCM can realize an indoor thermal environment that meets personal thermal comfort preferences in the early stages of air-conditioning system operation. With just the thermal comfort as a reward, 22.34% of daily energy consumption can be saved; with both the thermal comfort reward and energy-saving effect reward are considered, 26.48% of daily energy consumption can be saved. Keywords Indoor temperature Thermal comfort Energy consumption Smart control Reinforcement learning Data availability Data will be made available on request. 1 Introduction As people spend about 90% of their time indoors [1], the indoor conditions of buildings are a necessary part of the personnel living environment, and buildings account for about 40% of global energy consumption [2]. Heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, which are mainly responsible for providing a satisfactory thermal environment in buildings, are the major energy consumers within buildings, accounting for 40\u201360% of the energy demand [3]. Therefore, thermal comfort and HVAC system energy consumption are the primary concerns of building smart artificial environments and intelligent HVAC systems. In fact, most buildings use the static temperature set value-based control method for air-conditioning systems, which requires managers to continuously monitor the HVAC system's behavior and set a suitable room temperature set value according to the relevant standard during the operation. However, under this control method, constant temperature set values are used to construct the room thermal environment, which ignores the individual preference of personal demand. In order to improve this situation, many studies have been published on introducing thermal sensation into the HVAC system operation strategy to achieve the optimal control of people-centric HVAC systems [4\u20136]. However, such a control method must obtain the accurate thermal sensation of personnel. Chaudhuri et al. [7,8] explored the possibility of predicting personal thermal sensation through physiological parameters, and then proposed a thermal state evaluation model with a skin temperature and gradient feature. It is possible to obtain satisfactory personal thermal sensation prediction (TSP) results using the local physiological parameters from different body positions [9\u201311]. With the development of infrared technology, some researchers have utilized infrared thermography to monitor the body's facial temperature, then predict personal thermal sensation using a specific algorithm [12\u201317]. Nevertheless, the identification accuracy of this method is limited when the occupant is far from the location of the monitoring device or in a state of motion, resulting in unstable TSP results. Other scholars have studied the use of wearable devices to monitor physiological parameters and predict personal thermal sensation, finding this method more accurate and reliable [18\u201320]. Developing a fast and accurate prediction model of personal thermal sensation is significant for achieving the optimal operation control of HVAC systems to better meet personal requirements. Some scholars predicted personal thermal comfort by using a wristband device to obtain the physiological parameter, then performing timely temperature set value changes, which was shown to save energy consumption while improving the occupants' thermal comfort level [21,22]. Li et al. [23,24] put forward a neural network model for predicting room temperatures, which can more effectively achieve the control of indoor thermal environments. Xiong et al. [4] developed an adaptive thermal comfort model to enable the construction of a personalized indoor thermal comfort environment that can be applied to actual building systems. By introducing personal TSP into the operation strategy of HVAC systems, the energy consumption of air-conditioning can be reduced while improving the satisfaction of personnel. With the development of machine learning algorithms, reinforcement learning (RL) as a branch of machine learning in the artificial intelligence category has been widely applied in actual control engineering. In recent years, some researchers have begun to focus on RL as a possible control method for HVAC systems because it can handle HVAC systems with time delays. Costanzo et al. [25] proposed a data-driven building climate control method based on RL and verified it in the laboratory, showing that it could converge within 20 days and obtain a 90% optimal solution for different outdoor air temperatures. Yu et al. [26] applied deep RL to building energy management systems and developed an energy management algorithm based on deep deterministic policy gradients which had good effectiveness and robustness when the thermal dynamics model was not built and there were many parameter uncertainties. On the other hand, some studies used RL to optimize window opening and closing time, and the results indicated that the control method enabled the improvement of the indoor thermal environment and air quality [27,28]. Moreover, researchers optimized HVAC system units by using RL to reduce the energy consumption of the air-conditioning. Nagarathinam et al. [29] put forward a multi-agent RL algorithm by adjusting the set values of air handling units and chillers, which not only improved comfort but also reduced energy consumption by 17%. Zou et al. [30] realized the optimal control of air handling units using deep deterministic policy gradients, which achieved energy reduction based on maintaining a 10% prediction discomfort percentage compared with actual energy consumption. Valladares et al. [31] proposed an RL agent for the combined control of ventilation fans and air-conditioning units in subtropical environments without heating. Other researchers attempted to optimize the operation strategy of HVAC systems to improve indoor thermal comfort while decreasing energy consumption. Gao et al. [32] developed a deep deterministic policy gradient-based HVAC system optimal control method that achieved the reduction of laboratory energy consumption while maintaining indoor thermal comfort through the combinatorial regulation of the temperature and humidity set values. Yuan et al. [33] put forward an RL-based model-free control strategy that combined rule-based and RL-based control algorithms as well as a complete process, resulting in the RL controller performing the best in terms of both the discomfort time and energy cost of the air-conditioning system. Gupta et al. [34] suggested a residential building HVAC system control method based on model-free RL that could save energy costs and reduce thermal discomfort. The above studies indicate that needn't build an accurate HVAC system mathematical model when applying the RL method to the HVAC system smart control process. Most existing control methods involve introducing personal thermal sensation to HVAC systems, which is achieved to save energy while satisfying the thermal comfort needs of personnel. However, there is still much room for improvement in its control performance and energy-saving effect. First, multiple adjusted temperature set values are needed to meet the thermal comfort needs of personnel in early HVAC system operation. If an air-conditioning system can remember personal preferences for room temperature set values, it can quickly achieve temperature setting during operation and ensure system efficiency and stability. Second, most existing control methods take meeting human thermal comfort as the primary goal and do not include energy consumption in the control algorithm, so there remains further potential for energy-saving. To solve the problem that the temperature value can be set according to the occupants' preferences, obtain and learn the occupants' personalized setting characteristics of the room temperature set value and consider the influence of the room temperature set value on the system's energy-saving effect, this paper proposes an indoor temperature preference setting control method (ITPSCM) for thermal comfort and energy saving based on reinforcement learning that can drive the optimal regulation of air-conditioning systems through actual operation data. Experiments are conducted to complete the training of the RL model for room temperature setting with the obtained experimental data, and ultimately verify the effectiveness of the ITPSCM for air conditioning systems. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 1 makes a comprehensive analysis of the thermal comfort and energy-saving effects of the temperature set value; Section 2 introduces the ITPSCM and explains the experimental process; Section 3 presents and discusses the experimental results; and Section 4 draws conclusions, reviews limitations and looks ahead to future work. 2 Room temperature setting comprehensive effect analysis The room temperature influences not only human thermal comfort but also the energy consumption of air-conditioning systems. Existing studies have shown that increasing the temperature set value within the range of the room temperature comfort zone can reduce energy consumption of air-conditioning systems while ensuring personal thermal comfort [35,36]. Thus, it is possible to further optimize the energy-saving potential of air-conditioning systems by raising the temperature set value to meet the thermal comfort of the occupants. When the indoor air temperature is lower than the temperature of the most thermal comfort of personnel, increasing the room temperature set value means improving the energy-saving effect and increasing the occupants' thermal comfort to a certain extent. When the indoor air temperature is higher than the temperature of the most thermal comfort of personnel, increasing the room temperature set value means decreasing the occupants\u2019 thermal comfort. Therefore, the process of determining the room temperature setting for the air conditioning system can be divided into the following two cases. (1) The temperature set value should be set at room temperature corresponding to the optimal value of the occupants' thermal comfort point when only considering the occupants' thermal comfort. At this temperature, the energy-saving effect that the air-conditioning system is not optimal. (2) When the temperature setting takes into account not only the occupants' thermal comfort but also the energy-saving effect, we should first ensure that the occupants' thermal comfort is within the comfort zone, then appropriately increase the room temperature set value, making the sum of thermal comfort and energy-saving effect at their maximum at a certain room temperature. This temperature can effectively meet the occupants' thermal comfort needs while obtaining a better energy-saving effect at the same time. As such, in determining the room temperature set value process, we must first determine the comfort zone that can meet the occupants' thermal comfort needs. However, the temperature set value requires multiple adjustments to meet the occupants' thermal comfort needs during early air-conditioning system operation. In fact, personnel have good adaptability to ambient temperature, so the occupants' thermal comfort will lie within a fixed range. If the air-conditioning system can remember personal preferences for room temperature set values, it can quickly achieve air-conditioning temperature settings during operation and ensure efficiency and stability. Second, the setting of the temperature set value influences the occupants' thermal comfort and the energy consumption of the system, so the energy-saving potential can be further explored. Therefore, an RL algorithm is applied to the room temperature setting process and further research is carried out on the smart control of the room temperature set value in order to improve the energy-saving effect while maintaining the occupants\u2019 thermal comfort. The room temperature set value control conforms to the Markov Decision Process (MDP) in terms of three basic characteristics in the interaction process between the indoor environment and air-conditioning controller: first, the temperature value selection only relies on the current room temperature and the occupants' thermal sensation state, which are independent of the previous room temperature and the occupants' thermal comfort state; second, the temperature set value output decision is completely made by the air-conditioning system controller, enabling it to change the room temperature and the occupants\u2019 thermal sensation state by adjusting the room temperature set value; and third, the interaction process between the indoor environment and the air-conditioning system controller is based on the time dimension, which means that the environment state will change with the passage of time after the controller outputs the control command of the room temperature set value, and the cycle will be repeated when it senses a new environment state. Therefore, the control process of temperature setting can be regarded as a classical MDP, and the RL method can be used to achieve the energy-efficient regulation of room temperature settings. 3 Method RL is an intelligent method for obtaining habitual behaviors that maximize benefits based on external stimuli and perfecting its learning ability through continuous trial and error to achieve continuous optimal control [37]. Fig. 1 shows a typical information interaction process between the agent and environment in the RL process. At moment t when the environment state is s t , the agent will implement action a t when observing the current environment state, which causes the environment state to change to s t+1, for which the agent will be rewarded with reward r t+1. The policy π is a mapping relation that exists in the RL process that is a state corresponding to an action or taking different actions with different probabilities. The RL agent begins with a random policy that obtains a series of state, action and reward training samples and the goal is to seek out the policy that can maximize the reward, which can be expressed as: (1) { s 1 , a 1 , r 1 , s 2 , a 2 , r 2 , ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ , s t , a t , r t } Wherein s represents the environment state; a is the action that the agent will implement; r is the reward that the agent will be obtained. After obtaining a training sample, RL optimizes the policy based on the sample so that it obtains the optimal reward for the current sample. 3.1 Model construction In the interaction process between the indoor environment and the air-conditioning system controller, the controller will adjust the room temperature set value according to the current room temperature value and the occupants\u2019 group thermal sensation, then the air-conditioning system operation will change the room temperature state and the controller will calculate the corresponding reward based on its gathering of environment and thermal sensation data. The room temperature preference setting RL algorithm code was implemented in Python. The room temperature set value RL flow is shown in Fig. 2 . 3.1.1 Parameter setting The MDP represents the RL problem in terms of five constituent elements {S,A,P,R,γ}, wherein S is the state; A is the action; P is the state transition probability that describes the probability of the state transfer from s t to s t+1 after executing action a t ; R is the reward function that provides the reward obtained by taking action a t ; and γ is the discount factor, γ∈[0,1]. (1) State S t : In the temperature setting process, the controller makes a response according to the current moment indoors and the group thermal sensation. Hence, room temperature t r and group thermal sensation GTS are defined as state parameters in the RL model, then the state space at moment t can be defined as: (2) S ( s t ) = [ t r _ t , G T S t ] Wherein the room temperature is monitored by the relevant temperature sensors; the personal skin temperature and heart rate are collected by the wearable sensor. The data are transmitted to a smartphone APP to predict the individualized thermal sensation of personnel, and the individualized thermal sensation is expressed by ASHRAE 7-point scale [39], and then calculate the occupant's group thermal sensation through the multi-occupant thermal sensation fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method [40]. Finally, the calculation is uploaded to the controller through a smartphone APP. That group thermal sensation is a comprehensive representation of the individualized thermal sensation of all personnel in a controlled zone, which can reflect the group thermal comfort of the personnel in the zone. (2) Action A t : Defining the temperature set value as an action parameter, action a t starts to execute in state s t and changes to a t+1 when in state s t+1. All actions are selected from the action space, which at moment t can be defined as: (3) A ( a t ) = [ t s e t _ t ] (3) Reward R t : The thermal comfort and the energy-saving effect are defined as reward functions, wherein the thermal comfort reward of the evaluation is the group thermal sensation derived from the wearable device monitoring data; the energy-saving effect mainly considers the temperature set value, with a better energy-saving effect when the temperature set value is higher under summer conditions. Therefore, the reward at moment t can be defined as: (4) r t + 1 = f ( G T S t + 1 , t s e t _ t ) 3.1.2 Reward function In the process of using the RL model to solve the room temperature optimization problem, the reward function design will decide the implementation effect of the policy. The room temperature set value RL control algorithm takes two indices into account: thermal comfort and the energy-saving effect. Thermal comfort means that the room temperature needs to meet the thermal comfort needs of a majority of occupants, which is reflected in thermal comfort as far as possible approaching 0 (neutral); the energy-saving effect means that the room temperature set value under summer conditions should not be set too low but as high as possible based on meeting the thermal comfort needs. The two indices will interact during the process of room temperature set value RL algorithm operation, whereby improving the energy-saving effect means raising the room temperature set value, which will reduce the occupants' thermal comfort to some extent, but decrease the energy-saving effect when the occupants\u2019 thermal comfort is completely set as the control target. Hence, there need to be suitable rewards for thermal comfort and the energy-saving effect. 3.1.2.1 Thermal comfort reward The thermal comfort reward is mainly the reward value brought by the occupants' group thermal sensation. While designing the thermal comfort reward, the occupants' group thermal comfort should be between −1 (slightly cool) and 1 (slightly warm) as far as possible. The system will obtain a greater reward as the occupants' group thermal comfort approaches 0; the system will obtain a punishment value when the occupants\u2019 group thermal comfort is greater than 1 or less than −1. The formula for calculating the thermal comfort reward is shown in Equation (5): (5) R c o m f o r t = { 1 − | G T S | − | G T S | | G T S | ≤ 1 | G T S | ＞ 1 Wherein R comfort is the thermal comfort reward and GTS is the occupants' group thermal sensation. When the occupants' GTS value is 0, the R comfort value obtained by the system is at its maximum of 1. The R comfort value becomes smaller and smaller when the occupants' GTS is far away 0; and the R comfort value will be less than −1 when the occupants' GTS value is greater than 1 or less than −1. 3.1.2.2 Energy-saving effect reward The energy-saving effect reward is mainly the reward value brought by the room temperature set value size. To make the output value of the RL model more reasonable and reliable, and reduce the controller learning size, the rule of the change temperature set value is added when designing the energy-saving effect reward. GTS ≥ 0 indicates that the occupants are in a relatively hot state, so the room temperature set value should be adjusted downward. As far as possible, the adjusted room temperature set value should approach the current room temperature since the lower the room temperature set value, the higher the energy consumption of the air-conditioning system; that is, the system obtains a larger reward when the adjusted room temperature set value is closer to the current room temperature, and vice versa. GTS < 0 indicates that the occupants are in a relatively cold state, so increasing the room temperature set value. As far as possible, the adjusted room temperature set value should approach the upper limit value of the room temperature set value. As a result, as the room temperature set value approaches the upper limit value, the system receives a larger reward, and vice versa. The formula for calculating the energy-saving effect reward is shown in equations (6) and (7): (6) i f G T S ≥ 0 , R e n e r g y _ 1 = { 1 − | T s e t − T r | − | T s e t − T r | | T s e t − T r | ≤ 1 | T s e t − T r | ＞ 1 (7) i f G T S ＜ 0 , R e n e r g y _ 2 = { 1 − | T s e t − T s u | − | T s e t − T s u | | T s e t − T s u | ≤ 1 | T s e t − T s u | ＞ 1 Wherein R energy_1 is the energy-saving effect reward when GTS ≥ 0; R energy_2 is the energy-saving effect reward when GTS < 0; T set is the next moment room temperature set value; T r is the current moment room temperature; and T su is the upper limit value of the room temperature set value. Based on the above analysis, the sum of the thermal comfort reward and energy-saving effect reward are determined as the total reward of the room temperature preference setting RL control algorithm. The specific calculation formula is shown in Equation (8): (8) R t o t a l = { R c o m f o r t + β R e n e r g y _ 1 R c o m f o r t + β R e n e r g y _ 2 i f G T S ≥ 0 i f G T S ＜ 0 Wherein R total is the total reward; β is the proportion of the energy-saving effect reward to the total reward, β∈[0,1]. From Equation (8), we can see that we only consider the thermal comfort reward when β is equal to 0; when β is equal to 1, the thermal comfort reward and energy-saving effect reward have the same weight. 3.1.3 Q-learning algorithm In the RL process, it is necessary to find the optimal policy to obtain the maximum reward, and when the agent obtains accumulative rewards from moment t, it can be expressed as: (9) R t = r t + 1 + γ r t + 2 + ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ = ∑ k = 0 ∞ γ k r t + k + 1 Wherein γ is the discount factor γ∈[0,1], which describes the importance of future rewards to the current reward, and a smaller γ value means a smaller future reward weight. The state value function is the expectation of future accumulative rewards, and the accumulative rewards obtained in state s can be expressed as: (10) v ( s ) = E [ r t + 1 + γ v ( s t + 1 ) | s t = s ] In the process of seeking out the optimal policy, not only is the value of the current state considered but action is taken to obtain the value under the current state, and then the action that has the maximum value is selected. Thus, the action value function is defined as: (11) q * ( s , a ) = max q ( s , a ) = E [ r t + 1 + γ q max ( s t + 1 , a t + 1 ) | s t = s , a t = a ] The Q-learning algorithm calculates the optimal valuation of an action value function by the value iteration method, then calculates the error between the optimal valuation and the old valuation, and uses the error to update the Q-value by a similar gradient update method. The calculation formula is shown in Equation (12): (12) q ( s t , a t ) ← q ( s t , a t ) + α [ r t + 1 + γ max q ( s t + 1 , a t + 1 ) − q ( s t , a t ) ] In the calculation process of the Q-learning algorithm, a limited sample can be utilized to calculate the gradient and then the gradient can be used to update all Q-values and obtain the optimal policy by continuous iteration of the sample. The ε-greedy policy is selected as the policy in this paper; that is, selects a random policy by ε probability, then selects the greedy policy by 1-ε, where the ε value should be smaller. After the strategy training is completed, the agent can quickly find the action corresponding to the maximum Q-value reward in a certain state of the environment. The specific flow is shown in Table 1 . 3.2 Model learning and operation Based on the constructed room temperature preference setting RL model in the previous section, we first need to train the algorithm to obtain the optimal policy. The flow of the room temperature preference setting RL algorithm is shown in Fig. 3 . The room temperature preference setting RL algorithm learning flow can be divided into the following four steps. (1) Initializing the Q-table, setting the learning rate α, reward discount factor γ, exploration of probability ε and maximum iterations, etc. (2) Obtaining the current room temperature and the occupants' group thermal sensation, determining the room temperature set value relying on the ε-greedy policy, and enabling the system of air-conditioning to implement the room temperature set value to the next moment; (3) Monitoring the current room temperature and the occupants' group thermal sensation, calculating the reward obtained, and updating the Q-table; (4) If the maximum number of iterations has been reached, the learning is complete and the optimal policy is obtained; if the maximum number of iterations has not been reached, the learning is not complete and steps (2) and (3) should be repeated. The algorithm can be applied to the actual air-conditioning control system after obtaining the optimal policy of room temperature preference RL, the operation flow of which is shown in Fig. 4 . In the operation process of the room temperature preference setting RL, according to the current room temperature and group thermal sensation, the control system selects the room temperature set value that corresponds to the maximum Q-value, and the reward obtained when the system operates to the next state will further update the Q-table. With the increase of learning times, the control system can achieve effective room temperature and energy-saving regulation for different group thermal sensation states. 3.3 Experimental data-based RL algorithm training To evaluate the performance of the room temperature preference setting RL algorithm, a number of experiments were performed by using temperature set value-based control and TSP-based control under summer conditions, and the experimental data thus obtained was used to train and analyze the ITPSCM. 3.3.1 Experimental process The experiments were held in Office Rooms No. 1 to No. 3 at the Dalian University of Technology, China, which were equipped with a variable air volume system. Fig. 5 shows that the testbed has a construction area of about 160 m2, including one equipment room and three office rooms. Meanwhile, the field photo of the experiments and the heat transfer coefficient of the building envelopes are included in Fig. 5, and the basic information of office rooms are shown in Table 2 . The experiments were performed for 6 days in August 2020, in which 31 healthy subjects participated, and their basic information on the subjects was listed in Table 3 . For each subject, they took part in the experiments with stable physiological conditions and without any disease such as a cold or a fever. Meanwhile, they had good sleep and diet before the experiments. The number of days and the weather conditions under the two different control methods are similar. The subjects are divided into two groups of experiments performed, the first group with 15 subjects performed experiments over 4 days, and the second group with 16 subjects performed experiments over 2 days. Fig. 6 shows the time schedule of experiments. On each day, the experiment time was from 8:30 to 17:00, with 2 h to breaks. The subjects were required to perform regular office activities in the office room during the experiments, such as working and walking around. The subjects wore smart wristbands and submitted their satisfaction votes every 30 min on the smartphone app [41]. The smartphone APP could collect the real-time thermal feedback of indoor people and upload it to the air conditioning control system. The personnel could control the air conditioning system by inputting the temperature set point through the smartphone APP interface. The smartphone app room settings interface is shown in Fig. 7 . The temperature setting period was set at 30 min, meaning that the optimal room temperature set value was updated by the control system every 30 min. The initial room temperature set value was set at 25 °C for the two control methods with only the temperature set value changing and the other control operation strategies had the same settings for the system of air-conditioning. The variable air volume box controlled the supply airflow by utilizing the Proportional-Integral-Derivative algorithm according to the actual value and set value to control the room temperature. The parameters except indoor temperature need to be controlled to a certain range to reduce their influence on the thermal comfort of the personnel, including the relative humidity and CO2 concentration. During the experiments, the subjects were requested to wear a short-sleeve T-shirt without a jacket and trousers, so that the clothing insulation value was nearly 0.57 clo. The CO2 concentration was kept under 800 ppm, air velocity was controlled at less than 0.2 m/s and relative humidity was controlled between 40% and 60% during the experiment according to ARHRAE Standard 62.1 [42]. Appropriate sensors were used to monitor the environmental parameters every minute that equipment information is summarized in Table 4 . 3.3.2 Model training By collecting the experimental data, the variation range of room temperature T r was determined to be 24\u201330 °C, and the upper limit of temperature set value T su was set at 30 °C in the RL process. The variation range of the group thermal sensation was −3 to 3, since we did not obtain the group thermal sensation under all room temperatures during the experiment. In order to guarantee the completeness of the RL training algorithm, the linear interpolation principle was used to supplement the data to obtain the occupants' group thermal sensation under different room temperature states. To reduce the frequency of controller learning, the following rule of room temperature setting was introduced: the room temperature decreased when the occupants' group thermal sensation was greater than 0, and increased when the occupants\u2019 group thermal sensation was less than 0. To ensure the stability of the RL algorithm, the learning rate α was set at 0.1. During the room temperature control process, reward factor γ was set at 0.1 because the current reward obtained was mainly considered rather than the future reward. In addition, explore probability ε was set at 0.1 and maximum iterations were set at 1000. During the experiment, the initial room temperature for the three office rooms was set at 28 °C. The main reason is that the initial room temperature for the three rooms approached 28 °C under the temperature set value-based control and the TSP-based control systems. 4 Results and discussion During the experiment, the room and outdoor parameters and system energy consumption were monitored, and 1846 satisfaction votes were collected from the smartphone app. The experimental data was then used to train a room temperature preference setting RL model. To evaluate the performance of the ITPSCM for air-conditioning systems, the room temperature control performance, personal thermal comfort, and system energy consumption were compared and analyzed. 4.1 Model training results In order to analyze the output results of the optimal room temperature set value under different reward conditions, the β value was set in Equation (8). The first condition was that only the thermal comfort reward was considered (β = 0); that is, the occupants\u2019 group thermal sensation was met, which is the target of the room temperature setting, while energy consumption was not considered. The second condition was that the weight of thermal comfort and energy-saving effect was the same (β = 1); that is, the room temperature set value was assigned as far as possible to save the energy consumption of the air-conditioning system based on meeting the thermal comfort of the occupants. Fig. 8 shows the end state information for the room temperature set value (T set ) and group thermal comfort based on the RL system. When only considering the thermal comfort reward for the RL system (β = 0), the room temperature set value was set at the position where the group thermal comfort was closest to 0, which means that the occupants obtained maximum thermal comfort. When considering both the thermal comfort reward and energy-saving effect reward (β = 1), the room temperature set value in all office rooms increased, with an average increase of 0.3 °C. Meanwhile, the thermal sensation in Office Rooms No. 1 and No. 2 increased slightly, and the thermal sensation in Office Room No. 3 improved, but the distance from the optimal thermal sensation (0) remained the same. The variation in group thermal sensation was within an acceptable range, indicating that the occupants' thermal comfort was not widely reduced after considering the energy-saving effect reward. Therefore, the ITPSCM could achieve the effective and energy-saving operation of the air-conditioning system while ensuring the occupants\u2019 thermal comfort. 4.2 Experiment and simulation comparison The ITPSCM was trained on the experiment data, and the optimal room temperature set value was calculated by the model after training. The calculated results were then compared to the experiment of the temperature set value-based control and TSP-based control systems. The control performance and energy consumption were compared on two typical sunny days with similar outdoor air temperatures. The average outdoor air temperature under TSP-based control and temperature set value-based systems were 27.3 °C and 27.6 °C respectively. Fig. 9 shows the variations of the outdoor air temperature for the two different control strategies on a typical day. 4.2.1 Control performance Fig. 10 shows the variations of the room temperature set value (T set) for the three office rooms under the temperature set value-based and ITPSCM. Under temperature set value-based control, the average room temperature set value in Office Room No. 1 was 26.2 °C; that in Office Room No. 2 was 25.8 °C; and that in Office Room No. 3 was 25.2 °C. The average temperature set value in the three office rooms was 25.7 °C. For the three offices, the temperature set value under the two different reward functions of the ITPSCM all exceeded the room temperature set value under temperature set value-based control. Office Room NO.3 received more heat gain from outside at the same time due to the higher exterior wall area than Offices Room NO.1 and NO.2. In such a situation, the original static temperature set points no longer met the thermal needs of personnel. Thus, the user would set a lower temperature set point for rapid indoor cooling. However, the personnel often neglect to adjust the temperature to a suitable range when they entered the working state, which impacted both the thermal comfort of the occupants and the energy consumption of the air-conditioning system. Comparing temperature set value-based control, when ITPSCM only considered the thermal comfort reward (β = 0), the room temperature set value in Office Room No. 1 increased by an average of 1.4 °C, that in Office Room No. 2 increased by an average of 1.7 °C and that in the Office Room No. 3 increased by an average of 1.7 °C. The average room temperature set value of the three office rooms increased by 1.6 °C. When ITPSCM considered both the thermal comfort reward and energy-saving effect reward (β = 1), the room temperature set value in Office Room No. 1 increased by an average of 1.8 °C, that in Office Room No. 2 increased by an average of 1.9 °C and that in Office Room No. 3 increased by an average of 2 °C. The room temperature set value of three office rooms increased by an average of 1.9 °C. Fig. 11 shows room temperature set value variations under TSP-based control and ITPSCM. Under TSP-based control, the average room temperature set value in Office Room No. 1 was 27.4 °C; that in Office Room No. 2 was 27.5 °C; and that in Office Room No. 3 was 26.5 °C. The average room temperature set value in the three office rooms was 27.1 °C. It can be seen that the room temperature set value was multiply adjusted by the system relying on the indoor occupants\u2019 thermal sensation, then reached the stable room temperature set value. The number of adjustments to the room temperature set value in the afternoon was less than that in the morning, indicating that the TSP-based control system found the optimal room temperature set value after regulation in the morning hours, then stabilized. Under the ITPSCM, the control system calculated the optimal temperature set value that met the thermal comfort of personnel and minimum energy consumption according to the thermal comfort information of the personnel and the energy-saving effect. Since the personnel were well-adapted to the environment's temperature, the optimal temperature set value was used to control the indoor environment, which reduced the number of adjustments compared to TSP-based control; that is, the ITPSCM skipped the process of finding the optimal room temperature set value from the initial room temperature set value, which reduced energy consumption by adjusting the equipment power, thereby guaranteeing the system's stability to a certain degree and achieving better control performance. When the ITPSCM only considered the thermal comfort reward (β = 0), the room temperature set value in Office Room No. 1 increased by an average of 0.2 °C, that in Office Room No. 2 was the same and that in Office Room No. 3 increased by an average of 0.4 °C. The average room temperature set value of the three office rooms increased by 0.2 °C. When ITPSCM considered both the thermal comfort reward and energy-saving effect reward (β = 1), the room temperature set value in Office Room No. 1 increased by an average of 0.6 °C, that in Office Room No. 2 increased by an average of 0.2 °C and that in Office Room No. 3 increased by an average of 0.7 °C. The room temperature set value of three office rooms increased by an average of 0.5 °C. Under the two rewards of the ITPSCM, the average room temperature set value improved only slightly. The main reason is that the TSP-based control method introduced information about personal thermal sensation into the control process, which made the final room temperature set value of the TSP-based control method close to the room temperature set value under the ITPSCM only consider the thermal comfort reward. This indicates that the room temperature set value calculated by the ITPSCM was the optimal temperature set value that met personal thermal comfort. However, TSP-based control did not consider the energy-saving effect, whereas the ITPSCM can further exploit the energy-saving effect of the system based on meeting the thermal comfort requirements of personnel when the energy-saving effect reward is considered. 4.2.2 Personal thermal comfort analysis Fig. 12 shows group thermal sensation variations under the TSP-based control method and ITPSCM. Under the ITPSCM the optimal room temperature set value was calculated according to the thermal sensation of the indoor personnel. The occupants\u2019 group thermal sensation in the environment was between −0.5 and 0.5, indicating that they were working in a comfortable environment. Under the TSP-based control method, the indoor personal group thermal sensation had multiple adjustments because the initial room temperature set value could not meet the requirements of personal thermal comfort. The air-conditioning system adjusted the room temperature set value according to the real-time personal thermal sensation information to build the indoor environment that best met the personal demand. The personal group thermal sensation in the three office rooms experienced larger changes in the morning and tended to be stable in the afternoon, while the group thermal sensation value tended to fluctuate under the ITPSCM. The indoor thermal sensation when the ITPSCM considered both the thermal comfort reward and energy-saving effect reward (β = 1) was higher than when the ITPSCM only considered the thermal comfort reward (β = 0), with all values above 0. This indicates that the energy-saving potential of the air-conditioning system can be further explored by the appropriate improvement of personal thermal sensation in the range of thermal comfort when considering the energy-saving effect reward in the strategy. According to the above analysis, the indoor personal group thermal sensation can be stable between −0.5 and 0.5 under the TSP-based control method, but it needs to be adjusted to the environment for a long time according to personal thermal sensation. Since humans are good at adapting to environmental temperature, the system of air-conditioning regulated the office environment at the optimal temperature set value calculated by the ITPSCM according to the personal thermal sensation and energy-saving effect, creating a long-term comfortable indoor environment and reducing the influence of thermal sensation changes on the occupants. 4.2.3 Energy consumption comparison Based on the data of the room temperature set value and system energy consumption under the TSP-based control method and ITPSCM, a linear relationship equation was adopted to fit the amount of room temperature variation and energy consumption of the air-conditioning system. This was then used to estimate the energy consumption of the air-conditioning system under the ITPSCM. The fitting results are as follows: (13) Δ E = 0.146 + 9.30 Δ t Wherein Δt is the increment of the room temperature set value (°C), ΔE is the reduction of air-conditioning system consumption (kW), R 2 = 0.97 and RMSE = 1.14. This indicates that the linear equation can effectively predict the energy consumption amount of the air-conditioning system under room temperature set value variation. According to the experimental data, the daily energy consumption of the air-conditioning system was 67.29 kW when the average temperature set value was 25.7 °C under the temperature set value-based control strategy. According to Equation (13), the energy consumption of the air-conditioning system will be reduced by 15.03 kW when the room temperature set value is improved by 1.6 °C. When ITPSCM considers both the thermal comfort reward and energy-saving effect reward, the room temperature set value will improve by 1.9 °C and energy consumption will be reduced by 17.82 kW. Fig. 13 shows the daily system electrical power also called energy consumption for different control methods during manuscript recording. Comparing temperature set value-based control, 22.34% of the daily energy consumption can be saved when the ITPSCM only considers the thermal comfort reward (β = 0); and 26.48% can be saved when the ITPSCM considers both the thermal comfort reward and energy-saving effect reward (β = 1), with the energy-saving effect improved by 4.14%. Comparing TSP-based control, 2.84% of the daily energy consumption can be saved when the ITPSCM only considers the thermal comfort reward (β = 0); and 8.01% can be saved when the ITPSCM considers both the thermal comfort reward and energy-saving effect reward (β = 1), with the energy-saving effect improved by 5.17%. Comparing temperature set value-based control, the energy-saving effect was slightly improved when ITPSCM is compared with TSP-based control. This is because that thermal sensation was introduced into the operation process of the air-conditioning system under both TSP-based control and ITPSCM. However, the initial room temperature set value that meets the personal thermal preference can be used to directly regulate the indoor environment under the ITPSCM, which is higher than the temperature set value under the other control methods. The operation time of the system under the low temperature set value will be reduced, and the number of adjustments to the temperature set value will also be reduced, preventing energy consumption and device breakdown caused by multiple adjustments of device power, and thus reducing the operating energy consumption of the air-conditioning system and achieving a better energy-saving effect. To gain an intuitive exhibition of the experimental results under the three different control methods, environmental parameters, average thermal sensation and daily energy consumption are summarized in Table 5 . The results show that compared with the TSP-based control method and the temperature set value-based control method, the ITPSCM has more stable control performance and a better energy-saving effect based on effectively meeting indoor personal thermal comfort, giving it better practical application prospects. 5 Conclusion This paper analyzes the process of room temperature setting under both personnel and the air-conditioning system, then proposes an ITPSCM to solve the qualitative comprehensive evaluation problem of thermal comfort and the energy consumption of the air-conditioning system. The proposed method not only considers the occupants' preference of room temperature set value but also the influence of the room temperature set value on the energy consumption of the air-conditioning system. Compared with the control method based on temperature set points, the control method can achieve an indoor thermal environment that meets personnel's thermal comfort preferences at the early stage of air conditioning system operation, reduce the impact of thermal sensation continuous changes on users and improve the control performance and energy use efficiency of the air conditioning system. In the ITPSCM, the room temperature setting preference of the occupants and the energy-saving effect of the air-conditioning system are set as rewards; the room temperature and occupants' group thermal sensation are set as states; and the room temperature set value is set as an action. The influence of the ITPSCM under different weights for the thermal comfort reward and energy-saving effect reward is then compared. In order to research the effectiveness of the ITPSCM, experiments are performed on temperature set value-based and TSP-based control, and the experimental data obtained was used to train and analyze an RL room temperature preference setting model. The room temperature set value for meeting personal thermal comfort while maximizing the energy-saving effect was obtained by training the RL model, and the temperature set value was used to regulate the indoor environment in the early stages of air-conditioning system operation. In summary, the main conclusions include. 1) Compared with temperature set value-based control and TSP-based control, the ITPSCM can skip the process of finding the optimal temperature set value during the working time. The room temperature set value that meets both the occupants' thermal comfort preference and minimum energy consumption can regulate the indoor environment during air-conditioning system operation, reduce energy consumption and device wastage caused by multiple adjustments to the room temperature set value, guarantee the stability of the air-conditioning system and gain better control performance. 2) Temperature set value-based and TSP-based control can basically meet the occupants' thermal comfort demands, but there are still cases where personnel feel relatively cold or hot. The ITPSCM can obtain the preference setting features of the occupants online, regulate the indoor environment using the initial temperature set value to meet the occupants' thermal comfort demands, and avoid influence on the occupants due to continuous changes in thermal sensation caused by multiple adjustments to the room temperature set value. 3) The room temperature set value under the ITPSCM is greater than those under temperature set value-based and TSP-based control. When the ITPSCM only considers the thermal comfort reward (β = 0), 22.4% of the daily energy consumption of the air-conditioning system can be saved when compared with the temperature set value-based control, and 2.84% can be saved when compared with TSP-based control. When the ITPSCM considers both the thermal sensation reward and energy-saving effect reward (β = 1), 26.48% of the daily energy consumption of the air-conditioning system can be saved when compared with the temperature set value-based control; and 8.01% can be saved when compared with TSP-based control. The limitation of this study is that the linear relationship equation is used to estimate the energy consumption of the system by fitting the relationship between the room temperature set value and the historical energy consumption of the air-conditioning system, which can quantify the energy consumption of the system but differs from the actual energy consumption. Due to the experiment was conducted during the COVID-19 epidemic, the experiment period is relatively short, which was mainly limited by the number of volunteers and policies during the COVID-19 epidemic. Therefore, we will conduct the experiment over an extended period and carry out extended period simulation in our future work. An integrity experiment with the ITPSCM will be performed in an environment testbed to verify the effectiveness of this method. When the indoor temperature preference setting control method is applied in the air-conditioning system of the commercial building and the residential building, the thermal comfort of personnel and the energy-saving effect of the air-conditioning system will be improved, which will meet the demand of personnel optimal thermal comfort by minimum energy consumption and contribute to decreasing the energy consumption of the building.

        "dc:description": "The optimal control of heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems affects people's living and building energy consumption. Many studies have introduced personal thermal sensation into the air-conditioning system to reduce energy consumption while improving the indoor thermal environment. However, there are limitations that require multiple adjusted temperature settings to create a room thermal environment that meets personal thermal comfort needs, and the impact of room temperature set values on air-conditioning energy consumption is often ignored. This study proposes an indoor temperature preference setting control method (ITPSCM) for thermal comfort and energy saving based on reinforcement learning (RL), which uses personal thermal comfort and the energy-saving effect of the system as the reward function. Q-learning is employed to obtain optimized room temperature settings to meet users' temperature preferences. Several comparative experiments are carried out in an indoor environment control testbed, and the experimental data is used to train the RL algorithm. As the results show, compared with the temperature set value-based control method, the ITPSCM can realize an indoor thermal environment that meets personal thermal comfort preferences in the early stages of air-conditioning system operation. With just the thermal comfort as a reward, 22.34% of daily energy consumption can be saved; with both the thermal comfort reward and energy-saving effect reward are considered, 26.48% of daily energy consumption can be saved.",
