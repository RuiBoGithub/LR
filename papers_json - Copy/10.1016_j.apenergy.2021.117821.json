College of Civil Engineering Hunan University Changsha 410082 PR China The real-time energy matching between building load and PV generation is low in actual applications of photovoltaic direct-driven air conditioners (PVACs). The indoor thermal comfort temperature range (TCTR) can enhance the load flexibility of PVACs to improve the real-time zero energy probability. Therefore, a real-time zero-energy potential evaluation method with the adoption of TCTR for PVACs was proposed. The indoor temperatures are mainly determined by real-time PV generation, which minimizes the power taken from the grid and batteries. The indoor temperature, conditioned by PVACs under varying operating conditions, is predicted using machine learning models at a one-minute time resolution. The real-time energy matching performances of PVACs are evaluated by key indicators, including zero-energy probability, real-time zero-energy probability, complete overcooling rate, and complete overheating rate, for different climatic regions. With a fixed indoor setting temperature in summer, the real-time zero-energy probabilities in Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Beijing are 1.89%, 2.45%, and 2.11%, respectively. While adopting the TCTR with the similar PV capacity, the corresponding values in Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Beijing reach 53.13%, 49.48%, and 87.11%, respectively. In addition, the real-time zero-energy points frequently appear when large cooling demands are needed. Finally, an optimization of PV capacity is conducted. The optimal PV capacity was found to be at the point where seasonal PV generation is 1.3 times the dominant seasonal energy consumption. PVACs with TCTR can utilize the PV generation and load flexibility to the greatest extent and the evaluation method for PVACs is beneficial for designing a more practical and economical system.

China has now become one of the largest manufacturers and consumers of PV products in the world [2]. Unlike traditional fuel generation, which can be controlled over time, PV generation is subject to the variations of meteorological conditions and, consequently, cannot be regulated according to real-time load demand [3]. With a higher penetration of PV systems, more PV energy is left unable to be consumed in real-time by the users, which causes a serious level of solar PV curtailment [4]. The curtailment rate of PV generation reached 12.6% in China in 2015 [5]. Traditional solutions for changing the energy matching between PV generation and load demand, such as minimizing the load demand [6] or enhancing the solar energy supply [7], may exacerbate the solar PV curtailment problem. The reason is that the calculation periods for zero energy or energy matching is for a long time in existing definitions and reference, such as \u201cTowards Net Zero Energy Solar Buildings\u201d[8]. Due to the positive correlation between solar radiation and cooling load demands of buildings in summer, solar air-conditioning technologies could offer a great advantage in matching PV generation and building load demand [9]. As a typical solar air-conditioning technology, PV direct-driven air conditioner (PVAC) systems have attracted widespread attention due to their simple structure, lower capital investment requirement, and high Coefficient of Performance (COP) [1011]. Li et al. proved that the PV direct driven air conditioner system is a good solution for reducing the peak load of the grid in the summer and winter [12]. To maximize the energy efficiency of the PVACs in practice, Hernández JC et al. found that the real-time energy consumption of air-conditioners and PV generation should be as equal as possible to gain a higher self-sufficiency and self-consumption of PVACs simultaneously [13]. Hence, when designing PVAC systems, designers need to consider the real-time energy matching. In previous designs, the time resolution adopted for evaluating the energy matching of PVAC system designs is normally medium\u2013 and long-term (months or years). Chen et al. evaluated the energy matching ratio based on a monthly and yearly time resolution [14]. Li et al. analyzed the energy matching ratio based on a seasonal time resolution [15]. However, the energy consumption of air conditioners and PV generation varies with weather parameters that change on a much shorter time scale. Sunliang Cao and Kai Siren pointed out that matching the PV generation and energy consumption of buildings using only an hourly time resolution could generate significant errors [16]. The mismatching between PV generation and the energy consumption of air conditioners often occurs at an hourly or even minutely time resolution, even though a 100% energy matching degree may be reached at an annual time resolution [17]. Given the continuously increasing rate of PV penetration, the key problem for PVACs is improving the real-time energy matching between PV generation and energy consumption of air conditioners to realize a larger real-time zero energy probability. A larger real-time zero energy probability means that the real-time PV self-sufficiency and self-consumption of PVACs are high and the dependencies on energy storage devices and the utility grid are low. [18]. Face to the challenge, there is a range of methods for improving the degree of energy matching. Strengthening the power grid, and adding larger batteries or other energy storage devices have received much attention [1920]. Alvaro and Ricardo evaluated the PV generation with the adoption of energy storage systems (ESS). Compared with having only a PV system, a sharp drop of ESS costs is required to make the PV + ESS combination more affordable [21]. Koskela, Juha et al. reviewed studies PV + ESS, reducing the dependency on utility grid, and batteries, and found that maximizing the self-consumption and self-sufficiency of PVACs is the most cost-effective and practical solution in the present situation [22]. Adopting a thermal comfort temperature range (TCTR) can be an efficient way to improve the load flexibility to enhance the real-time self-consumption and self-sufficiency of PVACs without incurring additional costs [23]. The recommended PMV (Predicted Mean Vote) range in the ASHRAE standard 55\u20132010 has proved the validity of considering indoor TCTR [24]. Sami A. AL-Sanea and M.F. Zedan investigated the energy conversion of HVAC systems by optimizing the indoor setting temperatures of PMV in different regions [25]. Krarti et al. found that adopting the TCTR can save up to 38.7% of total annual electricity consumption for air conditioners without incurring any additional costs [26]. Johra et al. took advantage of indoor thermal comfort ranges to increase the seasonal COP of HVAC systems, ranging from 2.9 to 3.51 [27]. Woodyoung Jun and Farrokn Jazizadeh found that the median value of the energy saving potential is 20% using the comfort driven HVAC control based on the TCTR [28]. Christos D et al. investigated an optimization of TCTR with a renewable energy source system. The TCTR can be used as an efficient solution to narrow the matching gap of energy generation and consumption [29]. However, the existing literature mainly focused on adopting the TCTR for minimizing the total energy consumption to improve the ZEP based on a large time resolution, while its ability to improve the real-time energy matching for PVACs has rarely been reported [30]. Usually, a complex energy control system was needed to adjust the PV system, batteries, and utility grid to maintain a fixed indoor temperature, which results in poor energy efficiency and economic performance for PVAC systems. Li et al. analyzed the real-time energy matching degree of PVACs based on fixed indoor setting temperatures in different climatic regions [17]. The real-time energy matching and ZEP are seriously underestimated by only considering the fixed indoor setting temperature. Moreover, some design specifications, such as Technical Standard for Nearly Zero Energy Buildings, also ignored the adoption of TCTR with a large time resolution in their design [30]. The PV system and the energy storage devices are unnecessarily oversized in current methods. One of the reasons is that the control strategy of PVAC has not been changed. The indoor temperature is not dependent on the real-time PV generation. However, in the application of PVACs, the indoor temperature provided by PVACs does not have to be maintained at a fixed temperature, it can be accepted as long as it lies within the TCTR. We can change the indoor setting temperature to achieve a real-time matching between the PV generation and the energy consumption of air conditioners in this study. When PV generation is larger than the energy consumption of the AC system, users can lower the indoor setting temperature in summer to consume more of the PV-generated energy. The surplus PV energy can be converted into cooling capacity, which can be stored in the building thermal mass. When the PV generation is insufficient, users can raise the indoor setting temperature to reduce the energy consumption of the air conditioners. With this strategy, the real-time energy matching between the PV generation and energy consumption of the air conditioners can be improved without additional cost. This method can be beneficial for maximizing the self-consumption and self-sufficiency of PVACs and minimizing the capacity of batteries and PV systems. However, the real-time energy matching and ZEP of PVACs with TCTR has rarely been reported in existing studies. To investigate the real-time energy matching and devise a suitable control strategy for PVACs with TCTR, an accurate prediction of indoor temperatures of PVACs under variable operating conditions is important. However, establishing an accurate theoretical model of PVACs to predict the real-time indoor temperature based on the real-time PV generation is complex. It requires a complex and dynamic heat transfer process and comprehensive data in detail. There are many factors affecting the building load and predicted indoor temperature of PVACs, such as the outdoor meteorological conditions of the building, envelope structure and materials of the building, varying indoor heat source, control strategy of HVAC system, coefficient of performance of the system, and uncertainties in the whole simulation process. It is difficult to determine the interaction between each factor accurately and establish an accurate theoretical model. Many energy simulation software packages have been developed, which makes the energy simulation process more accurate and faster. Miguel Chang reviewed the trends in energy simulation tools and pointed out that energy simulation software can be more suited to dealing with planning future scenarios with high levels of variable renewable energy sources [31]. Using energy simulation software to predict the real-time indoor temperature conditioned by PVACs directly is difficult, therefore, energy simulation software with the help of machine learning methods is more suited to solving the problem with a higher prediction accuracy and calculation speed [32]. The multivariable linear regression [33], support vector machine (SVM) [34], artificial neural networks (ANN) [35], random forest [36], and XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boost) are the most common prediction methods [37]. Outdoor weather variables and indoor temperature set points of air conditioners are common inputs for the load prediction models [38]. Moreover, the time variables (hour of day and day type) play a significant role in the prediction accuracy of models [39]. Jonathan Reynolds et al. used the weather data, occupancy behavior, and heating temperature setpoints as inputs for several machine learning models, and found that optimal control based on such models can reduce energy consumption by around 25% [40]. Min Hee Chung et al. used weather data and predicted air temperature on a 1-minute time resolution, thus proving the potential for the application in the machine learning methods for creating a comfortable indoor thermal environment [41]. However, there is rare study of combining EnergyPlus and machine learning methods for predicting the real-time indoor temperature of PVACs and providing a complete real-time zero energy evaluation method based on the above work [42]. In summary, this paper provides a systematic evaluation method of the real-time zero-energy probability (ZEP) of PVAC systems with consideration of the thermal comfort temperature range (TCTR). Firstly, a large database was set using EnergyPlus to simulate the PV generation and the corresponding air conditioners\u2019 energy consumption based on varying the indoor temperature within a possible operation range. Secondly, different machine learning (ML) models were used to study the relationship between the PVAC load and the indoor temperature under various operation conditions based on the database. The indoor temperatures corresponding to 100% consumption of PV generation were obtained by the ML model with the highest prediction accuracy. Thirdly, a real-time ZEP evaluation method, including various indicators, was proposed for PVAC systems based on the new zero-energy concept, and the ZEPs were obtained with different time resolutions, climatic regions, and operation periods. Finally, sensitivity analysis of ZEP with various PV capacities was carried out to determine the optimal PV capacities for different climatic regions. The potential means of optimizing PVACs, such as increasing of PV capacity, increasing energy storage capacity, or changing the characteristics of the building envelopes, were discussed for different climatic regions. 2 Description of the building model and the PVACs model 2.1 The building model A rectangular office building with dimensions of 20m × 15 m × 8.4 m (see Fig. 1 ) was chosen in this study to investigate the energy matching performance between the energy consumption of air conditioners and the PV generation in three climatic regions. The cooling season for each region is from May to October and the heating season is from November to March. The normal working hours are from 8:00 am to 6:00 pm. The indoor temperatures vary atdifferenttimes of theday. The building envelope characteristics are designed to meet the public building energy efficiency design standards in China (Table 1 ). 2.2 The PVACs model A grid-connected PVAC system was adopted for investigating the ZEP, in combination with the thermal comfort temperature range (TCTR), in three climatic regions, during seasonal and annual operation periods. A schematic of the PVAC system with TCTR is illustrated in Fig. 2 [1]. In Fig. 2, the PV direct-driven AC means that the DC power generated by the PV systems is used by the air conditioners directly. The indoor temperature, conditioned by the PVAC, is mainly determined by the real-time PV generation. The utility grid plays a backup role to supplement the power required when the PV generation does not meet the requirements of the air conditioning unit. Moreover, the thermal comfort temperature range is considered to improve the load flexibility and the energy matching performance of PVACs. The thermal comfort indoor temperature can be from 23.9 °C to 28.3 °C in summer, and from 16.7 °C to 21.8 °C in winter [22]. It was assumed that the air conditioners work with a stepless speed regulation of frequency. The initial PV capacity was set at the level that would result in the total seasonal PV generation meeting the total dominant seasonal energy consumption of the air conditioners. In the hot-summer and cold-winter zones, as well as the hot-summer and warm-winter zones, the energy consumption of the air conditioner for cooling is dominant. For the cold region, the heating energy consumption is dominant. 3 Methodology To investigate the real-time ZEP of PVACs in different climatic zones and in different seasons, the key is to obtain the real-time indoor temperature provided by the PVACs. EnergyPlus struggles to complete the entire calculation process for real-time indoor temperature, and an accurate theoretical model of PVACs to predict the real-time indoor temperature is complex. Machine learning can work well together with an EnergyPlus simulation to predict the real-time indoor temperature quickly and accurately. After obtaining the real-time indoor temperature of PVACs, the corresponding real-time ZEP of PVACs can be calculated. Therefore, a three-stage methodology to calculate the real-time ZEP of PVACs is adopted. The calculation framework for the ZEP of the PVAC systems is shown in Fig. 3 . The following steps are followed: Step 1: the load demand of air conditioners under different indoor setting temperatures were simulated using EnergyPlus with a one-minute timestep to establish a load versus setting temperature database. The indoor setting temperature is considered equal to the indoor temperature of the building in EnergyPlus. In order to create a sufficiently large database and conform to the actual varying operation conditions, the indoor setting temperatures in the simulations were changed as would be required by any occupants. In this study, the indoor setting temperatures in different periods of the day were determined by random selection within the setting temperature range of the air conditioner. The energy consumption of the air conditioner, powered by the PV system, is equal to the heating/cooling load of the air-conditioner obtained in the simulation divided by its coefficient of performance. Step 2: machine learning models were used to learn and analyze the relationship between the outdoor ambient temperature, solar irradiation, indoor temperature, and energy consumption of the air conditioners, based on the database established in Step 1. Then, the predicted indoor temperature, conditioned by the PVACs that are powered by the real-time PV generation, can be obtained at a one-minute timestep under various operating conditions. In this step, all electricity generated by the PV system can be converted into the heating/cooling capacity output of the PVACs in real-time. Step 3: when the indoor temperature conditioned by the PVACs is within the thermal comfort temperature range (TCTR), this moment is regarded as the real-time zero energy time. ZEP is defined as the probability that the indoor temperature conditioned by PVACs is lower than the highest comfortable temperature for summer, or higher than the lowest comfortable temperature for winter, during the whole operation period. The ZEP of PVACs in the three climatic regions were calculated based on the different time resolutions in summer and winter. 3.1 Energy simulation The energy consumptions of the air conditioners were simulated in EnergyPlus using an ideal load air conditioning system model with a one-minute timestep. The adjacent hourly weather data were interpolated at shorter timesteps in EnergyPlus. To establish a sufficiently large database for training the machine learning models, a random selection of indoor temperatures ranging from 16 °C to 30 °C in summer, and 13 °C to 30 °C in the winter, were adopted. To conform to the actual varying operation conditions and considering the effect of previous indoor temperature changes, the indoor setting temperatures in the simulations should be changed during the day as required by the building occupants. The maximum energy consumption of the air conditioners for cooling and heating are consistent with the energy consumption characteristics in different climatic regions [1]. The rated cooling/heating capacities of the selected air conditioners are slightly higher than the maximum cooling/heating loads. The specifications of the air conditioners are given in Table 2 . 3.2 Machine learning models Since there are many factors affecting the building load and the indoor temperature of PVACs, such as the outdoor meteorological conditions, building envelope structure and materials, indoor heat sources, control strategies of HVAC systems, coefficient of performance of the HVAC system and various uncertainties, a theoretical model may struggle to determine the interaction between each factor and predict the indoor temperature accurately. Moreover, even as a very powerful simulation tool, EnergyPlus also has difficulties simulating and obtaining the real-time indoor temperature when the load demand is not matched with the ever-changing PV generation. On the other hand, machine learning methods can work well together with EnergyPlus to predict the real-time indoor temperature quickly. Moreover, different machine learning studies have used different ML models for load prediction. In this study, six popular machine learning models, namely Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Decision Tree Regression (DTR), K Nearest Neighbors Regression (KNN), Support Vector Regressor (SVM), Random Forest Regression (RFR), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), were used for predicting the indoor temperatures. XGBoost is a more advanced model, which combines multiple small predictors sequentially to enhance the prediction accuracy and generalization capacity. The research roadmap of ML model applications is shown in Fig. 4 . For the inputs, firstly, weather data including solar irradiance and outdoor temperature, and the energy consumption of the air conditioners as simulated in EnergyPlus, were set. Then, two time variables (hours of the day and months of the year) were added to reflect the building occupancy pattern, internal heat gains, envelope thermal inertia, and building usage schedule (such as the temperature set point). The whole dataset was divided into two parts \u2014 training (70% of the whole dataset) and testing (30%) dataset. Meanwhile, some important hyper parameters and defined hyper parameter spaces were selected for each ML model, and a grid search was adopted to optimize those models in Table 3 . The optimized key hyperparameters is beneficial for the machine learning models improve their prediction accuracy. The performances of different models were evaluated by the root means squared error (RMSE), which can show the regression errors of the indoor temperature and thus indicate which is the most suitable model. 3.3 Indicators of energy matching performance of PVACs Fig. 5 presents the hourly PV generation and energy consumption of the air conditioners for a PVAC system on a typical day in Shanghai. The daily PV generation and energy consumption of air conditioners are represented by the areas of P and L. This hourly energy matching is based on the fixed indoor setting temperature (25 °C). In Fig. 5, area A shows the deficit in the supply to the air conditioners, which can be provided by a battery or the utility grid, area B represents the surplus PV generation, which can be stored in the battery or fed back into the utility grid. The sum of the areas A and M represent the electricity consumption of the air conditioners, B and M together represent the total PV generation, while M is the PV generation utilized directly by the air conditioners. As shown in Fig. 5, the daily PV generation is larger than the energy consumption of the air conditioner. However, the hourly and real-time energy mismatching often occurs in the day. The adoption of the thermal comfort temperature range can improve the real-time energy matching of PVACs with no increase in cost. ZEP is defined as the probability that the indoor temperature conditioned by PVACs is lower than the highest comfortable temperature for summer, or higher than the lowest comfortable temperature for winter, during the operation periods. The general relationship for ZEP is shown in Eq. (1). The ZEPs are different for different time resolutions, and the selection of the time resolution depends on the application scenarios of the PVACs. Table 4 shows the descriptions of ZEPs for different time resolutions during different operation periods. Without any additional assistance with shifting the energy, the time resolution for the ZEP of PVACs needs to be minutely. With small energy storage devices that can shift the energy in an hour, the time resolution for the ZEP of PVACs can be hourly. With larger energy storage devices that can shift the energy in a day, the time resolution for ZEP of PVACs can be calculated at a daily resolution. (1) Z E P ( m , n ) = ∑ t _ ( T i ) ∑ t _ ( t pvac ) where t _ ( T i ) is the time when the indoor temperature is lower than the highest comfortable temperature in the summer, or higher than the lowest comfortable temperature in winter during the operation periods; t _ ( t pvac ) is the total operation time of the PVAC system; m is the operation period, which can be either hour or season in this study; n is the time-resolution of energy matching for PVACs, which can be minutely, hourly, or daily. It is almost impossible to achieve the real-time zero-energy goal by only using the real-time PV generation without any energy storage devices. A clear hourly variation of energy matching for PVACs is important. If, in a particular one-hour period, the indoor temperature is lower than the highest comfortable temperature in summer or higher than the lowest comfortable temperature in winter, that hour can be considered as a zero-energy hour. The zero-energy hour can be divided into the complete real-time zero-energy hour and the incomplete real-time zero energy hour. Complete real-time zero-energy hour means that all of the real-time indoor temperatures conditioned by the PVAC system meet the thermal comfort requirements in this hour. Incomplete real-time zero-energy hour means that not all of the real-time indoor temperatures can meet the thermal comfort requirements. Energy storage devices are needed to shift the energy during incomplete real-time zero-energy hours. Such energy storage devices with smaller capacities are desired in this study. Hence, RZEP is defined as the ratio of complete real-time zero-energy hours to total air conditioner running time, which is shown in Eq. (2). t complete is the complete real-time zero-energy hour, t pvac is the total operation time of the PVAC system. The purpose of this indicator is to calculate the complete real-time zero-energy hours probability of PVAC systems to determine the required energy storage device size. (2) R Z E P = ∑ t _ ( t complete ) ∑ t pvac In the actual operation, surplus PV generation often occurs during the complete real-time zero-energy hour. The thermal comfort indoor temperature can range from 23.9 °C to 28.3 °C in summer and from 16.7 °C to 21.8 °C in winter [22]. Hence, the hours for which the hourly indoor temperature of PVACs is lower than 23.9 °C are considered to be the overcooling hours. In winter, the hours for which the hourly indoor temperature is higher than 21.8 °C are regarded as the overheating hours. Similar to the classification of zero-energy hours, overheating/overcooling hours can also be divided into complete and incomplete overcooling/overheating hours. In a complete overcooling/overheating hour, there is some PV generation wasted every minute in that hour. Incomplete overcooling/overheating hours mean that a larger energy storage size is needed to realize a higher self-consumption of PV generation. COCP is defined as the ratio of complete overcooling hours to the total air conditioner running time in summer, which is shown in Eq. (3): (3) COCP = ∑ t _ ( T i < 23.9 ° C ) ∑ t pvac COHP is defined as the ratio of complete overheating hours to total air conditioner running time in winter, which is shown in Eq. (4): (4) COHP = ∑ t _ ( T i > 21.8 ° C ) ∑ t pvac 3.4 Indicators of economic performance of PVACs For air conditioners, the application of PV system will increase the initial investment to some degree. However, the electricity bill of the PVAC system paid to the utility grid can be reduced in a large extent, especially for the case with considering TCTR. Since the feed-in tariff of PV electricity is much lower than the retail price of purchasing electricity from the utility grid, the profits of PVAC is still considerable. To evaluate the economic performance of different systems, the payback times was calculated in this study. The operation conditions of air conditioners can be divided into three types, viz. air conditioners without PV systems (traditional air conditioners), air conditioners with a PV system but without considering the thermal comfort temperature range (TCTR) and air conditioners with a PV system and considering TCTR. During the calculation process, it was assumed that when PV generation was larger than the energy consumption of air conditioners, the surplus PV generation was sold to the utility grid. In addition, the subsidy from the government was not considered in the calculation because most of subsidies were curtailed around the world. Since air conditioners are essential for the buildings, we did not consider the initial investment of air conditioners in the calculation. The specific economic analysis are as follows: The total investment of the PV system is calculated by Eq (5). (5) L pv = W C pv where Lpv is the total PV investment (RMB); W is the installed capacity of the PV system (kW); Cpv is the cost per watt of the PV system (RMB/W). The anticipated operation years of the PV system are 25 in this study. For the air conditioners without connecting to a PV system, the annual investment of PV system is zero. The cost of purchasing electricity from the utility grid is calculated by Eq (6). The air conditioners with different operation conditions have different cost of purchasing electricity from the utility grid. (6) L cos t = Q a C a where Lcost is the cost of purchasing electricity from the utility grid (RMB); Qa is the purchasing electricity from the utility grid (KWh); Ca is the commercial electricity price (RMB/kWh). The profit of selling surplus PV generation to the utility grid is calculated by Eq (7). The air conditioners with different operation conditions also have different profits. (7) L sell = Q sell C s where Lsell is the profit of selling surplus PV generation to the utility grid (RMB); Qsell is the electricity selling to the utility grid from the PV system (kWh); Cs is the feed-in tariff of PV generation (RMB/kWh). If the air conditioners are not connected to a PV system, the profit of selling surplus PV generation is zero. The payback time the PV system of PVACs with or without considering TCTR is calculated in Eq (8) (8) P = L pv / L cos t w i t h o u t P V - L cos t w i t h P V A C + L sell where P is the payback time of the PV system (year); Lcost with PVAC is cost of purchasing electricity from the utility grid for air conditioners with a PV system (RMB); Lcost without PV is the cost of purchasing electricity from the utility grid for air conditioners without a PV system (RMB). The difference between Lcost without PV and Lcost with PVAC is the annual savings brought by the utilized PV generation. 4 Results and discussion 4.1 Validation of machine learning models Different machine learning models were used to predict the indoor temperature in the summer and winter. According to the results in Table 5 , the performance of the XGBoost Regressor model is the best in both the summer and winter, which have the lowest RMSE values of 0.853 and 0.669, respectively. Comparisons between the indoor temperature predicted by different ML models and the ground truth values were also discussed to assess the reliability of the results. The XGBoost Regressor model is in good agreement with the ground truth of the indoor temperature in Fig. 6 . Hence, the XGBoost regressor model was chosen to predict the indoor temperature in the summer and winter. 4.2 Summer performance 4.2.1 Performance at real-time time-resolution The summer real-time performances of PVACs are divided into three situations with different lower bound or upper bounds of temperature ranges, namely fixed indoor temperature (25 °C), flexible indoor temperature (<=25 °C), and flexible indoor thermal comfort temperatures (<=28.3 °C). The initial PV capacity is determined that the total PV generation is equal to the dominant energy consumption of the air conditioners. In the scenario of fixed indoor temperature in summer, the RZEPs of the PVACs in Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Beijing are 1.89%, 2.45%, and 2.11%, respectively. In the scenario of flexible indoor temperature (<=25 °C), the RZEPs in Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Beijing are 25.71%, 21.76%, and 49.61%, respectively. This strongly indicates that the traditional energy matching for PVACs with fixed indoor temperature limits the RZEP to a great content. In such scenarios, the capacity of the PV systems and batteries need be very large to realize real-time zero-energy. A significant amount of PV generation would be wasted or there would be high frequency battery charge\u2013discharge cycles. This finding is consistent with the current phenomenon of distributed solar systems. The adoption of the thermal comfort temperature range (TCTR) is an efficient and zero-cost method to improve the RZEP further. The RZEPs with TCTR in Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Beijing are 53.13%, 49.48%, and 87.11% in summer. The increases of RZEP are significant in all three climatic regions. Beijing has the highest RZEP in summer because the PV generation is larger than the energy consumption of the air conditioners used for cooling. However, the RZEP of Shanghai and Guangzhou is relatively lower since the total PV generation is just equal to the total energy consumption of the air conditioners in summer. In summer, insufficient real-time PV generation occurs more frequently in Shanghai and Guangzhou than in Beijing. Except for some scenarios in which there was insufficient PV generation, there were some moments when the PV generation was sufficient and the 100% consumption of PV generation is prone to an overcooling problem. Theoretically, a PVAC system with a higher RZEP has a higher complete overcooling rate (COCR). The COCRs in Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Beijing are 18.25%, 7.69%, and 29.40%, respectively. The energy mismatching problem can be resolved by adding batteries, increasing PV capacity, or changing the load characteristics of the buildings. 4.2.2 Performance at hourly time-resolution To improve the RZEP through additional measures, the ZEPs of PVACs in different climatic regions are investigated based on an hourly time resolution. The hourly average indoor temperatures are selected to describe the hourly energy performance. If the hourly average indoor temperatures meet the thermal comfort requirements, the PVACs can realize the real-time zero-energy goal with energy shifting during this hour. Fig. 7 shows the distribution of hourly average indoor temperatures of different cities in summer. The blue, cyan, and red parts represent the operation conditions of overcooling (the indoor temperature below the TCTR), thermal comfortable, and heat points (the indoor temperature is above the TCTR) for the PVACs, respectively. The zero-energy area contains the thermal comfortable and overcooling points. The ZEPsummer,h of Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Beijing are 73.86%, 74.78%, and 89.62%, respectively. As the time resolution increases, the increase of ZEP value is different for each city. The increase of ZEP from the real-time resolution to hourly time resolution indicates the effect of the energy storage devices. In this analysis, the main energy storage devices are batteries. For Beijing, the small increase of ZEP indicates that the batteries play a limited role in increasing the RZEP in summer. The increase of ZEP in Shanghai is close to that of Guangzhou. However, compared to Shanghai, the overcooling points in Guangzhou show asubstantiallylowerzero-energy probability. These findings indicate that the PV generation of the PVACs in Guangzhou can be consumed in a timely manner. A larger PV capacity is the primary solution for improving the real-time ZEP in Guangzhou. Adopting a small size battery can further improve the real-time ZEP in Guangzhou. Shanghai has the median overcooling rate and the lowest ZEPsummer,h among the three cities. Larger batteries are needed to shift energy based on a larger time resolution. The previous analysis of energy performance is based on the ZEPsummer,h value, a clearly understanding of real-time energy matching variation for PVACs can show more messages for designing a PVAC. Fig. 8 shows the variations of ZEPhour,m in the form of box plots. The box plots are used to visualize the statistics of the ZEPhour,m values for all operation hours in the summer [2]. The plots are composed of the minimum points, lower quartile points, median points, mean points, upper quartile points, and maximum points, which can depict the distributions of the ZEPhour,m values. The different colors of the boxes reflect the ZEPhour,m at different hours of the day in the season. The distributions of the ZEPhour,m can be obtained by three steps. Firstly, the ZEPhour,m values were calculated based on the real-time indoor temperature per hour. Secondly, we put all the ZEPhour,m at the same hour into an array, thus 24 arrays for each hour were obtained. Thirdly, the distributions of each array were presented in a box plot. We can get two important pieces of information from the box plots of ZEPhour,m. Firstly, most of the ZEPhour,m around noon are equal to 1 in all cities because the PV generation is high in this period. Considering that indoor thermal comfort has a strong effect on reducing the energy consumption of air conditioners in large cooling demand times. To further explain the effect of TCTR, the hourly energy matching on June 1st is shown in Fig. 9 . Compared with the energy consumption of air conditioners with 25 °C, the energy consumption of air conditioners decreases significantly with 28.3 °C. In addition, the operation times of air conditioners are also drastically reduced. From Fig. 10 , the corresponding indoor temperatures conditioned by PVACs with a large PV generation are lower than 25 °C around noon. Due to the heat storage capacity of the building envelopes and the large amount of PV generation, the indoor temperatures conditioned by PVACs are also lower than 28.3 °C in the afternoon. Therefore, the PVACs with TCTR have a strong effect on improving real-time ZEP of air conditioners, especially at noon and in the afternoon. Secondly, the energy performance of the PVAC system in each city has its own characteristics. The situation of ZEPhour,m equaling to 1 occurs more for the PVAC system in Beijing due to the relatively low cooling load demand. It is evident in Fig. 8 that the distributions of ZEPhour,m are similar in Shanghai and Guangzhou, while the median of ZEPhour,m in Guangzhou is higher than that of Shanghai in the noon and afternoon. The reason is that the solar irradiation began to decrease gradually in Shanghai in the afternoon, but it remains stable in Guangzhou. Overall, the results indicate that the PV generation can effectively cover the largest cooling load at noon. The PVACs can help buildings reduce the electricity importation from the utility grid during the peak load period. In general, the zero energy points appear around noon for PVACs with TCTR. This result indicates that the PV generation can effectively cover the largest cooling load of the day, which occurs at noon. The PVACs can help buildings reduce the electricity imported from the grid during the peak load period. The economic benefits of buildings will be better, and the burden placed by buildings on the utility grid can be reduced. Thus, the application of thermal comfort temperatures for PVACs is a win\u2013win choice for buildings and utility grids. 4.3 Winter performance 4.3.1 Performance at real-time time-resolution The winter real-time zero energy probabilities for PVACs with a fixed indoor temperature (20 °C) in Shanghai and Beijing are 1.04% and 0.62%, respectively. Since the RZEP is extremely low for the fixed indoor temperature scenario, the cost will be very high to increase RZEP by using batteries. Considering the indoor temperature range (>=20 °C) scenario, the RZEP values of the PVACs increase to 63.49% and 23.2% in Shanghai and Beijing, respectively. These increases of RZEP are significant. Taking the thermal comfort temperature range (>=16.7 °C) into account, the RZEP of PVACs in Shanghai and Beijing are 74.24% and 45.2%, respectively, which represent further improvements. The winter RZEP growth rate of Beijing is higher than that of Shanghai due to a larger heating demand in Beijing. The complete overheating rate (COHP) of Shanghai and Beijing are 51.35% and 28.08%, respectively. The smaller COHP in Beijing indicates that the increased PV generation can improve the RZEP of PVACs in Beijing in winter. 4.3.2 Performance at hourly time-resolution Fig. 11 describes the distributions of mean hourly indoor temperatures of PVACs in Beijing and Shanghai in winter. The blue, cyan, and red parts represent the winter operation conditions of cool (the temperatures are below TCTR), thermal comfortable, and overheating points (the temperatures are above TCTR) of PVACs, respectively. The ZEPwinter,h values are 90% and 57.2% in Shanghai and Beijing, respectively. The ZEP growth of Shanghai is higher than that of Beijing from minutely to hourly time resolution. Hence, the PV capacity is enough to realize 90% ZEPwinter,h in Shanghai, and small size batteries can further improve the RZEP in winter. Fig. 12 shows the ZEPhour,m variations during working hours in winter. From Fig. 12, two important pieces of information can be obtained. On one side, most of real-time zero energy points appear around noon due to the lower energy consumption and large PV generation in Beijing and Shanghai. However, the larger energy consumption for heating cannot be satisfied by the lower PV generation in the morning and afternoon. On the other side, the overall work effect and duration of the PVACs are different in different cities depending on the initial PV capacity. For Shanghai, the cool points are only 10% of the total operating points and the overheating rate is high in winter. The problem of insufficient energy consumption in Shanghai can be solved by adopting small size batteries in winter. For Beijing, the frequency of the cool points is larger. Moreover, the PVAC in Beijing exhibits a negative correlation between PV generation and energy consumption of air conditioners for heating, and operate during a longer heating period [1]. Only increasing PV capacity has a limited effect on improving the real-time ZEP in Beijing. Moreover, the ZEPsummer,h value in Beijing is 89.62% in summer with the initial PV capacity. The PV generation is enough to cover the energy consumption of air conditioners for cooling. Considering the aforementioned performance in summer and the larger energy mismatching in winter mornings and afternoons, changing the heating demand trend to decrease the energy mismatching degree through passive methods might be a suitable solution to improve the ZEP in Beijing. 4.4 Optimization of PVACs To further increase the real-time ZEP, an optimization study on PV capacity was conducted. The PV capacity was increased by 10% increments. Based on different time resolutions, the ZEP values of PVACs and corresponding complete overcooling/heating rates in winter and summer were calculated under the premise that the total PV generation is one to two times the total energy consumption. From Fig. 13 , it is clear that all the ZEP values of the PVACs improve steadily with the increase in PV capacity at different time resolutions in summer. However, the changes in growth rates of ZEP when moving from a real-time time resolution to a daily time resolution are different for the different regions. At the upper bound of the optimal range of PV capacity, the summer RZEP in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou increase by 6.1%, 13.56%, and 17.21% respectively. The ZEPsummer,d values increase by 6.76%, 18.22%, and 16.82%, respectively. Only in Guangzhou is the growth rate of RZEP higher than that of ZEPsummer,d. Increasing the PV capacity has the greatest impact on improving the RZEP directly. Beijing and Shanghai have a larger growth rate of ZEPsummer,d, which means that increasing PV generation has a smaller direct impact on improving the RZEP in these two climatic regions. According to the results of the optimization investigation where changes in RZEP were assessed in line with increasing PV capacity, it has been found that an endless increase in PV capacity is not cost-efficient and cannot realize 100% RZEP. For Shanghai and Guangzhou, the determination of PV capacity is recommended to refer to the ZEPsummer,d. The ZEPsummer,d of PVACs can reach 90% with 1.3 times the initial PV capacity in Shanghai and Guangzhou. 90% ZEPsummer,d means that the total daily PV generation is higher than the total daily consumption of air conditioners on most days in summer. With the help of batteries, the PVACs can realize 90% RZEP with a relatively small PV and battery energy storage capacity in summer. From the economic and practical perspectives, the recommended PV capacity for PVACs in Shanghai and Guangzhou are 1.3 times the initial PV capacity. The determination of PV capacity for PVACs is dependent on the winter performance in Beijing since the dominant energy consumption of air conditioners is heating. According to Fig. 14 , the ZEPwinter,h is higher than the ZEPwinter,d. The reason is that the energy mismatching between PV generation and the energy consumption of PVAC is too large in the morning and afternoon. Both the outdoor temperature and solar irradiation are in the morning and afternoon, therefore it is difficult for the total PV generation to cover the large energy consumption of the air conditioners during that time. However, both the outdoor temperature and solar irradiation are high around noon, so the hourly total PV generation is enough to meet the small energy consumption during this period. For the huge differences in energy performance at different times in Beijing, the PV capacity based on the ZEPwinter,d means that large batteries are necessary to realize the real-time zero-energy. The PV capacity determined based on the ZEPwinter,h is more reasonable. With 1.3 times the initial PV capacity, the ZEPwinter,h reaches 60% when the PV capacity increases to 1.3 times of the initial PV capacity while the ZEPsummer,d is close to 100%. Then, the growth rate of ZEPwinter,h increases slowly with the continuous increase in PV capacity. Considering the annual operation of the PVAC system, the determination of the optimized PV capacity needs to consider both the ZEPsummer,d and ZEPwinter,h. Hence, the recommended PV capacity of PVACs in Beijing is 1.3 times the initial PV for annual operation. In summary, the recommended PV capacity of PVACs in the three climatic regions is 1.3 times the initial PV capacity. The RZEP of Guangzhou has the maximum growth rate with the same increase of PV capacity. Moreover, up to 2 PV, the growth of RZEP in Guangzhou is still large. Considering the aspects of economics and practicality, increasing PV capacity with the help of small size batteries is the recommended optimization measure in Guangzhou. For Shanghai, increasing the PV capacity has a smaller impact on RZEP growth, which is most noticeable in the winter when large energy mismatching problems often occur in the morning and afternoon. Hence, a larger battery capacity is the optimal method to improve the RZEP in Shanghai. For Beijing, the RZEP can reach 90% without the help of batteries in summer. There is a larger energy mismatching problem in the winter mornings and afternoons. A large battery should be used to cover the peak energy consumption of air conditioners for heating, which is neither economical nor practical. Passive designs, the use of phase change materials, and cheaper thermal storage devices is the recommended method to improve the annual RZEP in Beijing. 4.5 Economic analysis of PVACs Since the economic analysis of the PVAC systems are similar in different climatic regions, we selected one climatic region to evaluate the economic performance in detail. As an example of economic analysis, the economic performance of PVACs in Guangzhou was evaluated by different economic indicators. The installed PV capacity of the PV system is 14 kW. The payback time of the PVAC system with TCTR is calculated to be only 3.48 years, which is about 2 years shorter than that of the PVAC system without TCTR. Therefore, the economic performance of the PVAC system with considering TCTR is substantial. The above economic analysis indicates that the PVACs considering TCTR is a good solution to realize a high real-time zero energy probability and bring an excellent economic benefit at the same time. 5 Conclusion PVAC systems play an important role in the mission to achieve real-time zero-energy buildings. However, the real-time energy mismatch between PV generation and the PVAC load is a severe problem. To design a more practical and economic PVAC system, a method evaluating the ZEP of PVAC systems with the adoption of the thermal comfort temperature range (TCTR) was proposed. Correspondingly, four new indicators, including zero energy probability (ZEPm,n), real-time zero energy probability (RZEP), complete overcooling probability (COCP), and complete overheating probability (COHP), were used to evaluate the real-time energy match performance of the PVACs. The key conclusions are drawn as follows: 1. The introduction of TCTR can effectively improve the real-time energy matching degree of PVACs and make it closer to actual applications. Compared with the cases of fixed indoor setting temperature, the maximum improvements of RZEP with the adoption of TCTR in Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Beijing were 51.24%, 47.03%, and 86%, respectively. Moreover, when TCTR was considered, more zero-energy points appeared around the time of large cooling load demand. 2. Different from the traditional control strategy of air conditioning, the indoor temperature of PVACs is mainly determined by the real-time PV generation. Only when the indoor temperature conditioned by the PVAC is beyond the thermal comfort temperature range, power is taken from or uploaded to external devices, such as utility grid or energy storage systems. This can make PVACs maximize the PV self-consumption and be self-sufficient, without incurring any additional costs. Correspondingly, the battery capacity required and the electricity taken from the utility grid can be reduced to a large extent, which will bring considerable economic benefits. For the utility grid side, the impacts caused by the unstable PV electricity can be mitigated by reducing the electricity taken from or uploaded to the utility grid. The burden on the utility grid can be decreased to a large degree. With an increase in PV installation capacity, PVACs can reduce their dependence on the grid, which is important for the stable operation of the utility grid in the future. 3. Machine learning models combined with EnergyPlus are an effective and accurate way to predict the real-time indoor temperature conditioned by PVACs under actual operation conditions. They provide a solid foundation for the new control strategy of PVACs with TCTR. Among the six popular ML models, the XGBoost regressor model has the highest prediction accuracy for the real-time indoor temperature. 4. A universal evaluation method for ZEP of PVACs with the adoption of TCTR was proposed. The ultimate purpose is to maximize the real-time PV self-sufficiency and self-consumption of PVAC systems. The proposed evaluation method can help PVAC systems work more efficiently to cope with the situation of ever-increasing PV installation capacity. It can also be applied to other renewable energy driven air conditioning systems to evaluate their real-time zero-energy potential. 5. Different optimization methods were offered for different climatic regions to improve the RZEP of PVACs according to its characteristics. The first method of optimization is to increase the PV capacity because batteries are expensive. Utilizing PV generation with TCTR to achieve real-time ZEP as much as possible is the preference. Based on the optimized PV capacity, additional measures to enhance the RZEP in Shanghai, Beijing, and Guangzhou are introducing energy storage devices, improving building envelope structures, and increasing PV capacity, respectively.

        "dc:description": "The real-time energy matching between building load and PV generation is low in actual applications of photovoltaic direct-driven air conditioners (PVACs). The indoor thermal comfort temperature range (TCTR) can enhance the load flexibility of PVACs to improve the real-time zero energy probability. Therefore, a real-time zero-energy potential evaluation method with the adoption of TCTR for PVACs was proposed. The indoor temperatures are mainly determined by real-time PV generation, which minimizes the power taken from the grid and batteries. The indoor temperature, conditioned by PVACs under varying operating conditions, is predicted using machine learning models at a one-minute time resolution. The real-time energy matching performances of PVACs are evaluated by key indicators, including zero-energy probability, real-time zero-energy probability, complete overcooling rate, and complete overheating rate, for different climatic regions. With a fixed indoor setting temperature in summer, the real-time zero-energy probabilities in Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Beijing are 1.89%, 2.45%, and 2.11%, respectively. While adopting the TCTR with the similar PV capacity, the corresponding values in Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Beijing reach 53.13%, 49.48%, and 87.11%, respectively. In addition, the real-time zero-energy points frequently appear when large cooling demands are needed. Finally, an optimization of PV capacity is conducted. The optimal PV capacity was found to be at the point where seasonal PV generation is 1.3 times the dominant seasonal energy consumption. PVACs with TCTR can utilize the PV generation and load flexibility to the greatest extent and the evaluation method for PVACs is beneficial for designing a more practical and economical system.",
