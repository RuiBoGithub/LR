University of Toronto Department of Civil and Mineral Engineering 35 St. George St. Toronto ON M5S 1A4 Canada Smart home technologies are becoming prevalent in residential buildings. Despite interface and control improvements offered by smart thermostats, previous work has found energy savings from this technology to be variable. Further, little is known about how smart thermostat operation differs from conventional programmable thermostat operation, which has been studied extensively. In this paper, data from 54 smart thermostats installed in two high-rise residential buildings are used to characterize smart thermostat programming and occupant interaction behaviours. Survey data are also used to examine how environmental attitudes and technical abilities influence thermostat usage behaviours. Smart thermostat programming rates were higher than those previously found for conventional programmable thermostats, likely due to improved thermostat interfaces. Further, programmed schedule accuracy was high (88% occupancy during scheduled unoccupied periods). Participants programmed substantial setforwards (cooling season average of 2.8 °C) and setbacks (heating season average of 3.8 °C) to be used when their home is unoccupied. Override behaviours were generally not problematic: most overrides had short durations or were frequently adjusted by users. Strong environmental attitudes and technical skills also appeared to result in more energy-conscious thermostat use behaviours, however, due to the population demographics, specific relationships between energy conservation attitudes and thermostat use behaviours were unclear. An analysis of thermostat schedules and setpoints considering measured occupancy data indicated that participant-programmed schedules achieved significant HVAC load reductions when compared to a scenario in which no schedule was programmed. Further, the use of occupancy-based controls, whether alone or in combination with a schedule, was shown to improve energy savings. Keywords Smart thermostats Residential buildings Occupant behaviour HVAC Connected thermostats Energy management 1 Introduction The adoption rate of smart home technologies, particularly smart thermostats, in residential buildings is growing. Smart thermostats are thermostats which can be controlled remotely through the use of a phone or web application and/or through integration with other \u2018internet-of-things\u2019 devices. Other features, such as reactive- or predictive-occupancy based control, maybe be included in the device, however, these features vary between manufacturers. In 2016, 7.8 million homes in North America had smart thermostats, with this number expected to grow to 43.4 million by 2021 [1]. Smart thermostats allow for programming of temperature setpoint schedules, similar to their conventional, programmable thermostat counterparts (which do not provide online access options and must be programmed through the device itself), and offer new opportunities to implement alternative heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) control strategies, which can reduce energy use from these systems [2\u20134]. However, similar to the limitations found with conventional programmable thermostats [5\u20137], the potential energy savings of smart thermostat technologies are limited by the willingness and ability of users to program accurate thermostat settings and adopt energy-conscious thermostat temperature setpoints. Modern, smart thermostats may increase thermostat programming rates through improved user interfaces over those on conventional programmable thermostats, which have commonly been found to be confusing or inaccessible to users [7\u201317]. However, even if every household programs their thermostat with a setpoint schedule, energy savings may be limited by the temperature setpoints selected by users and how accurately programmed thermostat schedules reflect actual home occupancy and usage patterns. These limitations can, in part, be addressed through the use of alternative HVAC control methods. Occupancy-based control is a common feature in commercially-available smart thermostats [18\u201320] and offers opportunities to reduce the need for accurate programming of thermostat schedules. However, user choice of temperature setpoints for periods in which their home is unoccupied and suite-usage schedule programming may still limit their realized energy conservation. In this paper, survey and thermostat data collected from two high-rise residential buildings in a cold climate are used to characterize occupant programming behaviours for smart thermostats; including temperature setpoints, scheduling, and schedule override use, and their relationship to self-reported environmental attitudes and technical skills. Finally, a preliminary assessment of how thermostat settings and occupant-override behaviours impact energy savings is presented. 2 Background Energy savings performance of programmable thermostats is highly variable and dependent on user settings and behaviours [6,21\u201325]. Conventional, programmable thermostats have a wide range of usability issues which limit initial and continued use of programming features. Users frequently report issues related to confusing programming procedures, interfaces with small fonts or buttons, use of confusing symbols or abbreviations, and difficulty accessing the physical location of the thermostat [7,8,17,21,26,27,9\u201316]. As a result, programming rates are typically low, the use of overrides (e.g., temperature \u201cholds\u201d) is high [21], and energy conservation benefits are limited. Connected, smart thermostat technologies offer interface improvements (i.e., digital interfaces with full text, web portals and/or mobile applications), which likely improve schedule programming rates. Investigation into programming rates of smart thermostats, a relative newcomer in the residential market, has been limited in comparison to research into conventional programmable thermostats, however, initial findings are promising. Miu et al. found that 45% of homes that had previously not set a schedule on their conventional, programmable thermostat started using a programmed schedule after their home\u2019s thermostat was upgraded to a smart model [28]. In a different study, Huchuk, O\u2019Brien, and Sanner found that 60% of smart thermostats were operated on a schedule, either programmed or default [29]. Huchuk, O\u2019Brien, and Sanner, however, did not differentiate between occupant-programmed and thermostat default schedules, the latter of which may not reflect actual home usage schedules and, as a result, may limit realized energy savings. Further, it is unclear from previous work how accurately programmed schedules match actual home occupancy patterns (e.g., proportion of time occupants are home when they say they will be and vice-versa). In addition to improvements to device interfaces, most commercially-available smart thermostat models are equipped with occupancy-based control strategies which aim to reduce HVAC energy use for periods in which homes are unoccupied. Different technologies, including presence sensors and geo-fencing, can be used to detect home occupancy and apply thermostat setpoint changes when the home is unoccupied to reduce the reliance on a programmed schedule. Similar to findings related to conventional, programmable thermostats, the energy benefits of occupancy-based control are inconsistent [2,3,30\u201333]. In part, this variation may be due to differences in thermostat programming amongst occupants, differences in default settings on thermostat models, and differences in how home occupancy is determined. While occupancy-based control strategies can mitigate the impacts of non-existent or inaccurate schedule programming, they may not be appropriate as a stand-alone replacement for accurately programmed schedules, as occupancy-based control strategies typically operate with a significant delay (ecobee, personal communication, July 24, 2020), particularly when implemented using presence sensors. This delay is incorporated into the thermostat control because of the limited accuracy of occupancy detection through the current presence-sensor implementation \u2013 without a delay, the thermostat may frequently falsely identify a home as unoccupied when it is in fact occupied (e.g., if an occupant is stationary or in a different room of the house). The delay between the first unoccupied measurement and the application of a temperature setback can be long. For example, the thermostat model used in this study uses a two-hour delay between the first unoccupied measurement and the application of a temperature setpoint change. As such, to improve realized energy savings, occupancy-based control strategies used in commercially-available products may need to be paired with a programmed schedule which accurately reflects the \u201ctypical\u201d home usage pattern. The use of geo-fencing reduces the need for delays in applying setpoint changes when a home is unoccupied, but comes with its own set of challenges. User privacy concerns, which also exist for presence-sensor implementations, are exacerbated when geo-fencing is used. Further, the use of geo-fencing requires that thermostats are operated \u201conline\u201d while presence-sensors may be operated in online or offline modes. To maximize adoption of occupancy-based control in homes, it is important to offer some variety of implementations, so that users may select the option they feel most comfortable with. This paper addresses the key knowledge gaps related to occupants\u2019 programming and override behaviours outlined above through an analysis of smart thermostat and survey data. Specifically, this paper provides new knowledge in the following areas: 1. Occupants\u2019 temperature setpoints programming and adjustment behaviours in contemporary high-rise residential buildings using smart thermostats (Section 4.1); 2. Occupants\u2019 schedule programming behaviours and the accuracy of programmed \u201cHome\u201d and \u201cAway\u201d periods (Section 4.2); 3. Occupants\u2019 override behaviours (Section 4.3); 4. Consideration of the practical implications of the observations in Section 4, along with identification of challenges and opportunities associated with smart thermostat use (Section 5). Occupants\u2019 schedules, setpoints, and override use behaviours are characterized and compared with actual suite occupancy data and occupants\u2019 self-reported environmental attitudes and technical abilities, followed by an assessment of challenges and opportunities related to improving energy savings from smart thermostats in residential settings. 3 Methodology This work was completed as part of a larger study on the thermal comfort and energy impacts of smart thermostat retrofits in high-rise multi-unit residential buildings (MURBs). Study recruitment, compensation, and survey methods and materials were approved by the University of Toronto Research Ethics Board. In this section, the two studied buildings and participants and data collection methods are outlined. 3.1 Study buildings and participants Two recently constructed high-rise MURBs in Toronto, Canada were recruited to participate in the study. Toronto has a heating-dominated climate, with long, cold heating seasons (typically October through March) and shorter, warm cooling seasons (June through September). As an example, during 2019, Toronto had 3929 heating degree days and 340 cooling degree days [34] . The key characteristics of the study buildings are outlined in Table 1 . In both buildings, each suite is equipped with one or two thermostats which control the in-suite terminal HVAC unit(s) based on the suite air temperature. In both buildings, non-programmable thermostats were initially installed in the suites when they were built \u2013 the majority of which have not been replaced by suite owners or renters. Information on the study was provided to residents of the two buildings through an information session and emails from the building manager, then residents volunteered to participate in the study. In total, 54 participants were recruited for the study and had smart thermostats installed to replace the existing thermostats in their suites. Participants allowed researchers to remotely collect thermostat data and alter thermostat control methods for a one-year monitoring period which began on August 15, 2018 and ended on August 15, 2019. Participants were free to program and adjust thermostat settings at any time, however, in Building A, the availability of heating or cooling through the terminal unit is dependent on central system operation mode (heating or cooling). In Building B, heating and cooling are both available year-round from the terminal unit. 3.2 Survey data collection Data were collected on participants\u2019 attitudes towards energy conservation and self-reported technical ability through a telephone survey at the beginning of the study. Basic demographic information related to participant age and whether or not children lived in the suite were also collected. The relevant survey questions are summarized in Table 2 . Age demographic information collected from participants did not have a fine enough resolution to provide meaningful insights and is not included in further analysis. 85% of participating suites were occupied solely by residents between the ages of 18 and 64. In the other eight suites, children resided in seven of the suites and one suite was occupied by seniors (older than 64). While financial demographic information was not collected in the study, participants can be assumed to be relatively financially affluent: the average household income in the two-block radius surrounding the study building is $107,000 CAD [35] and the average rental price for similar condominium units in the area is between $2,000 and $2,500 CAD monthly [36]. 3.3 Thermostat data collection The smart thermostats used in this study differ from conventional programmable thermostats in the methods in which temperature setpoints and schedules are set. While conventional programmable thermostats typically have occupants directly set heating and/or cooling temperature setpoints for hourly or half-hourly periods, the smart thermostats used in this study rely on two programming components to set temperature setpoint schedules. Users must program \u201ccomfort settings\u201d, which define temperature setpoints, expected occupancy, and other operational parameters for different modes of thermoset operation; as well as a daily schedule (adjustable to half-hourly periods), which defines what comfort setting should be used at what time. The end result, a thermostat temperature setpoint schedule, is the same in both instances, however, the two-stage programming method used by the smart thermostat allows for consideration of occupant comfort preferences and suite usage patterns separately. Thermostat data were used to characterize both thermostat programming and occupant override use. Data were collected on 5-minute intervals for each suite and included suite temperature setpoints, schedules, holds (an occupant-initiated schedule override which changes the temperature setpoint), and occupancy/presence data. Presence is detected by the thermostat using passive infra-red (PIR) motion sensors with a detection range of 6 m and viewing angles of 140° horizontally and 100° vertically as a proxy for direct collection of occupancy data. Analysis completed by the thermostat manufacturer showed that, when compared with ground-truth occupancy data collected through geo-fencing and Wi-Fi data, these motion sensors have low rates of false-positive detections \u2013 when motion is detected by the sensor, there is an approximately 95% probability of actual occupancy in the home (ecobee, personal communication, August 10, 2020). On the other hand, false-negative detections, where no motion is detected by the sensor when the home is occupied, occur more frequently \u2013 the rate of which depends significantly on home sensor density, the duration of time since motion was last detected, and occupant behaviours. In general, the sensor configurations used in most single-family homes (i.e., the use of two sensors) appear to have a false-negative rate of approximately 40%, when a home is considered unoccupied when motion has not been detected for a period of two hours. When more sensors are present in a home (i.e., three to five sensors in a single-family home), the rate of false-negative readings decreases to 35% or less when motion has not been detected for the two hours immediately preceding the measurement, which is likely more representative of the accuracy of the sensors in the residential suites studied in this paper, due to their small floor area and relatively high sensor density. When a home is considered unoccupied after a shorter time period without motion detected, the rate of false-negative readings increases exponentially (e.g., after one-hour of occupancy not being detected by in-home sensors, the false-negative rate is ~85%). While occupancy detection accuracy for PIR configurations consistent with typical residential smart thermostat usage (i.e., one to three PIR sensors placed in a subset of rooms in a building with low occupant-density) has not been previously studied, the detection accuracy information provided by the manufacturer is consistent with the findings of previous work in single-room office spaces. Tiller et al. [37], for example, found that the PIR sensor-measured cumulative occupancy time was between 20% and 80% lower than cumulative occupancy time measured by a human observer. To reduce errors associated with false-negative presence measurements, in this study, suites are only considered to be unoccupied when motion is not detected for a period of at least two hours. Unoccupied periods are deemed to commence at the time no motion is first detected and end when motion is detected again (note that this is unrelated to the two-hour delay used by the thermostat to determine the start of an unoccupied period when occupancy-based control is used). In the study, three different control strategies were tested: 1) standard programmable thermostat control, 2) occupancy-based control through presence detection; and 3) a novel load shifting control strategy. Thermostat control alternated between three-day periods of standard programmable thermostat control and three-day periods of occupancy-based control over the course of the monitoring period. Additionally, the load shifting control strategy was tested for a total of 21 days in the cooling season and six days in the heating season. The analysis in this manuscript deals primarily with occupant-thermostat interactions during the standard, programmable thermostat control mode periods, however, at times, aggregate data from all control strategy periods are considered as indicated in the text. Further, the awareness of participants of the availability of alternative control methods, particularly occupancy-based control through presence detection, may influence how they program schedules and setpoints, which is mentioned where applicable throughout the text. Two distinct time periods were considered in the analysis: cooling season (i.e., data from the months of June, July, August, and September) and heating season (i.e., data from the months of October, November, December, January, February, and March). 4 Results: Thermostat setpoints, schedules, and override behaviours In this section, user comfort settings (Section 4.1), schedules (Section 4.2), and schedule override behaviours (Section 4.3) are characterized along with reported environmental motivations and technical skill levels. 4.1 Setpoints By default, users are provided with three comfort settings when the smart thermostat is installed: 1) a \u201cHome\u201d setting which is intended to be used when the home is occupied (default heating setpoint of 20.5 °C, default cooling setpoint of 25.5 °C); 2) an \u201cAway\u201d setting which is intended to be used when the home is unoccupied (default heating setpoint of 18 °C, default cooling setpoint of 28 °C); and 3) a \u201cSleep\u201d setting which is intended to be used when the home is occupied, but occupants are likely to be sleeping (default heating setpoint of 18.5 °C, default cooling setpoint of 28 °C). While users are free to add more comfort settings as they wish, only two study participants added any additional comfort settings beyond these three default modes. As such, analysis of setpoints and schedules in this work is limited to consideration of the three default comfort settings (Home, Away, Sleep). Table 3 summarizes the observed temperature setpoints and setbacks, which are further discussed in the remainder of this section. Fig. 1 shows the range and frequency of Home temperature setpoints observed in each suite in the cooling and heating seasons. Participants infrequently adjusted their Home temperature setpoint after any initial change from the default temperature setting. This was particularly prevalent in the heating season, during which 66% of participants never changed their Home temperature setpoint (shown by the lack of a box in the box plots in Fig. 1). In both cooling and heating season, when participants did make adjustments to their temperature setpoint, it was likely to be a one-time occurrence or repetitive switching between two temperature setpoints (shown by the boxes with no median line or whiskers on the box plots in Fig. 1). The latter of which indicates a potential misunderstanding of how to use the thermostat. When they occurred, setpoint changes were typically large in magnitude, with participants changing their setpoints by up to 5.5 °C. On average, the difference between participants\u2019 minimum and maximum Home temperature setpoint was 1.4 °C during both cooling and heating seasons (2.0 °C during cooling season and 2.2 °C during heating season, if only participants with at least one setpoint change are considered). Due to the large magnitude of the setpoint changes and the frequency of the repetitive setpoint switching (seven suites adjusted their temperature setpoint over 300 times in the cooling and/or heating season), these setpoint adjustments are unlikely to be reflective of a change in temperature comfort preference. Instead, these changes may be a method used by participants to force their HVAC system \u201coff\u201d, to reduce HVAC runtime during an extended period that the suite is unoccupied (e.g., occupant is on vacation), to adjust for different periods of suite usage, multiple occupants with competing preferences, or to heat/cool their suite more quickly. The latter has been found to be a common misconception by thermostat users in previous research: users incorrectly assume that larger differential between temperature setpoint and suite air temperature results in quicker cooling [5,7,13,38]. It is unclear, however, why participants would choose to use a setpoint change as opposed to a schedule override or thermostat settings change to accomplish these hypothesized objectives (with the exception of multiple occupants with competing preferences). As extreme temperature setpoint values that may have been set by the participant by mistake or to drive a certain system behaviour for a short period of time are shown as outliers in Fig. 1, temporary changes to Home temperature setpoints made in error are not the cause of the large magnitude changes observed in Fig. 1. Of the 34% of participants that only had two different setpoints in the cooling season, 65% made a single setpoint change during the monitoring period while the remaining 35% repeatedly switched between two different setpoints. Similarly, in the heating season, 20% of participants had only two different setpoints, 64% of which only made a single setpoint change. Fig. 2 shows the Home temperature setpoints observed in each 5-minute data interval during cooling and heating season across the study population. Generally, heating season Home temperature setpoints were clustered between 20 °C and 21.5 °C, with an abrupt decrease in observed setpoints below 20 °C. Heating season Home temperature setpoints between 22 °C and 23 °C were less frequent, but not uncommon in the sample. A wider range of Home temperature setpoints was observed during the cooling season, with the majority of Home temperature setpoints falling between 23 °C and 26 °C. Away and Sleep temperature setpoints, which are intended to be used when the suite is unoccupied and when suite occupants are sleeping, respectively, are considered relative to the Home temperature setpoints. From an energy-savings perspective, it is desirable for occupants to \u201csetforward\u201d or increase their temperature setpoint while in Away or Sleep modes in the cooling season and to \u201csetback\u201d or reduce their temperature setpoint during the heating season. In general, study participants demonstrated energy conscious setpoint behaviours through the consistent use of setforwards in cooling season and setbacks in heating season in their Away comfort settings (Fig. 3 ). On average, participants programmed average setforwards of 2.8 °C and average setbacks of 3.8 °C (an increase from the programmed defaults of ± 2.5 °C). Notably, a few participants had Away temperature setpoints which were lower than their Home temperature setpoints in cooling season (n = 7) and vice-versa in heating season (n = 2). Of these participants, only one had a schedule at any point during the monitoring period that utilized the Away temperature setpoint, which means that these \u201cenergy inefficient\u201d Away temperature setpoints did not actually impact suite-HVAC energy use in the majority of cases. Less aggressive setforwards and setbacks were observed for the Sleep temperature setpoints relative to participants\u2019 Home temperature setpoints and the proportion of people who decreased their temperature setpoint during cooling season and increased their temperature setpoint during heating season was higher than what was observed for participant\u2019s Away setpoints (Fig. 4 ). Participants\u2019 programmed Sleep setforwards in the cooling season were negligible on average across the study population, as some participants did not use setforwards, but rather setbacks during sleep periods (i.e., to make their suite cooler while they slept). In the heating season, participant Sleep setbacks averaged 1.3 °C, less than half of the average setback observed for Away periods. The lower magnitude of temperature setforwards and setbacks is likely comfort-driven, as the Sleep temperature setpoint is intended to be used when the suite is occupied. Welch\u2019s two-sample t-test with a 70% confidence interval was used to test if any significant relationships existed between participants\u2019 self-reported environmental attitudes or technical skill levels and their programmed setforwards or setbacks. Overall, participants\u2019 willingness to conserve energy did not appear to influence the magnitude of their programmed setforwards or setbacks, when a 70% confidence interval was applied. Similarly, participants\u2019 attitudes on to what degree individuals are responsible for setting energy conservation goals did not appear to influence the programmed setforwards and setbacks, with two exceptions. Table 4 shows the summary statistics relating participants\u2019 Away period setforwards/setbacks to the surveyed data on environmental attitudes and technical skill levels. In the cooling season, participants who identified with the statement \u201cPeople should set their own targets for energy saving\u201d as a group had deeper Away period setforwards (mean setforward = 3.6 °C, n = 5) as compared to their counterparts who believed that \u201cPeople should try to save energy whenever possible\u201d (mean setforward 2.4 °C, n = 31). In the heating season, participants who identified with the statement \u201cPeople should set their own targets for energy saving\u201d did not have a statistically significant different mean setback as compared to participants who believed \u201cPeople should try to save energy whenever possible\u201d. However, when the mean setback of this group was compared with participants who identified with the statement \u201cPeople should monitor their own energy use\u201d (mean setback = 3.7 °C, n = 16), participants who believed people should set their own energy targets used less-deep setbacks comparatively (mean setback = 3.2 °C, n = 5), which is somewhat counter-intuitive. Notably, the number of participants who indicated that people should set their own energy targets was quite low (n = 5), which may limit the significance of these observed relationships. Self-reported levels of technical skill and environmental \u201cfriendliness\u201d did not appear to influence the magnitude of participants\u2019 programmed setforwards or setbacks, however, representation of participants who reported being technically unsavvy or non-environmentally friendly were low. As participants self-selected to participate in the study, the study population is likely skewed towards participants that are generally more technically savvy and environmentally conscious compared to the general population. Notably, very few participants reported being unwilling to change their behaviour to conserve energy (n = 1), believing that energy conservation is solely the responsibility of governments (and not individuals) (n = 4), or reporting being technically unsavvy (n = 3). Based on the limited breadth of environmental attitudes or technical skill present in the study population, it is difficult to draw any conclusions on the influence of these variables at the lower end of the surveyed spectrums (e.g., low environmental consciousness, low technical skill, etc.). 4.2 Schedules A default schedule is set on the study thermostat out of the box, in which the user is assumed to be home between the hours of 06:30 and 23:30 and asleep between the hours of 23:30 and 06:30. The majority of participants programmed a new schedule or modified the default schedule, however 17% of participants (n = 9) did not make any changes to the default schedule over the one-year monitoring period. This proportion of essentially \u201cunprogrammed\u201d smart thermostats is significantly lower than the findings of previous work on conventional programmable thermostats, which has reported that up to 70% of these thermostats remain unprogrammed [39]. The percentage of thermostats scheduled in Sleep, Away and Home modes for each 30-minute period on weekdays and weekends, respectively, are shown in Fig. 5 . As expected, the majority of participants who had an Away schedule set had it programmed to occur between 8:00 and 18:00 during the weekdays, however, unexpectedly, this trend was present to a lesser degree on weekends as well. Two participants had Sleep periods programmed for the daytime hours and, on further investigation, this did not appear to be a mistake in programming but rather reflective of alternative working hours (e.g., overnight work) due to the programming of Away and Home periods during evening hours. Arguably more significant than the actual timing of scheduled Home, Away, and Sleep periods is how accurately this programming reflects actual suite usage conditions. Fig. 6 shows the percent of time each suite was actually occupied during scheduled Home periods, for weekdays. A similar figure for the weekend periods is included for reference in the Supplementary Material document (Supplementary Material Fig. 1). As discussed in Section 3.3, for a period to be considered unoccupied, no motion must be detected for at least two hours. This may result in the observed proportion of time suites are unoccupied when scheduled to be occupied being slightly lower than the actual values, as periods in which suites are unoccupied for less than two hours will not be captured in the calculations. Note that where the figure is blank (e.g., a square is white), the thermostat was scheduled to be in an Away or Sleep state. Most suites exhibited high schedule conformance to actual occupied periods. On average, across the study population, suites were detected to be unoccupied 12% of the time during scheduled occupied periods on weekdays and 11% of the time on weekends. These findings may be slightly lower than the actual values due to the inaccuracies of introduced by the presence sensors. Conversely, as shown in Fig. 7 , for periods when suites were scheduled to be unoccupied, schedule conformance was lower: On average, across the study population, suites were occupied during scheduled unoccupied periods 21% of the time on weekdays and 37% of the time on weekends. Note that a smaller subset of suites is shown in Fig. 7, as only 44% of suites included unoccupied periods in their thermostat schedules. Again, a similar figure for the weekend periods is included for reference in the Supplementary Material document (Supplementary Material Fig. 2). In general, the accuracy of schedule-setting was not observed to be strongly correlated to any of the environmental attitudes or technical savviness parameters included in this study. This may be a result of a subset occupants not being able to accurately anticipate an occupancy schedule for their suite or a belief that schedule setting is not important in achieving energy conservation goals when occupancy-based control is used. 4.3 Occupant-initiated program overrides In this section, the frequency of override use in baseline smart thermostat operation is considered along with the duration and adjustment frequencies (e.g., how often occupants change the temperature or end time of a hold) for occupant-initiated overrides. Note that while the analysis of frequency of override use is limited to the baseline operation mode, the analysis of override durations and adjustment frequencies considers data from all tested control strategies as overrides frequently spanned multiple days and, as a result, multiple tested control strategies. 4.3.1 Frequency of override use When the thermostats were operated in baseline operation mode, 33% of suites were engaged in an override at any given time. This is consistent with the findings of Huchuk, O\u2019Brien, and Sanner, who found 30% − 35% of the over 23,000 thermostats examined in their work were engaged in a hold at any given time [29]. The dataset used by Huchuk, O\u2019Brien and Sanner was an open dataset from the same thermostat manufacturer used in this study and included data from thermostats predominately located in North America for users who had opted in to the thermostat manufacturer\u2019s data sharing program. It is worth noting Huchuk, O\u2019Brien, and Sanner do not differentiate between the operational characteristics of thermostats operating in a standard, programmable thermostat mode or occupancy-based control and, as a result, their findings represent the aggregate override behaviour for both modes. This override behaviour is also consistent with the proportion of conventional, programmable thermostats found to be engaged in a hold (approximately one-third) by Pritoni et al., determined through photos showing the current state of thermostat operation submitted by 30 study participants [5]. This indicates that differences between the interfaces of the smart thermostat model used in this study and conventional programmable thermostats do not impact how often occupants use overrides in a significant way. While the proportion of thermostats engaged in an override at any given time has been a popular metric in previous studies due to limitations on data collection from conventional, programmable thermostats, the proportion of time individual suites spend in override is a more useful for understanding individuals\u2019 behaviours. Fig. 8 shows the proportion of time suites spent engaged in an override during standard programmable thermostat operation in the cooling and heating season. Participants used overrides on average 30% of the time in the cooling season (median = 14%) and 31% of the time during the heating season (median = 19%). When override use for individual hourly periods was considered, only slight variation was observed for the proportion of time each suite spent in a hold based on the time of day (with hourly averages between 31% and 36%). Override use was inconsistent amongst participants and varied significantly - some occupants never used overrides, whereas others used them 100% of the time. Again, these findings are consistent with those of Huchuk, O\u2019Brien, and Sanner, who found similar distributions of override use in their dataset [29]. Again, Welch\u2019s two-sample t-test with a 70% confidence interval was used to determine if any statistically significant difference existed between the average duration between override adjustments for participants with different environmental attitudes and technical skill levels. Similar to temperature setpoints, self-reported technical skill level was not observed to be correlated to the proportion of time participants had their thermostats engaged in an override (p = .83). Again, as the representation at the low end of the technical skill spectrum was very small, it is not possible to establish trends for people who identify as moderately or very unsavvy. The degree to which participants perceived themselves as environmentally friendly appeared to be related to their frequency of override use and was statistically significant (p = .04). Participants who identified as \u201cvery environmentally friendly\u201d used overrides less frequently than participants who identified as only \u201cmoderately environmentally friendly\u201d (Fig. 9 ). Note that no participants identified as \u201cnot environmentally friendly at all,\u201d although reporting from this group may be artificially low due as participants may be worried that this response will be perceived unfavourably. Participants who were willing to pay more for sustainably produced energy had a slightly higher median proportion of time spent in an override as compared to participants who were willing to conserve energy only if they received a financial benefit (Fig. 9), however this difference was not statistically significant when a 70% confidence interval was concerned (p = .4). The influence of financial benefits of conservation may be lower in the study population as compared to the general public as participants\u2019 HVAC energy use is only tied to their energy costs loosely due to the cost-sharing structure of the condominium buildings. While participants do pay directly for the electricity consumed by their fan coil or heat pump through utility company submetering, central plant energy use costs are divided amongst building residents through monthly maintenance fees based solely on suite floor area and not actual HVAC use energy. Participants who believed that it is the government\u2019s responsibility, and not individuals\u2019, to save energy through better regulations were observed to spend less time in an override than all other groups (p = .03), which is counter-intuitive, however, the significance of this finding may be reduced to the small number of participants who reported this belief (n = 5). Huchuk, O\u2019Brien, and Sanner classified users as \u201cfrequent holders\u201d (users engaged in an active override 85% of the time or more) and \u201cinfrequent holders\u201d (users engaged in an active override less than 25% of the time), to differentiate between the override initialization and adjustment behaviours of the two groups (2020). The proportion of participants who were classified as frequent holders was lower in this study (6.8%) than in the open dataset used by Huchuk, O\u2019Brien and Sanner (12%), however this may be a result of the smaller sample size available in this study or potentially differences in demographics or technical skill levels of the thermostat users. Similarly, the proportion of participants classified as infrequent holders was lower in this study (49%) than what was found by Huchuk, O\u2019Brien and Sanner (55%) by a small amount. As the number of study participants that fit into the frequent holder category is small, it is not possible to draw conclusions on how the behaviours and attitudes of this group differs from those of the general study population, however some high-level information on override durations and frequency of adjustment is noted based on these classifications. 4.3.2 Duration of override use Overall, when participants used overrides, the override remained active for a median duration of 1.6 days (average duration of 3.2 days, which includes one participant who used a single override for 167 days). Frequent holders, defined as users engaged in a hold 85% of the time or more, generally had a longer average duration of override than the study population (median: 6.9 days, average: 4.8 days), while infrequent holders generally had a shorter average duration of override (median: 0.8 days, average: 1.7 days). Long duration overrides are not necessarily an energy inefficient in themselves\u2013 particularly if overrides are initiated or adjusted frequently to adjust temperature setpoints which reflect the actual occupancy and usage of the suite. Instead, the average duration between when an override was initiated and when the override ended; between when an override was initiated and subsequently adjusted; or between two override adjustments is a more meaningful metric, which considers the frequency of setpoint changes made by the user. For the overall study population, adjustments to overrides (when in use) were made on average every 1.0 days (median 0.35 days \u2013 i.e., just over 8 h). The frequent holder population made adjustments less frequently with an average 1.9 days duration between adjustments (median 2.7 days). Infrequent holders made adjustments an average of every 0.5 days when an override was active (median 0.14 days \u2013 i.e., 3.4 h). While 85% of the time, the duration between adjustments was less than 24 h, the longest 15% of periods between adjustments significantly increased the overall average. As shown in Fig. 10 , the durations between adjustments were typically two hours or less, which is generally a reasonable period for a single temperature setpoint to be in use. Without knowledge of the reason that an override was initiated or adjusted, it is not possible to determine if individual overrides observed in this study were reasonable in duration, however, on aggregate, the override-usage behaviours observed in the study population do not appear to be problematic, based on the infrequent use of overrides and short periods of time between override adjustments. Currently, the default setting for the thermostat used in this study is for an override to remain active indefinitely once set, however, users may adjust this setting such that overrides remain active by default for two hours, four hours, until the next scheduled period, or specify to be asked to set the duration each time. Only 30% of study participants adjusted this setting such that overrides did not remain active indefinitely and, on aggregate, this group had significantly lower average durations of overrides (19 h versus 190 h) and lower average periods of time between override adjustments (5 h versus 67 h) as compared to those participants who had a default setting for overrides to remain active indefinitely. Fig. 11 shows the average duration between override adjustments for different reported environmental and conservation attitudes and technical skill levels. Again, participants\u2019 beliefs regarding to what degree individuals are responsible for energy conservation appeared to have a counter-intuitive effect on the average duration between override adjustments. Participants who believed it is the government\u2019s responsibility to work to achieve energy savings, demonstrated more energy-conscious behaviour than their peers who identified with statements 2 or 3 (see Fig. 11) through adjusting overrides more frequently (p = .02). Participants who believed that individuals should set their own targets for energy savings, on the other hand, demonstrated on average longer durations between override adjustments than their peers who identified with statements 2 or 3 (p = .28), Again, the number of individuals in both these groups are low (n = 5), which limits the significance of these findings. Participants who self-identified as very environmentally friendly demonstrated lower average durations between override adjustments as compared to their peers who identified as only moderately environmentally friendly (p = .04). 4.4 Summary of findings In Section 4, we observed: \u2022 The majority of participants did not make Home temperature setpoint adjustments over the course of the heating or cooling seasons, however, a small proportion of participants made a large number of changes (e.g., some participants made over 400 temperature setpoint changes during the heating or cooling seasons) (Section 4.1); \u2022 Participants typically programmed significant temperature setbacks/setforwards during Away periods (heating season: −3.8 °C, cooling season: +2.8 °C) and smaller temperature setbacks/setforwards during Sleep periods (heating season: −0°C, cooling season: +1.8 °C) (Section 4.1); \u2022 83% of participants programmed a schedule on their thermostat. The Home periods included in these schedules, in general, accurately reflected actual suite occupancy (Section 4.2); \u2022 On average, occupant-initiated overrides were in use ~ 30% of the time, which a mean duration of 3.2 days (median = 1.6 days) (Section 4.3); \u2022 Occupants\u2019 technological ability and environmental attitudes may influence some aspects of their thermostat-use behaviours (Sections 4.1-4.3) 5 Programming and smart control opportunities and challenges Based on the programming and override use habits detailed in the previous sections, some key opportunities and challenges to improving programmable thermostat operation and enabling energy savings from residential smart control can be identified. These are broadly summarized into four categories: scheduling, override use, environmental attitudes, and user technical ability. 5.1 Scheduling Based on the assessment of rates of schedule programming in the study population, the improvements in interface usability provided by smart thermostats over conventional programmable thermostats appear to mitigate one of the largest barriers to their success in achieving energy savings: getting users to program their thermostat schedules. However, despite relatively high scheduling accuracy amongst the study participants, there may be opportunities to increase energy savings through the use of occupancy-based control. To quantify the impact of schedule programming and scheduling inaccuracies on energy savings and provide an initial assessment of improvements to energy savings from occupancy-based control the concept of avoidable demand is used. Avoidable demand, in units of degree-hours, is calculated using Equation 1 and represents the cumulative number of hours and depth of temperature setbacks that do not occur during periods in which a home is detected as unoccupied, but the thermostat program is scheduled as occupied and not in a Sleep period. (1) A v o i d a b l e D e m a n d = ∑ i ( 1 - occ i ) ( T home - T away ) where i is the hourly interval, occ i is the occupancy state of the suite during half-hour period I, based on the pre-processed PIR data (1 if occupancy is detected at any point during the period, 0 otherwise), T home is the suite Home temperature setpoint in degrees Celsius, and T away is the suite Away temperature setpoint in degrees Celsius. This metric allows for quantification of the impact of schedule inaccuracies separate from housing type and HVAC set-up as scheduling inaccuracies are driven by thermostat users, while absolute energy impacts and HVAC operational changes will vary significantly between buildings. Note that the occupancy-data used in the calculation does not represent the ground-truth occupancy of the suite, given the errors associated with occupancy-data collected from PIR sensors. As discussed in Section 3.3, to mitigate the high-likelihood of false-negatives in the PIR data, data were pre-processed and suites were only considered to be unoccupied when motion was not detected for a period of at least two hours. This pre-processing may result in a lower calculated avoidable demand than actual values, as unoccupied periods which last less than two hours will not be captured. Further, the pre-processed occupancy data used in the calculation still has a significantly high rate of false-negatives. This inaccuracy in detection will result in slightly higher calculated avoidable demands as, at times, a suite may be detected to be unoccupied when it is actually occupied. The accuracy of Home period scheduling across the study population was high (~88% occupancy during scheduled occupied periods), which indicates that interventions that make schedule programming easy and accessible (e.g., the improved interfaces available in smart thermostats) are likely sufficient to achieve the majority of potential energy savings from programmable thermostats (conventional or smart). Scheduling programming rates and accuracy should be investigated on a larger, more diverse sample of thermostat users with more accurate presence detection methods to validate this finding. To understand the extent to which the use of user-defined schedules can reduce the avoidable demand in homes, the change between the avoidable demand in a scenario in which no schedule is used is applied and the avoidable demand in the as-scheduled scenario is considered (Fig. 12 ). The average daily avoidable demand per suite in the scenario in which no schedule was use was 11.6 °C·h in the cooling season and 16.0 °C·h in the heating season. In the as-scheduled scenario, avoidable demand was decreased, but remained relatively high due to inaccuracies in Home period scheduling (34% reduction in cooling season, 32% reduction in heating season over the no schedule scenario). Occupancy-based thermostat control is one option to further reduce avoidable demand, either on its own or in combination with a user-defined schedule, however, presence sensing inaccuracies and the long delays used in occupancy-based control implementations limit energy savings opportunities. The impacts of occupancy-based control on avoidable demand when different delays are used (2 h, 1.5 h, 1 h, and 0.5 h) are shown in Fig. 12. Occupancy-based control resulted in significant reductions in avoidable space conditioning demand due to scheduling inaccuracy even when a two-hour delay was considered (with no schedule: 75% in the cooling season and 77% in the heating season; in combination with the as-scheduled scenario: 66% in the cooling season and 70% in the heating season). Reducing the delay to a one-hour or a one-half-hour period increased the reduction in avoidable demand, but not with a magnitude comparable to the reductions achieved from going from the no schedule or as-scheduled scenario to occupancy-based control. Further, using the current PIR sensing capabilities, it is likely that reducing the delay associated with occupancy-based control will increase how often thermostat employs an Away period setpoint when a home is actually occupied. This increases the risk that occupants will experience thermal discomfort due to occupancy-based control and may reduce the rate of control strategy adoption. As such, false-negatives in occupancy data and the associated potential thermal comfort impacts of reduced delays in occupancy-based control must be considered prior to changes to commercially-available thermostat products. In the absence of significant occupancy-sensing accuracy improvements (either through the use of geo-fencing, deployment of additional PIR sensors, or other technologies), it is unlikely that using a delay of less than two-hours in occupancy control will be feasible. Based on this assessment, it is unlikely that the delay associated with occupancy-based control is a significant factor in the variation in energy savings performance observed in previous work [2,3,30\u201333], in particular the variation in energy savings between different thermostat models observed by Lieb and Dimetrosky [30]. Instead, manufacturer default schedules, setbacks/setforwards, and override behaviours (discussed further in Section 5.2) as well as sensor location and density and variation in study population demographics and behaviours are more likely key contributors to the observed differences in performance. Further investigation into the impacts of manufacturer defaults on avoidable demand and energy savings would be beneficial to elicit concrete suggestions on improvements to thermostat defaults which can improve energy savings. 5.2 Overrides In aggregate, the override usage in the study population was infrequent and, when overrides were used, adjustments were made frequently, however, there was a subset of the population who frequently initiated overrides which were used for long durations without regular adjustments. Changing the default behaviour of the thermostat with respect to override durations may be beneficial in reducing this behaviour. In Section 4.3.2, it was observed that participants who adjusted their thermostat settings from the default configuration in which an override remains active indefinitely to one in which overrides remain active for a limited period of time (two hours, four hours, until the next scheduled period) or specifying to be asked to set the duration each time had significantly lower average durations of overrides as well as lower average periods of time between override adjustments. It would be prudent for thermostat manufacturers to change this setting such that overrides end after a certain period of time by default so that users who are \u201cfrequent holders\u201d are prompted to re-consider their temperature setpoints more frequently. 5.3 Environmental attitudes A strong correlation between participants\u2019 self-reported degree of \u201cenvironmental friendliness\u201d and energy-conscious thermostat operation behaviors was found in the study population. However, due to the demographics of the study population, it was not possible to establish clear relationships between thermostat behaviours and more specific environmental attitudes surrounding financial factors (e.g., willingness to conserve if a financial benefit is provided versus willingness to conserve without financial benefit or with increased cost) or the degree to which individuals (versus governments). Future research should investigate the influence of environmental and energy conservation attitudes on thermostat behaviours for a more diverse population, in particular one which has representation at the lower end of the \u201cenvironmental friendliness\u201d and financial affluence spectrums, to more clearly establish a relationship between these factors and thermostat use behaviours. Once a relationship between environmental attitudes and energy conservation motivators and thermostat-behaviours is more clearly established, there may be an opportunity to improve energy savings through adapting thermostat default settings or automated prompts and suggestions based on individuals\u2019 environmental attitudes. 5.4 Technological ability While the study included very few participants who noted very low technical abilities, higher levels of technical abilities still appeared to result in more energy-conscious thermostat operation behaviours. It is assumed that, in populations in which more individuals report very low technological abilities, this relationship will be more pronounced. While smart thermostat interfaces generally provide significant improvements over conventional programmable thermostats, this improvement may not be substantial enough to accommodate users with lower degrees of technical ability. Further research into the usability of smart thermostat interfaces, which are very different from the conventional programmable thermostat interfaces researched previously, is needed to better understand how these interfaces influence behaviour amongst different groups. 6 Conclusions Smart thermostats are becoming prevalent in residential buildings; however, occupants\u2019 usage of these devices is not well understood compared to conventional programmable thermostats. Survey and thermostat data from 54 suites were used to characterize smart thermostat programming and usage behaviours and self-reported environmental values and technical skill levels. Based on this characterization, several opportunities and challenges to reducing energy use through the use of smart thermostats were identified: \u2022 Schedule programming rates were significantly higher than those associated with conventional programmable thermostats and scheduling accuracy was relatively high; \u2022 Occupancy-based control can provide energy savings, even when accurate schedules are programmed by occupants; \u2022 Delays between the first \u201cunoccupied\u201d measurement and the application of a temperature setback during occupancy-based control did not significantly reduce energy savings; \u2022 Differences in default thermostat settings likely contribute to the variation in energy savings observed for different smart thermostat models in previous works; \u2022 Adjusting default thermostat settings, in particular, default schedules and default override behaviours is recommended to promote energy-conscious thermostat usage behaviours.

        "dc:description": "Smart home technologies are becoming prevalent in residential buildings. Despite interface and control improvements offered by smart thermostats, previous work has found energy savings from this technology to be variable. Further, little is known about how smart thermostat operation differs from conventional programmable thermostat operation, which has been studied extensively. In this paper, data from 54 smart thermostats installed in two high-rise residential buildings are used to characterize smart thermostat programming and occupant interaction behaviours. Survey data are also used to examine how environmental attitudes and technical abilities influence thermostat usage behaviours. Smart thermostat programming rates were higher than those previously found for conventional programmable thermostats, likely due to improved thermostat interfaces. Further, programmed schedule accuracy was high (88% occupancy during scheduled unoccupied periods). Participants programmed substantial setforwards (cooling season average of 2.8 °C) and setbacks (heating season average of 3.8 °C) to be used when their home is unoccupied. Override behaviours were generally not problematic: most overrides had short durations or were frequently adjusted by users. Strong environmental attitudes and technical skills also appeared to result in more energy-conscious thermostat use behaviours, however, due to the population demographics, specific relationships between energy conservation attitudes and thermostat use behaviours were unclear. An analysis of thermostat schedules and setpoints considering measured occupancy data indicated that participant-programmed schedules achieved significant HVAC load reductions when compared to a scenario in which no schedule was programmed. Further, the use of occupancy-based controls, whether alone or in combination with a schedule, was shown to improve energy savings.",
