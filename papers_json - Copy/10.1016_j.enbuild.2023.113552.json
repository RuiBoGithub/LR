Personal environmental control (PEC) is an energy-saving approach that empowers occupants with the freedom to regulate the indoor thermal environment, ensuring comfort while conserving energy by conditioning only the occupied space based on individual preferences. However, necessary information to support the practical application of PEC is still missing. Specifically, how the degree of freedom given to occupants changes the building energy efficiency, occupant thermal comfort, and productivity has not yet been investigated systematically. This research (i) investigates the application of PEC in existing thermal systems; (ii) examines the effects of PEC on the aforementioned three criteria for assessing the performance of thermal systems; and (iii) suggests an optimized thermal system incorporating the concept of PEC for a better performance of thermal systems. Primary data was collected by experimentation and observation among 21 participants under four different conditions in a field study in Hong Kong. Repeated measures ANOVA was applied in analyzing the thermal ratings, the energy consumption, and the productivity of participants. The outcome of this study shows that a higher PEC can only lead to marginal improvement of thermal comfort, but the building energy efficiency drops when they set the thermostat temperature themselves under a condition that they are given full control. No clear relationship is found in this study between the PEC and occupant productivity. As a pilot study to compare the performance of thermal systems under different PEC designs, this study contributes to the research field into a practical energy-efficient design of thermal systems by enhancing the occupants\u2019 personal control of the thermal environment.

Under this circumstance, many technological advancements as well as research and development (R&D) have been made in the field, including adapting thermal control strategy subjective to the system [4], increasing qualities of air movement [5,6], applying energy simulation tools (e.g. Energy Plus), using localized cooling or heating methods [7], and pushing other technological innovations. However, it is argued that purely architectural solutions are necessary but not sufficient to achieve climate change mitigation targets, as the end-users, or the occupants, always use and \u201cmisuse\u201d the building systems [8]. The concept that buildings should put more emphasis on how to \u201clead\u201d the users to save energy is raised rather than \u201cdesign a sustainable building\u201d solely. Personal environmental control (PEC) is one of the trials to link the thermal system and the occupants\u2019 thermal behaviors together [9\u201313]. Typically, PEC is defined as the measure of control power exerted by occupants over thermal systems. By using the existing building HVAC system or additional Personal Comfort Systems (PCS), PEC represents the degree of freedom individuals possess to tailor their immediate environment to their preferences [14]. For instance, a desk fan of a higher PEC level generally affords users a wider array of options to accommodate their needs, including various levels of wind speeds, adjustable wind direction, and rotation. To understand the impacts of PEC, Paciuk [15] subcategorized the control power that PEC provides into \u201cavailable control,\u201d \u201cexercised control,\u201d and \u201cperceived control,\u201d within which, perceived personal control (PPC) was found to have the strongest relationship with occupants\u2019 thermal comfort. PPC is defined as the combination of occupants\u2019 knowledge about available controls in the environment and their perceived effectiveness of environmental manipulations. It has been proven to be significant in judging one\u2019s satisfaction, as people are likely to fall into a vicious cycle when they do not feel they have the power to change the situation [11]. When applied in thermal environmental control, consistently, the thermal comfort range of an occupant is found to be widened when they are provided higher PPC [16\u201318], which means that higher PPC will make occupants tend to feel more thermally comfortable. This impact is regarded as a combined effect of physical and psychological thermal factors. In other words, the positive thermal comfort perception happening when adaptive opportunities are given can be stemmed from two approaches, physically they could enjoy a thermal environment that suits their thermal preferences, or psychologically because of a rise in PPC. Luo et al. [19] examined the independent influences through the two approaches with a conclusion that the improvement is mainly due to the psychological influence. However, a higher level of PEC does not simply mean that more control opportunities are wanted. As suggested by Hellwig [11], an enormous variety of control alternatives may make the occupant confused and consequently lead to an unsatisfactory thermal condition. There is yet a well-recognized indicator that can statistically measure \u201cthe level of control,\u201d making the comparison of PEC between buildings difficult [20]. The current literature focuses more on examining whether PCS devices could improve the thermal comfort, or comparing between the effects that different PCS devices make [21\u201325], but few studies are available on how much freedom should be given to the occupants, and whether there should be an upper limit in the degree of control that works to improve the performance of the thermal system based on case studies analysis. For instance, Tang et al. [23] compared the thermal comfort improvement and the energy consumption of six PCS widely applied in China in field experiments, and proved that people usually have different preferences of PCS possibly due to the different design of PCSs. This difference could be due to the different levels of PEC, although not discussed in the study. Zhang et al. [22] found that occupants tend to have higher acceptability when the seat cushion is adjustable in contrast to when it is not adjustable. It could be regarded as one of the results supporting that a higher PEC generally led to higher comfort, but no discussion is made in the energy consumption with and without control and whether more control is desired. Rissetto et al. [13], however, identified no influences of personal control in standing position on thermal perception when using fan, and only slight increase in thermal perception, preference and acceptability with personally controllable wind speed. Additionally, higher PEC may also lead to some problems due to the unpredictability of their behaviors. For example, giving too much control to the occupants/users may lead architects or thermal system designers to lose their control to regulate the building/thermal system operation. If users do not operate the thermal system properly, both the thermal comfort and the energy efficiency could be negatively affected [26], such as overcooling the building which requires extra heating at the personal level [27]. On the other hand, it has been proven in [28] and [29] that noticeable positive relationship is identified between PPC and thermal comfort, but surprisingly, no significance relationship is found between PPC and PEC [28]. A latest study discussing the influences of PEC in personal heating devices on trains suggests, however, that the effect of personal control is largely due to the ability to set the temperature correctly and less due to pure psychological factors [12,30]. There is so far limited discussion on the relationship between PPC, PEC, and their impacts on the performance of thermal system. This study aims to fill this research gap by statistically examining the relationship between PEC and PPC, and their impacts on the performance of thermal system both at the systems\u2019 level (i.e., energy consumption) and the occupants\u2019 level (i.e., thermal comfort and productivity). Research questions that are expected to be answered by this study includes: \u2022 How is the PEC of thermal environment exercised in current thermal systems? \u2022 How would the balance of control between a building and occupants influence the performance of thermal system? (a) How would energy efficiency be affected by the degree of PEC? (b) How would the occupants\u2019 thermal comfort be affected by the degree of PEC? (c) How would the occupants\u2019 productivity be affected by the degree of PEC? \u2022 How should the balance of control between the building system and occupants be maintained? 2 Personal control in thermal systems 2.1 Level of personal control There is yet a well-recognized indicator that can quantitatively or statistically measure \u201cthe level of control,\u201d making the comparison of PEC between buildings difficult [20]. Nonetheless, a few previous studies were able to provide qualitative categorization that may help understand different levels of PEC. Ackerly et al. [20] reviewed and clarified some of the most common distinctions between different control opportunities as a way to describe the PEC given in the thermal system in buildings (Fig. 1 ). 2.2 Personal environmental control in thermal systems The primary goal of thermal system is to create a comfortable environment for occupants. However, survey results indicate that only a mere 11% of buildings were able to achieve the target of attaining over 80% satisfaction among occupants [31]. This is particularly evident in buildings where numerous occupants usually share a similar thermal environment that may fail to meet individual thermal preferences, like office buildings. To tackle this issue, higher PEC is proposed to be permitted through the implementation of personal comfort systems (PCS). The idea is to condition only the occupied space based on the user\u2019s preferences, thereby minimizing the impact on the thermal environment or the comfort of other occupants [27,32,33]. Many previous studies proposed various PCS devices according to their application fields, including dedicated equipment such as localized airflow systems [34], radiant cooling table [35], and bed-based task air conditioning system [36], or using portable or wearable equipment such as portable desk fans [14], chair systems [37,38], or thermal accessories [39]. Review of the recently tested PCS can be found in [21,27,40,41]. Field studies have proved the practicality of PCS in enhancing thermal comfort while reducing energy consumption. For example, Luo et. al [42] observed energy savings of 500\u20131000 W per occupant while maintaining the same level of comfort compared to traditional HVAC systems. Zhang et. al [43] introduced the concept of \u2018corrective power\u2019 as a metric to assess the effectiveness of PCS in providing comfort and concluded that 1 to 6 K corrective power could be saved through the implementation of cooling PCS. However, as PCS always try to create a non-uniform environment [44,45], the temperature gradient should be designed carefully to avoid local thermal discomfort such as radiant asymmetry [26,45], which requires case-by-case inspections. This concern may limit possible mass-scale applications, especially for unportable PCS systems. The relationship between PEC and the performance of thermal systems where PCS is allowed, is summarized in Fig. 2 . When occupants are permitted to directly operate the thermal system through PCS, the level of PEC typically increases. This heightened control leads to a psychological improvement in thermal comfort in addition to the physical and personal effects. Energy-saving can be achieved by providing heating or cooling only as needed and the occupant\u2019s productivity can also be improved due to better thermal comfort. It is also worth noting, however, that when occupants have more PCS options, they may be distracted from their tasks, which makes the relationship between user control and productivity more complex. Distraction here refers to the effect that controlling the thermal environment would have on the occupants, distracting them from the task they are doing. This effect is considered as another factor other than the thermal discomfort that could possibly lower the occupant\u2019s productivity. Apart from allowing higher levels of PEC by implementing PCS, recent studies proposed an alternative approach to balance the occupants comfort and energy consumption by decreasing PEC in thermal systems, particularly central thermal control systems that manage and regulate the thermal environment of an entire room or building as a whole [46,47]. In this approach, thermal systems optimize energy consumption with a goal to achieve a state of balance that ensures lower energy usage without compromising thermal comfort. Various actions can be included, such as increasing the setpoint temperature, reducing humidity levels, or enhancing air movement, but it is the thermal control systems that takes the action instead of the occupants [48\u201353]. These actions taken by central thermal control systems to attain this optimized state may result in a higher degree of \u201ccontrol power\u201d over occupants, as the system endeavours to maintain what it deems as an \u201coptimal thermal environment.\u201d For instance, in some central thermal control systems, occupants may not have the ability to open windows to manage and control the thermal environment of their space freely. Instead, their adaptive opportunities may be limited, typically allowing only the option to turn the thermal system on or off. But in reality, occupants are more \u201cidiosyncratic\u201d to be predicted [8,54]. Naturally, they tend to seek control over their own living environment, striving for a personalized sense of comfort. This inclination is evident in common scenarios where people simultaneously use the air conditioner while opening a window or leaving a door ajar, potentially disrupting the optimal control strategy. Moreover, it is proved that the thermal comfort can directly affect occupant\u2019s productivity [10,16,55,56]. Occupant\u2019s work performance is suggested to be better when the temperature is at 21\u201322 ℃ [56]. The two options, increasing or decreasing PEC, present conflicting approaches, although both have the potential to save energy while improving thermal comfort of occupants. By decreasing PEC, optimal control strategies seize the control and try to optimize between building energy consumption and occupant thermal comfort, while thermal systems with PCS grant more control to occupants and save the energy by encouraging the users to consume less [14]. The question arises as to whether higher or lower PEC should be favoured, or if there exists a balance point between the two. Previous studies have primarily focused either on examining the effectiveness of specific control strategies or PCS devices in improving the thermal systems performance, or comparing between the effects of difference control strategies, [7,21\u201325,44,48,57\u201364]. However, there has been limited research on determining the optimal level of freedom to grant occupants in controlling the thermal system. To the best of our knowledge, no numerical comparisons nor statistical analysis have been conducted to investigate how the level of PEC affects the building energy performance as well as occupant thermal comfort and productivity in a systematic way. Understanding the optimal level of PEC and its influence on various aspects of thermal system performance remains an important area of research that requires further exploration and empirical analysis. 3 Methodology Although some studies have provided theoretical or experimental analyses of thermal systems' performance, they have primarily focused on explaining advancements in proposed thermal systems, while overlooking the impact of varying levels of PEC on system performance. With an aim to fill this gap, a field experiment was designed and conducted. 3.1 Experimental setting As shown in Fig. 3 (a), the experiment was conducted in an office room of 9.935 m2 at a university in Hong Kong for seven days in September 2021. The window-to-wall Ratio of the office room is approximately 10% and the weather data of the experiment days are shown in Table A1 of Appendix. As shown in Fig. 3(b), the office room provides an experimental condition where they can operate windows (both interior and exterior windows), window blinds (venetian blinds), a desk fan, and an air-conditioning system. The office room was equipped with individual thermal control, so that the occupants could adjust the indoor conditions according to their thermal preferences and comfort requirements where necessary. The preset of the thermal condition in the office room was designed aiming at providing a rather comfortable thermal condition while leaving adequate space for personal adjustment. Accordingly, the temperature of the room was preset to 27℃, the upper limit of the suggested comfort zone in ASHRAE-55 under 0.5 clo (clothing insulation), and also proved to be comfortable enough with fans in operation [13]. Additionally, subjects are also shown to be more obviously influenced by the psychological comfort perception under this temperature than in an ideal thermal environment at around 26 ℃ [19]. Two operable windows, one interior (see Fig. 4 (a and b)) facing the corridor and one exterior (see Fig. 4(c and d)), are in opposite directions in the office room. Both windows were closed in advance before the experiment commenced. The top half of the exterior window is shaded by venetian blinds which were opened in advance (see Fig. 5 ). The desk fan was switched on in advance at the minimum speed to provide a relatively satisfying thermal environment [13]. The fan is portable so that the occupants can adjust the height, the location, and the wind speed. All the participants were trained about the operation of the fan and were given adequate time to get themselves familiar with it. A photo and some additional information about the desk fan are shown in Fig. B1 and Table B1 of Appendix. 3.2 Experimental design Before the experiment starts, participants were guided to the same acclimatization room to cool down for ten minutes [64,65,9]. During this period, they were asked to sign in the consent form, information collection form, and read the guidelines carefully. They were also trained about the operation of the desk fan during the period. Considering the personal preference of thermal condition [18,66], a within-subject (repeated measures) design was adopted for the experiment, in which all the participants were engaged in every experimental condition of the entire experiment and the results are compared within a group of data from each participant. This contrasts with between-subject design, where each participant is only exposed to one experimental condition and comparison is made between data collected from different participants. Although a within-subject design leads to the carry-over effect, where the responses to a later condition could be affected by the previous one [9], the within-subject design eliminates the adverse impact of personal variances of thermal conditions preferences and ability on concentration. This setting has been applied widely in inspecting the occupants\u2019 thermal behaviors and comfort state [9,13,19,64]. To eliminate the impact subjective to the sequences of different thermal settings, a crossover study was performed [67], where the participants were randomly assigned to one of the four experimental conditions (see Table 1 ) according to the degree of PEC: (i) Condition 1 (No control): they had no control over the thermal environment at all, which means that they were not allowed to change any of the thermal conditions they were provided; (ii) Condition 2 (Limited control): they could only draw the blinds and/or open the window as they wish; (iii) Condition 3 (Partial control): they could draw the blinds, open the window, and/or adjust the portable fan setting as they wish; and (iv) Condition 4 (Full control): they could draw the curtain, open the window, and/or change the portable fan setting as they wish, and were given two opportunities (at the beginning and the middle of the session) to change the thermostat temperature of the air-conditioner. Each experiment includes all the four sessions and lasts for 66 min. The participants were exposed to each condition for eight minutes and were tested on their productivity during the last five minutes (see Fig. 6 ). A similar setting can be found in [65], and the length of each session was set short so that the participants could have a relatively direct comparison between different sessions. The thermal setting for different experimental conditions remains the same at 27℃ during all sessions except for Condition 4. To minimize the influence of the previous session, participants were guided to the acclimatization room for a wash-out after each thermal condition for eight minutes [67,68]. The experimenter resets the thermal setting in the office room during this period, and participants were also required to do the thermal questionnaire right after each session (details explained in Session 3.4). The humidity level in the acclimatization room was the same as the outdoor humidity level (at about 60% during experiment days). Accordingly, the temperature setting in the acclimatization room was expected to guarantee a comfortable indoor environment for participants (Predicted Mean Vote = 0) at 25℃, 60% Relative Humidity [69]. 3.3 Energy consumption calculation The energy consumption by the desk fan was monitored by an electricity meter, while the energy consumption by the air-conditioner was simulated by EnergyPlus. As shown in Fig. 7 , the model is built in DesignBuilder mimicking the layout and the location of the real building, about 22 m above the ground floor level with the external window facing 16.5° south-east. The sum of the energy consumption measured from the desk fan during the experiment time and simulated for the air-conditioner per hour was used to determine the total energy consumption in each session (8 min) in the experiment room. The simulation applied the weather template at Hong Kong Observation during the experiment period. To model the experiment situation, occupants are assumed to be in typical summer clothing (0.50 clo) with light office metabolic work (0.90 metabolic rate). The air-conditioner system is operated in Fan Coil Unit and air-cooled Chiller, with minimum fresh air supplied at 10L/s, 15℃, consistent with the HVAC setting in the experiment office room. The energy simulation calculation is done four steps per hour. The details of simulation settings are shown in Table A2 of Appendix. 3.4 Personal control, thermal comfort, and productivity assessment The personal control and thermal comfort of participants is assessed during the experiment by a questionnaire including two parts, assessing the degree of personal control and thermal comfort separately on a seven-point Likert scale (Table 2 ). As different occupants may have different subjective judgements on the control power they have received according to their understanding about the control system [11], we also surveyed on the degree participants feel that they have control of the thermal environment. To assess the degree of thermal comfort for each participant, their thermal sensation vote (TSV), thermal comfort vote (TCV), and thermal preference vote (TPV) were recorded [19,64,70]. The TSV describes an individual\u2019s sensation of the thermal environment, scaling from \u201ccold\u201d to \u201chot,\u201d and the TCV describes an individual\u2019s comfort of the thermal environment, scaling from \u201cuncomfortable\u201d to \u201ccomfortable.\u201d The TPV, on the other hand, describes an individual\u2019s preferences of thermal environment conditions, whether one prefers to change the thermal environment (\u201ccolder\u201d or \u201chotter\u201d) or not (\u201cmaintained\u201d). In addition to the thermal comfort and personal control of participants, their productivity is also assessed during the experiment based on a simple calculation test. The method was suggested by Seppänen et al. [71] as one of the tests relevant to office type work and chosen in this study. Additionally, pure numerical test as such is believed to eliminate the impact of language proficiency, as most of the participants are non-native speaker of English. The participants were asked to solve math problems including simple addition and subtraction calculations in each session as many as possible in the limited five minutes as an assessment on their productivity. Each question is worth one mark, and the overall score is used to evaluate how productive the participants are during the session. A similar test is also conducted as a part of productivity assessment in [72]. 4 Results and discussions 4.1 Subjects A total of 21 people were invited to participate in the experiment. G*Power analysis suggests that a minimum of the 12 subjects is required for the effective statistical test, with a total sample size of 48 and 4 measurement times [73,74]. This ensures that the probabilities of type I error controlled at 0.05 [38], providing sufficient evidence to support the acceptability of the chosen sample size. As shown in Fig. 8 (a), all participants were university students with ages ranging from 18 to 22. Among them, 52% of the participants (11 people) were male (see Fig. 8(b)), which indicates gender balance in the experiment. As shown in Fig. 8(c), 17 participants lived in Hong Kong (with moist subtropical mid-latitude climate) for at least 2 years. For the four participants whose year of residence in Hong Kong is less than one year, two of them are from Changsha, one from Shandong, and one from Shanghai, all of which are in moist subtropical mid-latitude climate zone. 4.2 Statistical analysis of the performance of thermal system using repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) To identify the statistical difference in the performance of thermal system with different degree of personal control, repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) is conducted for the experiment results in terms of PPC, thermal comfort (TSV, TCV, and TPV), productivity, and energy consumption. Before the analysis, Mauchly\u2019s test is adopted to test the sphericity. As shown in Table 3 , except for TCV, violation of sphericity is found in PPC, TSV, TPV, productivity, and energy consumption (Mauchly\u2019s W). Accordingly, Greenhouse-Geisser\u2019s adjusted degrees of freedom (df) are applied to analyze those five measures while the df without correction is applied to TCV analysis. Table 4 displays the results of the repeated measures ANOVA for the six measures. The results indicate that PPC and energy consumption showed a significant difference at a level of p < 0.01. This means that there is a notable variation in the perceived personal control and energy consumption across the examined conditions. TPV also exhibited statistical significance at a level of p < 0.05. This indicates that there is a meaningful difference in thermal preference concerning the conditions studied. On the other hand, no significant difference was found in productivity (p = 0.651). This suggests that productivity remained relatively consistent across the conditions examined. Comparatively, TSV and TCV did not demonstrate significant differences at the level of 0.05. However, they still exhibited some level of difference at a significance level of 0.1 (p < 0.1). This implies that while the variation in thermal sensation and thermal comfort was not as strong as in the previously mentioned measures, there is still some noticeable distinction between the conditions. The finding in this study, which indicates the absence of a relationship between PEC and productivity, may be influenced by the relatively short duration of each session and the specific testing approach employed in this research. As suggested in previous studies, the influence of thermal comfort on occupants\u2019 productivity can be highly subjective, depending on the type and complexity of the tasks being tested [24,72,75]. Contradictory conclusions are observed often in the literature. The findings of this study only suggest that, in general, no significant differences can be readily observed across various PEC conditions regarding productivity outcomes. 4.3 Comparative analysis of the performance of thermal system using post-hoc test To further investigate the thermal system\u2019s performance, the post-hoc test focused on PPC, TSV, TCV, TPV, and energy consumption, as these measures showed meaningful differences during the ANOVA analysis. As productivity did not show a statistically significant difference, it was not discussed further in the subsequent section of the report. 4.3.1 Perceived personal control As shown in Table 5 , the perceived personal control under no control (Condition 1) shows a significant difference from those under limited control (Condition 2), partial control (Condition 3), and full control (Condition 4), which demonstrates that providing at least one option for changing the thermal environment can significantly increase perceived control. Although there is no statistically significant difference in the PPC between limited control (Condition 2), partial control (Condition 3), and full control (Condition 4), there is a consistent upward trend as PEC improves, with the mean PPC increasing from −1.0 (No Control) to 0.33 (Limited Control), 1.095 (Partial Control), and 1.286 (Full Control), as illustrated in Fig. 9 . It is worth noting that occupants still felt that their level of control was relatively limited even when they had full control over the temperature, with the mean PPC (i.e., 1.286) falling well short from \u201cagree (2).\u201d 4.3.2 Thermal comfort As also indicated in the results of repeated measures ANOVA, there is generally no statistically difference in thermal comfort between conditions at 0.05 (see Table 5). Firstly, there is only a slight but insignificant difference (p = 0.093) in thermal sensation between partial control (Conditions 3; M = 0.143, SD = 0.727) and full control (Condition 4; M = 0.476, SD = 0.750). The thermal sensation under no control (Condition 1; M = −0.286, SD = 0.845) and limited control (Condition 2; M = −0.048, SD = 1.024) shows no significant difference from any other conditions. However, Fig. 10 exhibits a clear trend indicating that the thermal sensation tends to increase when higher PEC is permitted, despite the limited difference shown statistically. Nevertheless, the mean TSV is negative when no or limited control is allowed (i.e., Conditions 1 and 2), whereas the mean TSV turns to positive when partial or more control is allowed (i.e., Conditions 3 and 4). Overall, despite the statistically insignificant difference, the occupants generally felt warm in Conditions 1 and 2, and cool in Conditions 3 and 4, indicating that the cooling function of the thermal system is satisfactory in the context of thermal sensation when the fan and air-conditioner are in control. Second, there is no significant difference in occupants\u2019 thermal comfort at 0.05, but only slight difference between no control (Condition 1; M = 0.714, SD = 1.309) and full control (Condition 4; M = 1.571, SD = 1.112) at significance level of 0.1; the thermal comfort under limited control (Condition 2; M = 0.905, SD = 1.375) and partial control (Condition 3; M = 1.286, SD = 1.384) are not significantly different from any other conditions. This result indicates that the thermal comfort will only be improved when significant changes are made in PEC, otherwise the improvement would be neglectable in a short period of time as experienced in this study. Further study is suggested on this issue. Meanwhile, the mean TCV in any of the four conditions is positive, demonstrating that the thermal environment is generally satisfactory in all conditions, as shown in Fig. 11 . However, because the individual preference for thermal comfort is unique and subjective, there is a fair amount of variation in the results of the poll. Overall, more PEC generally leads to greater thermal comfort, though the increase varies amongst persons. Additionally, the findings of the analysis result supports the hypothesis suggested by He et al. [76] that fans are more efficient at enhancing thermal comfort when the outdoor temperature is relatively high. 75% of participants reported a higher TCV with partial control than that with limited control when the outdoor temperature exceeds 29 ℃ while only 33.33% of participants showed the same response with an outdoor temperature below 29 ℃. Third, although no statistical significance is found in the TPV between no control (Condition 1; M = 0.905, SD = 0.995), limited control (Condition 2; M = 0.905, SD = 0.889), partial control (Condition 3; M = 0.619, SD = 0.865), and full control (Condition 4; M = 0.381, SD = 0.973), there is a clear trend of TPV moving towards 0 (No change) when more control is given, as shown in Fig. 12 , especially when the fan or the setpoint temperature is operatable (i.e., Conditions 3 and 4). Here, contradictory results were shown between ANOVA and pairwise comparisons, having a significant ANOVA with non-significant pairwise comparisons. Dylan et al. [77] explained that as ANOVA and post-hoc test are based on different null hypotheses, a contradictory result can possibly take place, particularly when the sample size is small [78,79] while the omnibus significance is relatively weak [78]. Accordingly, this study has concluded that there is no significant difference in TPV even with a converging trend to 0 when more control is given, and studies with a larger sample size may lead to a more universal result. Generally, a safe conclusion could be drawn that PEC can enhance occupant thermal comfort slightly, but when very limited control is provided (i.e., Conditions 1 and 2), the improvement may not be statistically significant even though the subjective perceived control increases substantially. It can be explained that among thermal facilities, operating windows are less effective in improving the thermal environment compared to mechanically driven facilities such as fans and air-conditioners. Some participants claimed that they were unwilling to open the window because of the noise outside, which is a frequently overlooked aspect in the design of thermal systems. More focus should be placed on minimizing the negative effects of noise if the passive design is to be encouraged in thermal systems and further study is recommended. Despite the limited time allotted for each condition and the fact that the HVAC system sometimes failed to reach the desired setpoint during the sessions, participants reported that they could feel the fresh cool air directly from the air outlet above the desk once the setpoint was adjusted. This was also evident in the changes in the perceived control and thermal comfort levels observed in Condition 4. 4.3.3 Energy consumption The energy consumption under full control (Condition 4; M = 72.03, SD = 25.66) exhibits a significant difference from that under no control (Condition 1; M = 66.09, SD = 24.95), limited control (Condition 2; M = 66.52, SD = 25.10), and partial control (Condition 3; M = 66.29, SD = 25.41). The difference mainly stems from the operating energy of air-conditioners under full control. Consequently, no significant difference was observed between no control, limited control, and partial control, as occupants are not allowed to adjust the set-point setting of the air-conditioner, limiting the energy consumption of air-conditioning system low with a set-point of 27 ℃. Even under partial control (Condition 3) where participants were allowed to operate the desk fan, the energy consumption shows no significance difference from that under lower degree of control (Conditions 1 and 2) as the energy consumption from the desk fan was substantially low. The present finding partially contradicts the results in [29], where higher level of PPC is consistently found to be associated with lower energy consumption based on EnergyPlus simulations. This discrepancy may be stemmed from the differences in experiment design, as the participants in [29] have no access to setpoint control, and the unpredictable nature of occupants\u2019 behavior. 4.4 Relationship between the perceived personal control and thermal comfort In addition to the analysis about the variations in thermal system performance across the four PEC conditions provided, the relationship between the perceived personal control (PPC) and thermal comfort is also examined and compared to that of PEC. Here, PPC refers to the occupants\u2019 subjective evaluation of the degree of control they perceive over the thermal conditions, in contrast to the objective PEC conditions preestablished in the experiment. As defined by Hellwig [11], PPC encompasses a combination of psychological effect, where occupants feel more thermally comfortable because they believe they have control over the thermal environment [19], and physical effects, where occupants possess the ability to set the temperature according to their preferences [30]. To explain how PPC influences different thermal comfort indicators, a linear regression is performed by comparing the TSV, TCV, and TPV with the PPC in each condition (Fig. 13 ). Chi-Square tests are applied in comparing each participant\u2019s ratings of thermal comfort indicators under different PPCs, and the significance (p-value) is also presented. Generally, TSV rises as PPC increases, although a considerable level of individual variance is observed in their thermal sensations, yielding a Chi-test p = 0.4612. This finding is consistent with the finding in [29], where a significant distinction was discovered by re-categorizing the seven-point Likert scale TSV into three categories. The association between TCV and PPC demonstrated a significant rise with Chi-test p < 0.001, from a mean of 0 when the PPC is at −3 to 2.83 when the PPC is at 3. Comparing to the previous results of repeated measures ANOVA and post-hoc test (in Section 4.3), where a higher level of significance was found in the difference in TSV in relation to PEC, TCV may have a closer relationship to PPC. In other words, the physical control of thermal facilities is more effective in influencing the objective thermal sensations, whereas the perceived control reflected by the occupants, regardless of whether thermal facilities are effective or not, makes the occupants feel thermally comfortable. The link between TPV and PPC is interestingly inconsistent across the whole range of PPC (-3 to 3), but rather significant when PPC is non-negative (0 to 3) (Chi-test p = 0.0309). The TPV relatively remains constant at a mean of 1 when PPC is negative (-3, −2, or −1), whereas the mean TPV decreased from 1.235 to −0.167 when PPC climbed from 0 to 3. In this regard, PPC tends to have stronger effects on occupants\u2019 TPV under higher PPC levels, compared to the lower ones. This indicates that when occupants believe they have control over the thermal environment, PPC will play a notable role on their thermal preferences; however, when this belief is absent, no significant effects are observed. 5 Conclusion This study covers the research gap in defining how different levels of PEC affect the performance of thermal systems. An experiment was conducted in an office room in Hong Kong under four conditions according to the degree of personal control with 21 participants. The building energy consumption, occupant thermal comfort, and their productivity were observed during the experiment and the result was analyzed based on statistical analysis. The following findings from the experiment are noteworthy: \u2022 Increasing Personal Environmental Control results in only marginal improvements in occupants\u2019 thermal comfort, with no significant differences observed between various PEC scenarios. However, the building energy efficiency experiences a considerable decline, averaging at 11.35%, once they have control of the thermostat temperature. This suggests that excessively high levels of personal control in HVAC systems may not always be beneficial. There appears to be an upper limit to the degree of control offered between allowing the occupants to use electric fan and adjust the HVAC thermostat freely. \u2022 Controlling either the machine-driven fan or the set-point temperature of the air-conditioner has been found more applicable to improve occupants\u2019 thermal comfort than the window. It could be due to the specific experiment condition set in this study and further study with larger sample size is suggested. \u2022 Subjective Perceived Personal Control tends to influence thermal comfort significantly, compared to thermal sensation and thermal preferences. Comparingly, objective personal environmental control is found more relevant to thermal sensation, but the difference between scenario is not significant and shows high individual variation. \u2022 Perceived Personal Control exhibits a notable impact on thermal preferences when occupants believe they have control over the thermal environment; however, when this belief is absent, no significant effects are observed. \u2022 In this study, no significant relationship is found between Personal Environmental Control and occupants\u2019 productivity. Novel to this study, a field study given various alternatives of PEC design was performed, proving that while PPC contributes to providing a comfortable thermal environment, physically altering PEC has an insignificant impact on thermal comfort improvement. This finding suggests that providing excessive freedom to the occupants in controlling HVAC may not always be advantageous, and there should be an upper limit to the degree of control offered. While this is less addressed in the existing studies, this study also examines the influence of PEC and PPC separately and a comparison was made in between. This study also contributes to the relevant research area by reviewing the current practices of PEC separately in thermal systems implementing PCS and systems using optimized control strategy for the first time. Both of the two options, increasing PEC through PCS or decreasing PEC but applying optimized control strategies, have the potential to save energy while improving thermal comfort of occupants. As thermal comfort and energy efficiency continue to be key considerations in building design and operation, finding optimal level of freedom to grant occupants in controlling the thermal system remains an ongoing area of research and exploration. This study can be understood as a pilot study to compare the performance of thermal systems under different PEC designs. Several limitations, however, must be acknowledged. It is worth noting that the participants in this study are predominantly young college students, as the experiment was conducted on a university campus and recruiting subjects proved challenging. Even though, the results demonstrate a diversity of personal thermal comfort and preference in PEC. It is possible that future studies with a larger sample size may lead to increased uncertainty in the conclusions drawn. Moreover, the experimental sessions were set to a short duration of 8 min to enable direct comparisons, but the HVAC system occasionally failed to attain the desired setpoint during these sessions, as indicated in Section 4.3.2. Although the participants\u2019 reports indicate that they could perceive the fresh cool air emanating from the air outlet above the deck when the setpoint was adjusted, it is advisable for future studies to adopt longer experiment settings. This will ensure the effectiveness of the setpoint adjustment and verify that occupants can genuinely feel the difference in the indoor environment. Another success factor for similar projects could be a more systematic categorization in PEC and consequently a clearer and more scientific-based distinction in classifying degrees of freedom given to the occupants.

        "dc:description": "Personal environmental control (PEC) is an energy-saving approach that empowers occupants with the freedom to regulate the indoor thermal environment, ensuring comfort while conserving energy by conditioning only the occupied space based on individual preferences. However, necessary information to support the practical application of PEC is still missing. Specifically, how the degree of freedom given to occupants changes the building energy efficiency, occupant thermal comfort, and productivity has not yet been investigated systematically. This research (i) investigates the application of PEC in existing thermal systems; (ii) examines the effects of PEC on the aforementioned three criteria for assessing the performance of thermal systems; and (iii) suggests an optimized thermal system incorporating the concept of PEC for a better performance of thermal systems. Primary data was collected by experimentation and observation among 21 participants under four different conditions in a field study in Hong Kong. Repeated measures ANOVA was applied in analyzing the thermal ratings, the energy consumption, and the productivity of participants. The outcome of this study shows that a higher PEC can only lead to marginal improvement of thermal comfort, but the building energy efficiency drops when they set the thermostat temperature themselves under a condition that they are given full control. No clear relationship is found in this study between the PEC and occupant productivity. As a pilot study to compare the performance of thermal systems under different PEC designs, this study contributes to the research field into a practical energy-efficient design of thermal systems by enhancing the occupants\u2019 personal control of the thermal environment.",
