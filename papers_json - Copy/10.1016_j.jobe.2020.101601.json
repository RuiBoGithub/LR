One method of satisfying the continuously increasing industrial, commercial, and residential electrical-energy demands of consumers in smart grids is to use an Internet-of-things (IoT) service-oriented electrical-energy management system (EMS) to intrusively monitor and manage electrical loads, which can effectively react to demand-response schemes for demand-side management (DSM). Nonintrusive load monitoring (NILM), a viable cost-effective load disaggregation technique, has recently gained considerable attention as a nonintrusive alternative to EMS in the research field of smart grids. This paper presents a smart IoT-oriented home EMS founded on trainingless multi-objective evolutionary computing-based NILM for DSM in a smart grid. Evolutionary computing-based NILM is considered and addressed as a multi-objective combinatorial optimization problem. The proposed NILM technique can determine the electrical appliances based on their individual electrical characteristics extracted from composite electrical-load consumption with no intrusive deployment of smart plugs or power meters. A fully nonintrusive NILM alternative is considered and proposed. In addition, this alternative is different from conventional NILM because conventional NILM considers artificial intelligence including artificial neural networks (NNs) and deep NN as load classifiers of NILM where training and retraining stages and a hyperparameter tuning procedure are required. The proposed smart IoT-oriented home EMS was experimentally investigated with the trainingless multi-objective evolutionary computing-based NILM in a real house environment. The experimental results confirm that the proposed methodology is feasible. Keywords Artificial intelligence Home energy management system Internet of things Multi-objective combinatorial optimization Nonintrusive load monitoring 1 Introduction Advanced artificial intelligence (AI) across Internet of things (IoT) is trending in the current society ranging from smart homes, buildings, and factories to smart cities. Smart cities support daily life by providing complete smart surveillance, healthcare, energy management, and many other services. Currently, because of global warming and climate change, effective monitoring and management of continuously increasing industrial, commercial, and residential electrical-energy demands of consumers in smart grids are vital. To improve electrical-energy efficiency, systems for electrical-energy management [1\u20136] have been developed to intrusively monitor and manage industrial, commercial, and residential electrical appliances, which react to demand response (DR) signals for demand-side management (DSM) in smart grids. DSM in smart grids encourages consumers to optimize their electrical-energy usage by taking action to reduce or shift loads according to the market prices of electricity in which financial incentives are offered [7]. Smart homes are linked using advanced metering infrastructure, automated metering, and advanced data management within a smart grid or in a smart city where IoT, a technical extension of information and communication technologies, is combined with AI to improve daily life. Home energy management systems (HEMSs) enable households to effectively manage their entire electric-energy consumption by providing them with detailed information about the usage of appliance-level electric-energy consumption according to individual electrical home appliances and allowing them to precisely control their power-intensive electrical home appliances [8]. In HEMSs that are developed for smart homes in a smart grid, data acquisition (DAQ) is done using smart plugs or power meters that intrusively collect power-consumption information on individual electrical home appliances [9,10] as well as sensors that collect home-environment data such as indoor temperature and humidity, CO or CO2, and luminosity [9]. HEMS installed in a smart home in a smart grid is used to monitor and manage electrical home appliances via intrusive deployment of smart plugs or power meters installed for/inside individual electrical home appliances to be controlled and operated in response to DR schemes. In HEMSs, the implementation in a residential scenario of DSM in a smart grid burdens the consumers with high investment involving annual maintenance costs [11\u201314]. In contrast to HEMSs, nonintrusive load monitoring (NILM) or nonintrusive appliance load monitoring [11,15\u201334], which is a viable cost-effective load-disaggregation technique, has recently gained considerable attention in the field of research of smart grids [11,35,36]. NILM does not require intrusive deployment of smart plugs or power meters to track fine-grained individual electric-energy consumption. In NILM, only a single minimal set of plug-panel sensors, i.e., current and voltage sensors, is needed for aggregate or composite electricity-data measurements. Traditionally, load monitoring in electrical-energy management is performed in an intrusive manner. Smart plugs or power meters that are installed for/inside major electrical appliances are deployed in the field. In contrast, NILM acquires the aggregate or composite electricity data such as electric-energy consumption from a single minimal set of plug-panel sensors, i.e., current and voltage sensors, installed and deployed at the main control of the electric panel or distribution board of a residential environment. It then analyzes the acquired data through data-science analytics. The operational status of the electrical appliances is deduced through NILM analysis. The potential capacity of the power reduction for DR can be estimated through further analysis of NILM for DSM. NILM has attracted widespread attention. It was first investigated in the early 1980s by George W. Hart, Ed Kern, and Fred Schweppe at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with funding from the Electric Power Research Institute [16,17]. NILM, a. k.a. Load disaggregation, can be regarded as a load-classification task, which can be solved using AI such as the simulated annealing algorithm [18], backpropagation artificial neural networks (BP-ANNs) [11,20\u201324] (ANNs in AI are powerful connections that are bio-inspired by biological NNs), neuro-fuzzy synergism [13,25], a hybridization of BP-ANNs with particle swarm optimization [27], dynamic time warping combined with fuzzy c-means clustering [28], and deep learning or deep NN [29\u201333]. Recent advances have made deep learning or deep NN in AI a dominant approach for classification in the fields of image processing and speech recognition, which is capable of realizing unsupervised feature learning or automatic feature extraction. Researchers in Ref. [30\u201333] have implemented deep learning or deep NN in NILM. Whereas the above-mentioned AI-based NILM paradigms that were developed for DSM have been investigated, minimal attention has been paid to developing AI, such as evolutionary computing, in NILM, which is treated as combinatorial optimization [16,34]. Therefore, a smart IoT-oriented HEMS founded on trainingless multi-objective evolutionary computing or genetic algorithm (GA)-based NILM, which is considered as multi-objective combinatorial optimization for DSM in a smart grid, is proposed in this paper. The addressed NILM is a multi-objective combinatorial optimization problem that is solved by trainingless evolutionary computing, GA. Active power (real power) P and reactive power Q are extracted from the composite electrical-load consumption as a representation of fitness for evolutionary computing, and they are assessed through evolutionary computing to distinguish the different types of electrical home appliances. An NILM algorithm based on GA can be developed and used to decompose the aggregated circuit-level power consumption into its appliance-level power consumption, which does not span a relatively long period of time in the NILM [35]. In the present study, experiments are performed to investigate the smart IoT-oriented HEMS founded on trainingless multi-objective GA-based NILM. The major contributions of this study are highlighted as follows. ● A smart HEMS that considers a trainingless multi-objective evolutionary computing-based NILM technique for DSM is developed. ● In practice, an AI-based paradigm in NILM is developed where the training stage is intrusive because the electrical appliances monitored by the NILM in the fields of interest are instrumented for their aggregated (rated) power consumption and used to train the AI models. Its test or validation stage is nonintrusive because no instrumentation for appliance-level power consumption is required. In this paper, a fully nonintrusive alternative of NILM is considered and proposed. The proposed NILM is a trainingless fully nonintrusive alternative where, during the preliminary NILM process, no instrumentation is required for the electrical appliances; only the historical data of their recorded states (state records) from their switching gadget instead of their power-measurement unit comprising remote load control are required. No access to the individual electrical appliances is necessary for making power measurements. This provides a very convenient and effective approach of gathering load data non-intrusively, compared with traditional means of attaching a power-measurement unit on each of the individual electrical appliances. ● The proposed NILM is based on trainingless multi-objective evolutionary computing, which is different from the AI-based methods such as ANNs or deep NNs in which a training process, a retraining stage for new electrical appliances, and a hyperparameter tuning procedure are required. Its mathematical model is multi-objective combinatorial optimization solved by trainingless evolutionary computing. Evolutionary computing is a family of metaheuristics, which is suitable for combinatorial optimization and provides reasonable solutions to computationally intractable (NP-complete) problems most of the time. In NILM, an ANN trained during its learning process for load identification is run over collected training data instances. Also, it is repeated iteratively. This is time-consuming. By contrast, the proposed NILM approach identifies electrical appliances based on combinatorial optimization, a pattern matching-like mechanism, that potential electrical appliances are matched, through meta-heuristics, with respect to measured composite electric-energy consumption with a minimum error. The proposed NILM approach against an ANN-style mechanism in NILM does not span a relatively long period of time in the NILM. The rest of this paper is structured as follows. The methodology of the proposed smart IoT-oriented HEMS based on trainingless multi-objective evolutionary computing or GA-based NILM for DSM in a smart grid is described in Section 2. Section 3 presents the experiments. Finally, this paper is concluded with its future work in Section 4. 2 Methodology The trainingless multi-objective evolutionary computing or GA-based NILM approach is compared with a benchmark IoT-oriented HEMS presented in Ref. [25]. Section 2.1 defines the basic NILM, Section 2.2 briefly introduces the IoT service-oriented HEMS, and Section 2.3 details the evolutionary computing or GA-based NILM approach. 2.1 Definition of the basic NILM NILM is a viable load-monitoring approach that nonintrusively breaks down the circuit-level power consumption to the appliance-level power consumption. Let P(t) in watts be a measure of the composite power consumption at time slice t in the field of interest. In addition, for electrical appliance i among N electrical appliances, its rated-power consumption is denoted by P i in watts, where electrical appliance i can be considered as a different type of appliance if it undergoes multi-state transitions. At each time slice, P(t) can be assumed as the sum of the power consumption from an operational electrical appliance(s) in the field of interest such that P(t) = ∑ i = 1 N P i · x i ( t ) + P b a s e . x i (t), which belongs to {0, 1}, indicates the ON/OFF status of electrical appliance i, and P base in watts is the base load in the field of interest. P base can be statistically computed where no major operating electrical appliance is considered for, measured with, and averaged from the composite real-power consumption. P base can be regarded as background noise from small electrical appliances [12] such as smartphone chargers and laptops as phantom loads. P(t) \u2012 P base is a superposition of ∑ i = 1 N P i · x i ( t ) . The aim of the basic NILM in such a field of interest is to build a mathematical model that can identify or infer x i (t) with P i from P(t) observed at time slice t [35]. 2.2 IoT service-oriented HEMS as a benchmark for intrusively identifying appliance-level power consumption HEMSs work as a bidirectional communication interface between the home environment, which is aware of the DR signals based on the DR market, and power utilities, which analyze the electric-energy consumption data gathered from smart houses, implement the DR programs, and optimize the electric-energy consumption of consumers in the downstream sectors of a smart grid [36,37]. These factors are crucial for DSM in a smart grid to monitor, manage, and optimize the electric-energy consumption in the residential environments. A typical HEMS in a smart-home environment mainly consists of a smart meter connected to the power utility via an advanced-metering infrastructure and used to receive the DR schemes for DSM, a central energy management controller (EMC) connected via the Internet to a cloud server with user-centric IoT service-oriented applications, and electrical home appliances intrusively monitored in a smart grid. The preliminaries of the HEMS that utilizes the proposed NILM approach are provided here. In the previous work in Ref. [25], an HEMS based on two-way ZigBee wireless networking technology was developed. The block diagram of the HEMS [25\u201327] that utilizes the proposed trainingless multi-objective GA-based NILM is shown in Fig. 1 . This HEMS consists of three entities. The first is a power company-owned traditional wattmeter that is upgraded as a smart meter for transmitting the composite power-consumption data and receiving the DR signals for DSM. The second is a residential environment where different types of electrical appliances are monitored. The third is an EMC that utilizes the NILM, which is implemented in Python and used to come up with a breakdown of circuit-level power consumption of the residential environment into appliance-level power consumption of its monitored electrical appliances measured by plug-panel current and voltage sensors instead of plug-load smart plugs or power meters. Fig. 1 shows that the home environment that implements the HEMS with the NILM approach is connected to the smart grid via an advanced-metering infrastructure. In this scenario, a power company-owned smart meter [27], instead of a traditional wattmeter in which two-way communication between the consumer and power utility is not possible, is installed in the home environment to transmit the electric-energy consumption data and receive the DR programs for the DSM. DR is an effective and viable mechanism for DSM in smart grids, which motivates consumers to shift or optimize their electrical-energy demands during peak-load periods. In the smart-home environment, identifying the electrical home appliances is very important because the monitored electrical home appliances are managed and optimized with respect to the DR programs for DSM in a smart grid. In the present study, the IoT service-oriented HEMS [25\u201327] with a novel NILM approach is proposed. In the HEMS shown in Fig. 1, the home area network can be based on wired or wireless communication technology to achieve a variety of user-centric IoT service-oriented applications. The core entity of the HEMS in Ref. [25], i.e., the home gateway or EMC, which worked as the main controller of the HEMS, was based on the following: 1. An Advanced Reduced Instruction Set Computing/RISC Machine (ARM)® Cortex™-A9-based embedded system (Texas Instruments Inc., Dallas, USA) configured using LAMP [an Apache HTTP Web server (Apache Software Foundation, Forest Hill, MD, USA)]. 2. MySQL® relational database (Oracle Corporation, Redwood City, USA). 3. PHP (PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) general-purpose scripting language (Rasmus Lerdorf, Qeqertarsuaq/Disko Island, Greenland) on Linux™ Operating System (Linus Torvalds, Helsinki, Suomi)) [27]. The configured MySQL® relational database was an enabled remote-access database [27]. The EMC communicated with ZigBee communication-equipped smart plugs or power meters to intrusively identify the electric-energy consumption from individual electrical home appliances for DSM in the residential environment. The electrical home appliances were monitored via an intrusive deployment of smart plugs or power meters. This process was both laborious and cost intensive [8\u201311]. ZigBee (the IEEE 802.15.4 standard) (ZigBee Alliance, Davis, USA) [38] is arguably the most popular technology for creating wireless sensor networks [27] and has been included in some of the latest commercial [39] and academic home automation implementations, including water-pump control with efficient energy consumption in a smart fish farm [40\u201342]. By means of the ZigBee wireless communication network, the HEMS communicating with the monitored household appliances can perform remote direct or distributed load control for DSM [27]. The EMC in the residential environment in Ref. [25] also worked as an in-home display configured on the EMC to provide remote monitoring of electrical home appliances and devices in the home environment for homeowners. In the home environment in Ref. [25], the HEMS acquired the composite electrical-load consumption or electricity data via a single minimal set of plug-panel current and voltage sensors from major electrical home appliances monitored through the intrusive deployment of ZigBee communication-equipped smart plugs or power meters. Fig. 1 shows that the common gateway interface is programmed in Perl and configured on the EMC [27]. An HTTP Web server-based user interface that shows the detailed electric-energy consumption data via access to the Internet is designed and implemented. Homeowners can dynamically interact with the HTTP Web server configured on the EMC. A universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter, which is an RS232 remote-terminal unit-format protocol, is used in the HEMS [27]. An evolutionary computing or GA-based NILM approach that addresses the load disaggregation as a multi-objective combinatorial optimization problem for DSM in the home environment [25] is investigated in the present study. Compared with the HEMS benchmark in Ref. [25], the NILM approach described in Section 2.3 nonintrusively identifies the individual electrical home appliances without deploying the ZigBee communication-equipped smart plugs or power meters in the home environment. The assumption made in Ref. [13,25,26] was that each electrical home appliance enrolled for participation in DR and controlled and monitored in the home environment is equipped with a wireless remote controller such as an infrared (IR) controller [27] that can function as a DR switch. Thus, each appliance (whose electric-energy consumption is deduced through NILM) was remotely controlled using the user-centric IoT service-oriented applications offered to homeowners. The composite electric-energy consumption or load combinations acquired by the single minimal set of plug-panel current and voltage sensors were preprocessed or labeled through sensor fusion or data fusion. The proposed NILM approach is implemented in Python [43], which is a high-level and general-purpose programming language created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991 and suited for HEMS applications with the proposed evolutionary computing or GA-based NILM approach. The proposed evolutionary computing or GA-based NILM approach is described in Section 2.3. 2.3 Appliance-level power consumption nonintrusively inferred through trainingless multi-objective combinatorial optimization The proposed trainingless multi-objective evolutionary computing or GA-based NILM approach [25] involves disaggregating the composite electric-energy consumption into appliance-level power consumption based on the electrical characteristics, i.e., features P and Q, extracted from the individual electrical appliances. The workflow of the process is illustrated in Fig. 2 . The NILM in Fig. 2 consists of the DAQ of the aggregate electric-energy consumption from the composite current and voltage signals obtained by a single minimal set of plug-panel current and voltage sensors, feature extraction of P and Q to create a feature space, and load identification of executing the evolutionary computing-based NILM, which is a trainingless multi-objective combinatorial optimization search process, (which was solved by the GA and used to infer the operational status of the individual electrical home appliances in Ref. [25]). The monitored electrical home appliances are labeled with user intervention or through preliminary experiments. When the raw composite electricity data and current and voltage signals are acquired and digitized, feature extraction via steady-state analysis and load identification via the trainingless multi-objective GA-based NILM approach are performed. In practice, an AI-based paradigm such as those in Ref. [11,13,20\u201327], and [30\u201333] in NILM is developed in which the training stage is intrusive because the electrical appliances monitored through the NILM are instrumented and measured for their rated power consumption to train the AI models. Its test or validation stage is nonintrusive because no instrumentation for appliance-level power consumption is required. The smart plugs or power meters used for monitored electrical appliances in the training stage, which is a preliminary process of NILM, of the AI models in NILM are removed. The proposed NILM approach is a trainingless and fully nonintrusive alternative that, during the preliminary process of the NILM shown in Fig. 2, it does not require any instrumentation for electrical appliances where only the types enrolled initially with user intervention and used as labels in AI are required. Furthermore, only the consideration and analysis of the historical data from their recorded states (state records) are involved where the signals such as the IR remote control, Wi-Fi flows [44,45] that interpret the occupant energy-use patterns, and walk-through visit [46] in the environment are stored in a database for load combinations of electrical appliances. These are then analyzed in a data-fusion fashion for their consumed real power estimated by the proposed NILM approach from the aggregated electric-energy consumption. The Wi-Fi flows in the field of interest could be utilized for the DSM to understand or interpret the occupant energy-use patterns [44,45]. A walk-through visit [46] in the field of interest can also be employed. In the present study, no interview about the occupant behavior and operating characteristics of the occupant electrical appliances used and measured with an intrusive deployment of a power meter(s) is needed. In the preliminary NILM process shown in Fig. 2, the electrical appliances are remotely controlled. They can be smart appliances equipped with a switching gadget instead of a power-measurement unit that comprises remote load control. No access to individual appliances is necessary for making power measurements. This provides a very convenient and effective approach of gathering load data non-intrusively, compared with traditional means of attaching a power-measurement unit on each of them. Where, their consumed real power can be deduced or estimated by means of the proposed NILM approach. Fig. 2 shows that the load combinations of the remotely controllable electrical home appliances used in the residential environment are labeled through data alignment in data fusion. Only the types as labels of the electrical home appliances initially enrolled with user intervention are required for participation in DR programs and monitored by the proposed NILM approach. The electrical home appliances are assumed and operated as wirelessly and remotely controllable electrical appliances, which serve as smart home appliances where they respond to the received DR signals. However, their power consumption is deduced by the NILM. Moreover, the potential capacity of the power reduction in the residential environment for DSM can be statistically estimated through a further analysis of by the NILM [26]. For the proposed NILM, trainingless multi-objective combinatorial optimization, instead of AI such as ANNs or deep NNs, which involve a training or retraining stage, is considered. The proposed NILM is considered as a multi-objective combinatorial optimization problem. The fitness function clarified for the NILM solved by the GA is mathematically expressed in Eq. (1), which shall be described later. The NILM implemented in Python is run on a laptop linked via a USB interface with a National Instruments (NI)™ DAQ device (National Instruments, Austin, TX, USA). During the DAQ process shown in Fig. 2, the aggregated raw analog current and voltage signals acquired by a single minimal set of plug-panel current and voltage sensors are simultaneously and continuously sampled and digitized by the NI™ DAQ device. The specification of the plug-panel current and voltage sensors connected to the DAQ device is presented in Section 3. The proposed NILM performs feature extraction and load identification of the analyzable digitized signals. At each time point, for example, every 20 s, the NILM takes a feature reading, analyzes the data, and then deduces whether each of the electrical home appliances is being operated through a trainingless multi-objective combinatorial search process using GA. P and Q, which represent the individual electrical home appliances, are extracted from the signals. Load identification is performed onsite and online via the trainingless multi-objective evolutionary computing. The fitness function clarified for the NILM or load disaggregation, which is considered as a multi-objective combinatorial optimization problem that is solved by the GA that mimics the principle of biological evolution [3,47,48], is mathematically clarified in a weighted-sum form in Eq. (1). (1) F i t n e s s = ω 1 f 1 + ω 2 f 2 s . t . 1 ) 0 ≤ ∑ i = 1 N X i ( t ) ≤ N . 2 ) x i ( t ) is either 0 ( indicating an OFF status ) or 1 ( indicating an ON status ) . 3 ) The conductor of the electrical wiring in the house environment cannot be overloaded for the electrical home appliances selected with x i ( t ) during the evolution. where f 1 = e x p ( − α 1 ( | ( P ( t ) − P b a s e ) − ∑ i = 1 N P i · x i ( t ) | ) ) f 2 = e x p ( − α 2 ( | ( Q ( t ) − Q b a s e ) − ∑ i = 1 N Q i · x i ( t ) | ) ) In Eq. (1), f 1 and f 2 are two objective functions that are weighted by constants w 1 and w 2, respectively, and solved by evolutionary computing in the proposed NILM in this paper. N represents the total number of monitored electrical home appliances. x i (t), which must evolve through evolutionary computing, indicates the state of the ith electrical home appliance (either ON or OFF) at time slice t ( x is an n-dimensional Boolean vector). Constants α 1 and α 2 are scaling factors of the two objective functions f 1 and f 2, respectively. P(t) in f 1 and Q(t) in f 2 denote the composite electrical-load consumption measured and acquired at time slice t. P base in f 1 and Q base in f 2 represent the base loads measured and statistically computed from phantom loads in the home environment. P i in f 1 and Q i in f 2 stand for the power profile of the ith electrical home appliance. P base and Q base are statistically computed when no major operating electrical appliance is considered for, measured onsite with, and averaged from the composite electrical-load consumption. They are regarded as background noise from the small electrical appliances as phantom loads. P i and Q i are statistically computed in which the mutually exclusive operational electrical appliances are considered for, measured onsite with, and averaged from their measured real and reactive power. In Eq. (1), the two objectives can be assigned equal weights as w 1 = w 2 and w 1 + w 2 = 1. Electrical home appliances have resistive, inductive, or capacitive loads. For further investigation, harmonics related to the total harmonic distortion (THD) can be extracted from the acquired and digitized current and voltage signals and considered as another objective function used in Eq. (1) for multi-objective combinatorial optimization in the NILM. The fitness function in Eq. (1) is solved by the GA according to a composition of sets of individual appliance-level electrical-load consumption P i and Q i from x i (t) with respect to the measured and acquired composite electrical-load consumption P(t) and Q(t) for the NILM. In Eq. (1), the measured composite electrical-load consumption represents the summation of the electrical-load consumption of all monitored and operated individual electrical home appliances. In Eq. (1), the GA is used to evolve the correct x i (t) related to optimizing or maximizing the fitness function, i.e., minimizing the error in Eq. (1) between the summation of the superimposed appliance-level electrical-load consumption and the measured composite electrical-load consumption. The GA is used to determine the correct x i (t) from the composite electrical-load consumption measured and acquired at time slice t. On the basis of the composite electrical-load consumption, the GA deduces which electrical home appliance(s) is (are) being used at time slice t. For load identification using the multi-objective combinatorial optimization search process in Eq. (1) or the NILM, P and Q are adopted as electrical features to distinguish among the electrical home appliances considering the resistive, inductive, and capacitive loads [19,49]. The GA that is used to meta-heuristically solve Eq. (1) searches for the optimal appliance combination x i (t) to be evolved to minimize the error between the summation of superimposed appliance-level electrical-load consumption ΣP i ∙x i (t) and ΣQ i ∙x i (t) in x i (t) and the measured composite electrical-load consumption (P(t) − P base ) and (Q(t) − Q base ). The sets (P i , Q i ) and (P base , Q base ) are stored in the MySQL® relational database. The GA used to solve Eq. (1) is a population-based meta-heuristic and stochastic optimization algorithm bio-inspired by the process of natural selection, i.e., Darwin's theory of biological evolution. To codify the NILM, the electrical home appliances are encoded as chromosomes, as illustrated in Fig. 3 , and undergo evolution using the GA. Fig. 3 shows that the binary vector, which represents a chromosome in the GA, codifies the electrical home appliances. If x i (t) = 1, the ith electrical home appliance is ON at time slice t; otherwise, it is OFF. The basic principle of the combinatorial optimization of x i (t) in Eq. (1) is illustrated in Fig. 4 . Only P is considered and shown [34,35]. The electrical home appliances or combinations of appliances with similar P values are ambiguously distinguished. The GA cannot distinguish the electrical appliances, including the combinations of appliances with similar P values. As a result, Q, which is an additional or supplementary electrical feature, is needed for load identification. In this study, the fitness function, Eq. (1), considering Q is defined in a weighted-sum manner because the composite P and Q values represent the composition or superposition of the appliance-level P and Q values from the individual electrical appliances in the electrical wiring. The flowchart of the GA that is used to solve Eq. (1) and perform onsite and online load identification in the proposed NILM is shown in Fig. 5 . An initial population is constituted by a set of randomly generated chromosomes and is started through the iterative cycles. Two types of GA operators are utilized in this study, namely, genetic and evolution operators. The genetic operators perform crossover and mutation operations, and the evolution operator mimics natural selection [47]. A roulette-wheel selection, i.e., fitness-proportional selection, is adopted. This method selects a new population for the next generation with respect to a probability distribution based on the evaluated fitness values. In the proportional-selection procedure such as the roulette-wheel selection, the selection probability of a chromosome is proportional to its fitness. A tendency exists for a few super chromosomes to dominate the selection process in early generations and to prematurely converge. In a GA, super chromosomes dominate the population by maintaining too many copies of them to generate offspring for the next population, thus resulting in premature convergence of the algorithm. A strategy that detects duplicated chromosomes in a population and discards them (the initialization procedure of a GA can be used to fill the vacancy of the population) can be implemented to prevent the super chromosomes from allowing premature convergence of the GA. Scaling and ranking mechanisms can also be developed and used. In GA, an enlarged (μ + λ) sampling space can be considered [47]. In this sampling space, μ parents and λ offspring compete for survival. The μ best offspring and parents are selected as new parents to form a new population in the next generation of the GA. An elitist strategy is implemented. This strategy ensures that the best chromosome is passed onto the next generation even if it is not selected through the roulette-wheel selection process. Fig. 5 shows that the genetic operators facilitate an efficient GA search and guide the GA into new regions. The crossover operations facilitate exploration of the search space, whereas the mutation operations facilitate exploitation of the search space [47]. In a GA, the mutation operation specifies how the algorithm performs small random changes in the individuals in a population to create mutated offspring. The adaptive crossover and mutation probability rates can realize the twin goals of maintaining population diversity and sustaining the convergence capacity of the evolutionary computation. However, for convenience, constant crossover and mutation probabilities are used in the present study. In addition, various meta-heuristics such as swarm intelligence can be used to solve the NILM in Eq. (1). However, selection of the meta-heuristic algorithm is not the main focus of the present study. Fig. 5 shows that the iterative cycle of applying the genetic operators with the elitist strategy after the selection process is completed continues until a pre-specified maximum of generations is met. The GA shown in Fig. 5 is used to infer the appliance-level power consumption of the individual electrical appliances, i.e., x i (t) in Eq. (1), from composite circuit-level P and Q where their averaged base load is considered and subtracted from them. 3 Demonstration The experimental validation of the smart IoT service-oriented HEMS [21] based on the trainingless multi-objective GA-based NILM for DSM is presented in this section. The experimental setup is shown in Fig. 6 , and the NILM is implemented in Python. The major electrical home appliances monitored in line branch 1 (L1) of the electrical wiring (AC 110 V/60 Hz) in the home environment in Ref. [25] included an electric rice cooker that exhibited time-varying power consumption (statistically computed and used in Eq. (1) during the NILM or load disaggregation), an electric water boiler, a steamer, and a TV. ZigBee communication-equipped smart plugs or power meters were installed as the benchmark in Ref. [25]. Fig. 6 shows that composite electrical-load consumption P(t) and Q(t) in Eq. (1) was acquired by a single minimal set of current and voltage sensors at the main electric panel with an NI™ 9225 DAQ device. Where, 1) an active current transformer, a PROVA-15 AC/DC mA current probe, that generates its output voltage that is proportional to its input current was connected to the DAQ device and 2) the AC 110-V/60-Hz power source was directly wired to the DAQ device. The raw current and voltage signals were simultaneously and continuously conditioned, buffered, and then digitized, and the sampling frequency of the DAQ was set to 2 kHz. The harmonics related to THD can be extracted from the digitized current and voltage signals and be solved for the multi-objective combinatorial optimization in the NILM. The DAQ passed the digitized analyzable signals every second to a laptop via USB. The HEMS as a benchmark continually communicates with the intrusively installed ZigBee communication-equipped smart plugs or power meters in the wireless communication network to intrusively identify the electrical-load consumption as the ground truth. A MySQL® database was configured on the laptop to store the composite and appliance-level electrical-load consumption. More than 10 major electrical home appliances that need to be monitored with single or multiple state transitions in a typical residential environment exist [50]. The total number of load combinations of the monitored electrical appliances increases exponentially. In the present study, the complexity of the load disaggregation, which is considered as combinatorial optimization by evolutionary computing, is exponential in the number of monitored electrical appliances, i.e., O (T∙2(N+N')). Here, N is the number of monitored electrical appliances with a single or multiple state transitions considered as N\u2032 electrical appliances with their single state transition, and T time slices are considered. In this experiment, the total number, i.e., N (←N + N\u2032), of electrical home appliances monitored by the IoT service-oriented HEMS with the novel NILM approach is four. Thus, 16 (2 N ) load combinations are inferred by the trainingless multi-objective GA-based NILM. The load combinations include scenarios in which electrical home appliances are simultaneously turned ON or OFF. Additionally, four load combinations or scenarios are excluded because the major electrical home appliances that consume large power should not operate at the same time t to prevent overloading of the electrical wiring in the home environment. The HEMS benchmark in Ref. [25] intrusively identified the electrical home appliances, whereas the proposed NILM nonintrusively identifies the appliances. In this experiment, for each load combination, 80 voltage and current measurements were made offline. In total, 960 data instances were collected. The trainingless multi-objective GA-based NILM is applied to each of the 960 data instances to optimize Eq. (1) without exceeding the maximum ampacity of the circuit breakers in L1 of the electrical wiring in the home environment during the GA evolution. P base , Q base , P i , and Q i in Eq. (1) are measured in the home environment and statistically computed, as listed in Table 1 . In Eq. (1), α(= α 1 = α 2) is 0.005, and w 1 and w 2 are both 0.5. Fig. 7 shows the feature space composed of P and Q. The employed GA parameters are described as follows. The total length of encoded chromosomes is four. The chromosomes in the initial population (generation 0) are randomly generated. The population size is 10. The maximum number of generations or iterations is 50. The roulette-wheel selection used in this demonstration chooses the chromosomes by simulating a roulette wheel in which the area of the section in the wheel corresponds to an individual or chromosome and is proportional to the individual's expectation. Each time the roulette-wheel selection process is performed; a random number generated from a uniform distribution is used to target one of the sections in the wheel with cumulative probabilities from the individuals or chromosomes. In addition, proportional fitness scaling is used, which converts the raw fitness values returned from the fitness evaluation and produces scaled fitness values created for individuals or chromosomes that are proportional to their raw fitness values and thus are suitable for fitness proportionate selection such as the roulette-wheel selection. For simplicity, the crossover and mutation probabilities are held constant at 0.35 and 0.05, respectively. Finally, one-cut-point crossover and bitwise flipping mutation operators are used. Fig. 8 shows the GA evolution. The obtained fitness value is 0.84. The GA that must be quantitatively evaluated for its performance in terms of convergence and computational efficiency is run for 20 trials. Its mean and standard deviation are 0.858 and 0.063, respectively, and the average elapsed time is 0.023 s. The GA evolution that is quantitatively evaluated in the 20 trials is shown in Fig. 9 . Table 2 lists the load-identification rates obtained by the trainingless multi-objective GA-based NILM. It also shows a comparative analysis in which the trainingless multi-objective GA-based NILM approach is used to solve Eq. (1) with or without considering supplementary electrical feature Q. Usually, electrical appliances consume much more P than Q. w 1 and w 2 in Eq. (1) are set to 0.6 and 0.4, respectively. An experiment is also performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, as listed in Table 3 , which shows a comparative analysis where the trainingless multi-objective GA-based NILM approach is used to solve Eq. (1) with or without considering Q and the two objective functions f 1 and f 2 in Eq. (1) are not equally weighted. The list in Table 3 indicates that the trainingless multi-objective GA-based NILM approach is feasible that the NILM or load disaggregation is defined in Eq. (1) as a multi-objective combinatorial optimization problem. The load-identification rates are also improved because Q, which is considered together with P in Eq. (1), reduces the ambiguity of the electrical home appliances or load combinations with similar P values for the NILM or load disaggregation. This study focuses on the NILM or load disaggregation based on P and Q as a multi-objective combinatorial optimization problem in which the fitness function, i.e., Eq. (1), which is solved by meta-heuristics, is presented in a weighted-sum form where P and Q in the electrical wiring represent a composition or superposition of the appliance-level P and Q from the monitored electrical appliances. Although combinatorial optimization has been performed to address the NILM or load disaggregation and has been included in the open-source NILM Toolkit in Ref. [50], only P was considered during the NILM or load disaggregation. In the present study, NILM is considered as a multi-objective combinatorial optimization problem that is solved by a GA. The choice of meta-heuristics, such as the evolutionary computing and swarm intelligence, used in the NILM is not the main contribution of this work. The experimental results confirm that the proposed trainingless multi-objective GA-based NILM approach is feasible. The proposed NILM can estimate the electric-power consumption, Kilowatt-hour (kWh), of electrical appliance i at each hour h based on [ ( P i − P b a s e ) · ∑ t ∈ [ 1 + 60 ( h − 1 ) , 60 + 60 ( h − 1 ) ] x i ( t ) ] / ( 1,000 · 60 ) at a 1-min time resolution of t with respect to a measure of the composite energy consumption at time slice t in the field of interest. x i (t) is deduced through the multi-objective combinatorial optimization (the times in minutes used by electrical appliance i per hour are identified by the NILM). P i , which is defined in Section 2.1 and used in Eq. (1), is statistically computed in which the mutually exclusive operational electrical appliances are considered for, measured onsite with, and averaged from their consumed real power. A load scheduler can be developed and used to schedule electrical appliance i based on [ ( P i − P b a s e ) ⋅ ∑ t ∈ [ 1 + 60 ( h − 1 ) , 60 + 60 ( h − 1 ) ] x i ( t ) ] / ( 1,000 ⋅ 60 ) with its past trends (x i (t)) in response to DR schemes, such as Time-of-Use pricing and day-ahead real-time pricing. A short-term load forecaster can also be developed in which daily kWh usage of electrical appliance i identified by the NILM can be further estimated. 4 Conclusions and future work Smart-grid technology has flourished in recent years. NILM, which is a promising load-disaggregation technique and part of EMS for DSM in smart grids, has attracted widespread attention. In contrast to the HEMS that intrusively identifies electrical appliances using an intrusive deployment of smart plugs or power meters for electrical-energy management, NILM, which is promising and cost effective, nonintrusively identifies electrical appliances without the intrusive deployment of smart plugs or power meters. This paper has proposed a smart IoT service-oriented HEMS founded on a novel trainingless multi-objective GA-based NILM approach, which has been experimentally validated as a proof-of-concept demonstration of a trainingless fully-nonintrusive alternative in a single real residential environment for DSM. The proposed NILM is considered as a multi-objective combinatorial optimization problem solved by a GA. The GA, a population-based meta-heuristics algorithm that can be applied to both discrete- and continuous-variable engineering optimization problems, is chosen for a proof-of-concept demonstration of the proposed NILM approach. The experimental results show that the novel trainingless multi-objective GA-based NILM approach is feasible. In the future, more electrical features such as THD from current harmonics extracted from the monitored electrical appliances, which are expressed in Eq. (1) and evaluated through meta-heuristics, will be investigated for NILM or load disaggregation. Additionally, a promising future research direction can be proposed using the nondominated sorting GA II [51], which is implemented for multi-objective optimization and used in NILM to solve Eq. (1). Where a set of non-dominated solutions for multi-objective optimization can be obtained by simple execution of the algorithm without needing to determine the weights (without a rerun of the algorithm with new or different weights). Moreover, the NILM will implement active and semi-supervised learning to identify unknown or unseen electrical appliances. Active learning, which is developed with semi-supervised learning in the NILM, can be adopted in scenarios in which labeled data or electrical appliances are difficult, time-consuming, and expensive to be obtained. Finally, the NILM will be investigated with parallel Graphics Processing Units, which is accelerated for evolutionary computing and compared against ANN- or deep NN-based NILM approaches that were applied on open data such as REDD [52\u201354], which contains several weeks of power data from six different homes where only P is available, UK-DALE [55,56], which records power data from five houses, and DRED [57]. These sources will be used because the performance of the NILM in terms of convergence and computational efficiency will decrease if an increasing number of electrical appliances are monitored over fog-cloud computing [29] across multiple real residential environments. The complexity of the NILM described in Section 3 is expressed as O (T∙2(N+N')).

        "dc:description": "Electricity is the most widely used form of energy in modern society. One method of satisfying the continuously increasing industrial, commercial, and residential electrical-energy demands of consumers in smart grids is to use an Internet-of-things (IoT) service-oriented electrical-energy management system (EMS) to intrusively monitor and manage electrical loads, which can effectively react to demand-response schemes for demand-side management (DSM). Nonintrusive load monitoring (NILM), a viable cost-effective load disaggregation technique, has recently gained considerable attention as a nonintrusive alternative to EMS in the research field of smart grids. This paper presents a smart IoT-oriented home EMS founded on trainingless multi-objective evolutionary computing-based NILM for DSM in a smart grid. Evolutionary computing-based NILM is considered and addressed as a multi-objective combinatorial optimization problem. The proposed NILM technique can determine the electrical appliances based on their individual electrical characteristics extracted from composite electrical-load consumption with no intrusive deployment of smart plugs or power meters. A fully nonintrusive NILM alternative is considered and proposed. In addition, this alternative is different from conventional NILM because conventional NILM considers artificial intelligence including artificial neural networks (NNs) and deep NN as load classifiers of NILM where training and retraining stages and a hyperparameter tuning procedure are required. The proposed smart IoT-oriented home EMS was experimentally investigated with the trainingless multi-objective evolutionary computing-based NILM in a real house environment. The experimental results confirm that the proposed methodology is feasible.",
