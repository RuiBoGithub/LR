School of Civil Engineering and Architecture Southwest University of Science and Technology Mianyang 621010 China Convection-radiation combined cooling systems are commonly used in residential buildings in hot summer and cold winter areas because of their high thermal comfort. When this system is used in office buildings, combined with the characteristics of office building\u2019s working time occupancy patterns and building typologies, the operation strategy can lead to different energy consumption under the same thermal comfort. In this study, three operation strategies are compared to a system that combines two different terminal units in the same thermal zone: a radiant floor and fan coil. The performance of the combined system is assessed in terms of the thermal comfort level, hourly refrigeration performance coefficient, and energy consumption. The results indicate that the system with an intermittent operation strategy reduces energy consumption by approximately 39% compared with a continuous operation strategy, with little impact on thermal comfort. The room temperature under the three control strategies meets the temperature requirements of the office building during working hours. The fluctuation in room temperature is smaller under the continuous operation strategy than under the intermittent operation strategy, which indicates that the thermal environment of the room has better stability during continuous operation. The maximum indoor vertical gradient is always less than 3 °C, which meets the ASHRAE55-2017 standard. The room-temperature fluctuations are strongly affected by solar radiation. Therefore, building shading measures should be considered in building designs to avoid local discomfort or energy waste. When the system operates stably, the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) value is low. The reason for this is that the radiant cooling system reduces the average radiant temperature of the building to adjust the room temperature. Therefore, it is recommended that the indoor design temperature of the radiant cooling system be increased by 2\u20133 °C to ensure better indoor comfort. Keywords Operation strategy Convection-radiation combined cooling system Office building 1 Introduction Radiant air-conditioning is concerned and applied by people because of its high thermal comfort, reduced energy consumption, space saving, quiet operation, and so on [1\u20133]. Thus, there have been numerous studies on radiant air-conditioning systems for practical applications [4\u20137]. Rhee et al. [8,9] summarized the theoretical basis and application research of radiant air-conditioning systems over the past 50 years. It is shown that the radiant air-conditioning system has been continuously developed, modified and improved to achieve better thermal comfort and energy efficiency. However, the radiant air-conditioning system still has limitations such as long response time, higher capital cost and cooling load, and so on. When the radiant air-conditioning system is used in the office building, considering the office building\u2019s occupancy patterns that the air-conditioning is only needed for working time, the problem of long response time of the radiant air-conditioning system can be solved by optimizing the operation strategy. Hu et al. [10\u201313] reported that radiant cooling systems have a longer response time than convective cooling systems. Based on the thermal inertia and energy storage of the building structure, they proposed an intermittent operation strategy for a radiant cooling system to improve the energy efficiency of the cooling system. Zhang et al. [14] proposed an intermittent operation strategy for office buildings that could reduce energy consumption while maintaining the indoor comfort of the building. Lehmann et al. [15] used a pulse operation strategy to implement intermittent control of an air conditioning system for an actual typical office building as a simulation case, which reduced 50% energy consumption of the circulating pump. Hu et al. [16] analyzed the different operating strategies of a radiant cooling system using on-site measurements and numerical simulation, and found that the energy consumption and cost can be reduced with a proper operating strategy. Joe et al. [17,18] reduced the cost by 34% and 16% by proposed an intelligent operation strategy based on model predictive control. These results show that proper operation strategies can save energy consumption and avoid the long response time of radiant air-conditioning systems in office buildings. Compared with the radiant air-conditioning system, the convective air-conditioning system has a short response time and can quickly adjust the room temperature. Combining the advantages of radiant and convective air-conditioning, the convection-radiation combined cooling system was developed. Similar to the radiant air-conditioning system, the operating strategy plays an important role in the performance of the convection-radiation combined cooling system. According to Khan et al. [19,20] study of the characteristics of cooling terminals and operating strategies, the convection-radiation combined cooling system could not only ensure indoor comfort, but also have huge potential in terms of reducing energy consumption during intermittent operation. Currently, the convection-radiation combined cooling system is gradually being used in hot summer and cold winter regions of China [21], where the temperature difference between day and night can reach more than 15 ℃. In order to analyze the impact of different operation strategies of convective radiation combined cooling system on the energy consumption and thermal comfort of office buildings in the region, this paper selected a typical office building in Mianyang and installed a convection-radiation combined cooling system in it to study the energy consumption and comfort characters under different operation strategies. The relevant parameters under different operation strategies were measured, and the operation characteristics and cooling effect were analyzed, providing a reference and experimental basis for further research and the promotion of intermittent operation strategies. 2 Description of the experiment 2.1 Description of the laboratory Affected by the climate conditions of hot summer and cold winter in hot summer and cold winter areas of China [22], the typical buildings in this region always have characteristics of large window-wall ratio, high wall thermal conductivity and poor thermal stability. The test room is located on the fifth floor of a typical office building in Mianyang (located in hot summer and cold winter areas of China). The building has a total of 6 storeys, with 48 offices of the same type on each storey. The test room is on the 5th floor of this building, and has a building area of 60.34 m2 and a floor-to-ceiling height of 2.7 m. The exterior wall structure of the building is a 250-mm thick aerated concrete wall with cement mortar applied on both sides. The interior wall is a 160-mm thick reinforced concrete slab wall. There is an aluminum alloy double-glazed window with an area of 19.3 m2 on the west outer wall. The floor plan and the photo of the test room and building is illustrated in Fig. 1 . The double-loop layout wet burying method is adopted for the floor buried pipe. A PE-RT pipe with a diameter of DN 12 mm and coil spacing of 50 mm is used for the buried pipe. The floor decoration material is a ceramic tile surface, and its floor structure is shown in Fig. 2 . Anemometers and temperature and humidity sensors are installed indoors to measure the indoor comfort and vertical temperature distribution. K-type thermocouples are installed on the surface of the wall and at different indoor locations for temperature measurement (Fig. 4). All measurement data are automatically transmitted to the computer via the RS-485 interface. 2.2 Description of the system The principle of the convective radiation terminal combined cooling system is illustrated in Fig. 3 . The system consists of a cold source, convective terminal, radiant terminal, and hydraulic transmission and distribution system. The cold source is a household air source heat pump unit (YVAG012RSE). This machine has a rated cooling capacity of 11.2 kW, cooling input power of 3.8 kW, and rated cooling energy efficiency ratio of 2.95. The fan coil is TBFL-56, and its rated cooling capacity is 5.6 kW. To measure the cooling capacity of the system, a turbine flow meter (LWYD-RS485, DN32), temperature sensor (TH10S-B, DN32), and electronic electric energy meter (DTS634, 60A) are installed on the pipeline. All test data are connected to a self-developed indoor monitoring software through the RS485 bus (Fig. 5 ). In the cooling season, the refrigerant prepared by the air source heat pump flows into the convection terminal and then flows into the radiant terminal after mixing by the water mixing center. The floor coil is used for radiant cooling, whereas the fan coil is used for convection. The refrigerant flow of the floor coil is controlled by a manifold with a regulating valve, while the flow of the fan coil is controlled by an electromagnetic three-way valve. The control of the system is mainly achieved by setting the indoor operating temperature. The unit stops or runs at a low frequency when the indoor operating temperature is lower than the set value. The unit restarts when the indoor operating temperature is higher than the set value. At the initial operation stage of the system, the fan coil and floor coil simultaneously provide cooling. As the average radiant temperature gradually decreases, the fan coil bears more cooling load. At the stable operation stage of the system, the fan coil and floor coil bear the indoor cooling load simultaneously. However, the fan coil stops running, and the floor coil provides the cooling capacity to maintain a stable indoor temperature when the outdoor temperature is low. 3 Measurement scheme and data processing 3.1 Measurement scheme The experiment was conducted in August, which has a representative summer climate in Mianyang City. During the test, the outdoor temperature difference between day and night was 23\u201340 °C, and the weather was moderate solar radiation or partly cloudy. This typical climate feature also provides conditions for intermittent operation, especially in office buildings used during the day. The measurement scheme and terminal-opening instructions are listed in Table 1 . The room temperature was set to 24 °C, and the fan coil unit was operated at a low wind speed during the experiment. The minimum outlet water temperature at the radiation terminal was set to 19 °C. The water supply temperature of the air source heat pump was set to 7 °C, and the return water temperature was set to 12 °C. Two people normally worked during the experiment. 3.2 Data processing 1. Analysis of the temperature The sample standard deviation is introduced to evaluate the stability of the indoor thermal environment to characterize the temperature fluctuations. The calculation formula is shown in Eq. (1). A large sample standard deviation value implies that the room temperature fluctuates greatly, indicating that the indoor thermal environment has poor stability. A small value of the sample standard deviation indicates that the room temperature fluctuation is small, indicating that the indoor thermal environment is stable.

Analysis of the thermal comfort The predicted mean vote (PMV) and predicted percentage of dissatisfied (PPD) are used in the international standard ISO 7730 to describe and evaluate the thermal comfort of the environment. The PMV is the average thermal sensation index, which is an evaluation index that characterizes the thermal response of the human body. The PPD is the average value of votes that are expected to be dissatisfied with the thermal environment. This indicator was used by Professor Fanger to collect data and quantify human comfort using regression formulas. Quantitative indicators based on the data are proposed, as shown in Table 2 . The recommended index value in the international standard ISO 7730 is − − 0.5 ≤ PMV≤+0.5, PPD ≤ 10%. 3. Analysis of the system operation status To evaluate the cooling capacity and operation status of the cooling system, the cooling capacity of the system was estimated to calculate the cooling load borne by different terminals. The operation of the cooling system during all stages of the day was analyzed according to the cooling load capacity. The cooling capacity of the system can be calculated based on the temperature difference between the inlet and outlet water, as defined in Eq. (2). (2) Q = C ρ V k ( T k - T k \u2032 ) Q \u2014\u2014Cooling capacity of the system, J C \u2014\u2014Specific heat capacity of water, C = 4.2 × 103 J/ (kg·℃) ρ \u2014\u2014Density of water, 1000 kg/m3 V k \u2014\u2014Water flow of the ASHP for one round of data transmission, m3 T k \u2014\u2014ASHP water supply temperature for data recording, ℃ T k \u2032 \u2014\u2014ASHP water return temperature for data recording, The refrigeration performance coefficient EER is introduced to characterize the energy efficiency of the cooling system during operation. It represents the cooling capacity per unit power of the cooling system. A large value of the refrigeration performance coefficient indicates that the energy consumption of the cooling system is small, which indicates that the system is economical. However, owing to the start and stop operations of the air source heat pump during the experiment, the refrigeration performance coefficient cannot accurately represent the operating status of the system. Therefore, the hourly refrigeration performance coefficient is used to characterize its performance by referring to the calculation method of the refrigeration performance coefficient. The corresponding formula is shown in Eq. (3). (3) EE R h = C ρ ∑ k n V k ( T k - T k \u2032 ) 3.6 × 10 6 W h where: EERh\u2014\u2014Hourly refrigeration performance coefficient Wh\u2014\u2014Hourly electricity of the cooling system 4 Analysis and discussion Experimental data with similar outdoor meteorological conditions were selected for sorting. The curves of the outdoor temperature (TO), room temperature (TR), floor temperature (TF), dew point temperature (TD), PMV value, system energy consumption, and hourly coefficient of refrigeration performance with time under different operation strategies were obtained. The PMV-PPD theory was introduced to evaluate the indoor thermal comfort, and the sample standard deviation was used to evaluate the stability of the indoor thermal environment. The hourly refrigeration performance coefficient and system energy consumption were used to analyze the operation status and energy consumption of the system. The main results of the analysis are summarized in the following subsections. 4.1 Analysis of the temperature Fig. 6 (a), (b), and (c) show the time-varying relationships of the outdoor temperature (TO), room temperature (TR), floor temperature (TF), and dew point temperature (TD) under different strategies. It can be seen from the figures that the typical outdoor temperature in Mianyang fluctuates between 20 and 40 °C, and the average outdoor temperature during working hours (9:00 to 18:00) is 31.92 °C, 32.16 °C, and 32.35 °C. The room temperature fluctuates between 22 and 30 °C after the cooling system is turned on. The average room temperature is 24.07 °C, 25.52 °C, and 26.61 °C during working hours, which basically meets the room temperature requirements of office buildings during working hours. The sample standard deviations of the room temperature are 0.98, 1.29, and 1.81 °C, respectively. This shows that the fluctuation range of room temperature during continuous operation is smaller than that during intermittent operation, which indicates that the room environment has good thermal stability during continuous operation. Because the test room has windows in the west, the room temperature tends to increase significantly from 12:00 to 18:00 every day. Comparing the maximum room temperature occurrence time of continuous operation and intermittent operation, it was found that the maximum room temperature of continuous operation is observed at approximately 15:00, while that of intermittent operation lags by 3 h. The reason for this phenomenon is that the building wall maintains cold storage at night during continuous operation. When the direct sun causes the load to increase, the load peak can be reduced. However, there is no cold storage on the building wall during intermittent operation, and the system cannot bear the peak load, resulting in a large increase in the room temperature. It can also be seen from Fig. 8(a), (b), and (c) that the average indoor radiation temperature fluctuates at 24 °C during continuous operation, while it fluctuates at 25.5 °C during intermittent operation. At the same time, it was found that the cold storage on the walls of the building at night offset part of the heat load of the building during the day, thereby improving the stability of the indoor thermal environment. 4.2 Analysis of the vertical temperature difference Fig. 7 (a), (b), and (c) show the temperature change curves with time for the measuring points 450 mm, 1350 mm, and 2250 mm from the ground under different operating strategies. It can be seen from the figures that the indoor vertical temperature fluctuates between 21 and 30 °C under different operation strategies, and the temperature in the occupied zone (1350 mm from the ground) fluctuates between 22 and 28 °C. The trend of the room temperature change is similar under the same operating strategy, and the room temperature is evenly distributed. Under the continuous operation strategy, the maximum temperature difference of the indoor measuring points is approximately 1 °C, while under the intermittent operation strategy, it is 3\u20134 °C. The reason for this phenomenon is that the temperature of each point in the room is affected by the average radiation temperature of the building and solar radiation. Fig. 6(d) shows the relationship between the average temperature of the room-temperature measurement points and the vertical height under different operation strategies. It can be seen from the figure that the lower part of the room temperature field is cold while the upper part is hot, and the temperature gradient in the area above 1.8 m in the room is slightly larger. The maximum vertical temperature difference under the continuous operation strategy is 1.6 °C, while that under the intermittent operation strategy is approximately 2.8 °C. According to the ASHRAE55-2017 standard, the maximum temperature gradient of the human activity area (0.1\u20131.1 m) should not exceed 3 °C, and all operating strategies meet the requirements. It can be seen from the figure that the temperature of measuring point C is always higher than that of the other measuring points in the room owing to the influence of solar radiation, which indicates that solar radiation has a significant influence on the room temperature. Therefore, building shading measures should be fully considered in building designs to avoid discomfort or energy waste caused by indoor local high temperatures. 4.3 Analysis of the thermal comfort Fig. 8 shows the relationship of the PMV value with time under different operating strategies. It can be seen from the figure that when the system is running continuously, the PMV value fluctuates between − 1.42 and − 0.09, with an average value of − 0.66. The PMV value of intermittent operation (uninterrupted) fluctuates between − 0.82 and 0.51, with an average value of − 0.25. The PMV value of intermittent operation (interrupted) fluctuates between − 0.81 and 1.05, with an average value of 0.07. The average value of the PMV during intermittent operation meets the recommended value of the ISO7730 standard. Although the PMV under continuous operation is slightly lower than the recommended value, the comfort level is still acceptable. The reason for this phenomenon is that the radiant cooling system reduces the average radiant temperature of the building to adjust the room temperature. This can also be seen from Fig. 6(a), (b), and (c) that the floor temperature is basically 20 °C under the continuous operation strategy, while it fluctuates between 20 and 25 °C under the intermittent operation strategy. Therefore, it is recommended that the indoor design temperature of the radiant cooling system be increased by 2\u20133 °C to ensure better indoor comfort and improve energy-saving effects. It can also be seen from the figure that as the sun shines directly on the western building envelope in the afternoon, the cooling capacity of the system is insufficient, resulting in a decrease in the indoor comfort of the building. However, when the outdoor temperature is low at night or in the morning, a feeling of coldness is experienced indoors. The reason for this phenomenon is that the system sets a fixed wind speed of the fan, which cannot be adjusted according to the actual cooling load. Therefore, to ensure better thermal comfort in the building, it is recommended to adjust the cooling system in real time according to changes in the outdoor temperature. 4.4 Analysis of the energy efficiency and energy consumption Fig. 9 (a), (b), and (c) show the relationship between the hourly refrigeration performance coefficient and system energy consumption with time under different operating strategies. It can be seen from the figures that the hourly refrigeration performance coefficient fluctuates between 0.59 and 3.16 when the system is running continuously, and the average hourly refrigeration performance coefficient is 1.57, which is considerably lower than the rated refrigeration performance coefficient. However, the hourly refrigeration performance coefficient of the system fluctuates between 1.80 and 3.40 during intermittent operation, and the average hourly refrigeration performance coefficient is approximately 2.55, which is basically the same as the rated refrigeration performance coefficient. The reason for this phenomenon is that the unit is in low-frequency operation for a long time after the room temperature reaches the set value under the continuous operation strategy, while the unit is in high-efficiency operation during intermittent operation. This can also be seen from Fig. 10 (a), (b), and (c), when the system is running continuously at night, only the radiation terminal is used for cooling, and the unit is in low-frequency operation. Comparing the energy consumption of the convective and radiation/radiant terminals in the three modes, the energy consumption ratio of the radiation terminal is approximately 48\u201357%, which is reduced by the interruption times. However, during intermittent operation, the convection and radiation combined terminal supplies cooling simultaneously, and the system operates efficiently. Therefore, to ensure that the cooling system operates efficiently, it is recommended to shut down the system when the outdoor temperature is low. It can also be seen from Fig. 9 that the average daily energy consumption of the system under continuous operation is 30.1 kW∙h, and that under intermittent operation (uninterrupted and interrupted) is 18.4 kW∙h and 18.1 kW∙h, respectively. The calculation shows that intermittent operation reduces energy consumption by approximately 39% compared with continuous operation, and the energy consumption of the two intermittent operation strategies is almost the same. The cooling capacity provided by the system fluctuates between 10 and 120 W/m2. In the initial operation stage of the system, the radiant floor system bears a higher cooling load. As the room temperature decreases, the fan coil gradually bears a higher cooling load. The reason for this phenomenon is the large difference between the temperature of the supply water at the radiation terminal and the room temperature in the initial operation stage, resulting in a high heat exchange efficiency. Therefore, to ensure indoor thermal comfort, and achieve efficient operation of the system and reduce its energy consumption, it is recommended to adopt an intermittent operation strategy. 5 Conclusions In this study, we built and tested a convective radiation terminal combined cooling system for a typical office building. The effects of different operation strategies on the room temperature, vertical temperature difference, thermal comfort, and refrigeration performance coefficient, and system energy consumption of the cooling system were analyzed. The conclusions of this study are as follows. 1. The intermittent operation strategy can meet the cooling requirements of office buildings during working hours. However, the fluctuation range of room temperature during continuous operation is smaller than that during intermittent operation, which indicates that the indoor thermal stability of the building is better during continuous operation. 2. To ensure better thermal comfort and improve energy-saving effects, it is recommended that the indoor design temperature of the radiant cooling system be increased by 2\u20133 °C, and the cooling system is adjusted in real time according to the change in the outdoor temperature. 3. Intermittent operations reduce energy consumption by approximately 39% compared with continuous operation with the same indoor thermal comfort. Therefore, it is recommended to adopt an intermittent operation strategy to reduce the energy consumption.

When this system is used in office buildings, combined with the characteristics of office building\u2019s working time occupancy patterns and building typologies, the operation strategy can lead to different energy consumption under the same thermal comfort. In this study, three operation strategies are compared to a system that combines two different terminal units in the same thermal zone: a radiant floor and fan coil. The performance of the combined system is assessed in terms of the thermal comfort level, hourly refrigeration performance coefficient, and energy consumption. The results indicate that the system with an intermittent operation strategy reduces energy consumption by approximately 39% compared with a continuous operation strategy, with little impact on thermal comfort. The room temperature under the three control strategies meets the temperature requirements of the office building during working hours. The fluctuation in room temperature is smaller under the continuous operation strategy than under the intermittent operation strategy, which indicates that the thermal environment of the room has better stability during continuous operation. The maximum indoor vertical gradient is always less than 3 °C, which meets the ASHRAE55-2017 standard. The room-temperature fluctuations are strongly affected by solar radiation. Therefore, building shading measures should be considered in building designs to avoid local discomfort or energy waste. When the system operates stably, the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) value is low. The reason for this is that the radiant cooling system reduces the average radiant temperature of the building to adjust the room temperature. Therefore, it is recommended that the indoor design temperature of the radiant cooling system be increased by 2\u20133 °C to ensure better indoor comfort.",
