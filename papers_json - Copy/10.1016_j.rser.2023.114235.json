Advancements in Internet of Energy (IoE) technologies drive the development of several energy efficient frameworks for better energy optimization, economic savings, safety, and security in smart homes. However, certain challenges such as real-time operational data for each micro-moment, proper application of data fusion techniques, and end-to-end computing and deployment architecture prevent the establishment of an effective energy-efficient framework to provide personalized energy-saving recommendations. This work presents energy management for smart spaces (EMSS), the proposed energy efficiency framework implemented in an edge-cloud computing platform that fuses data from heterogeneous data sources (environmental sensors, camera, plug data, etc.) at appropriate data fusion levels and process them to generate actionable, explainable, personalized, and persuasive recommendations at the right moment. The user response to the generated recommendations triggers the actuators to perform respective energy-saving actions and provide more personalized future recommendations. Further, SMARTHome - a data generation framework based on configurable scenario files and a set of software codes was proposed to generate synthetic data with respect to different building types and micro-moments. The functionalities of the EMSS (device and user registration), user dashboard, analytics, and energy-saving recommendations were made accessible to the user through web and mobile applications. The validation analysis of the EMSS was performed by (i) comparative analysis of the machine learning and deep learning algorithms used by the decision engine to generate energy-saving recommendations and (ii) benchmarking of EMSS based on the taxonomy of data fusion-based energy efficiency frameworks for smart homes.

In particular, buildings in urban areas consume more than 40 % of the overall energy demand and account for more than 50 % of the associated carbon emissions [3]. The energy consumption of the building sector is expected to rise by 1.3 % per year on average in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries and more than 2 % per year on average for non-OECD from 2018 to 2050 [4]. Further, unexpected circumstances like COVID-19 pandemic (social distancing measures, e-learning, remote working, etc) have temporarily shifted the energy demand from commercial buildings to residential areas which has led to increased usage, billing, and economic impact on residential customers [5]. Buildings as the primary energy consumers and contributor of carbon emissions, it is highly significant to look out for strategies and technologies to reduce energy consumption and enhance the performance of the buildings thereby achieving the long-term goals on energy efficiency, environmental and climate change [6]. Recent research and development initiatives focus on the design of (i) nearly zero energy buildings (nZEBs): employs energy management systems, sustainable and renewable energy sources, and (ii) energy-saving smart Internet of Energy (IoE) technologies: uses Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence, big data analytics, edge/cloud computing platform, and behavioural analytics [7]. Due to the practical implications in developing nZEBs such as high deployment cost and challenges in applying to conventional buildings, innovative energy-saving solutions based on IoE are preferred and adopted by the energy providers, end-users, and policymakers to progress towards energy savings, energy security, and carbon reduction in building sectors [8]. Smart IoE technologies have significant role in the design of a powerful energy efficiency ecosystem for remote acquisition and control, i.e., collecting data on indoor and outdoor ambient conditions, appliance energy consumption, end-user habits/activities, and preferences [9]. About 20 % energy savings can be achieved by tailoring different energy-efficient measures targeting the end-user behaviour thereby, helping them to understand their energy consumption patterns and improve their consumption behaviour [10]. Energy efficiency frameworks based on behavioural change involve analyzing the energy consumption footprints and associated contextual information to provide the end-users with tailored recommendations on optimizing their energy usage to achieve greater economic and ecological benefits. Several energy efficiency ecosystems based on end-user behavioural change have been designed using information and communication technologies (ICT) such as IoT technologies, smart sensors, smart meters, big data analytics (data aggregation and data fusion), artificial intelligence techniques, and edge/cloud computing platform to provide personalized energy-saving recommendations to the end-users. The identification of common energy consumption activities in a household (cooking, sleeping, relaxing, bathing, and working on computers), user interests, and associated costs help to investigate the impact of energy behaviour of the user on domestic energy consumption. To achieve the same, recent studies use the concept of micro-moments, which is the energy consumption behaviour of the user throughout the day at different time intervals [11]. For example, the user performs cooking activity between 12:00 p.m. to 1:00 p.m., during which electrical appliances like microwave oven, kettle, exhaust chimneys, mixer grinder, blender, and dishwasher are active and consume about 20 kWh. These micro-moments provide rich contextual information on energy consumption and are usually coupled with environmental data (temperature, humidity, occupancy, and luminosity). Table 1 presents a detailed analysis of the recent advancements in energy efficiency framework for smart homes. Though there has been a significant progress in the development of energy efficiency framework for smart home, the major challenges that prevents the establishment of an effective ones are mostly related to, (i) benchmark datasets: unavailability of open access repositories containing existing datasets collected for different building types with respect to various energy-saving scenarios and user micro-moments, (ii) real time operational data: it is difficult to obtain real time data with respect to the building type and user-specific activities for different energy optimization scenarios; smaller set of user actions/ratings (accept/reject/no response) for the generated recommendations (data sparseness) and lack of user actions for new recommendations (cold start problem) results in unreliable recommendations and user dissatisfaction, (iii) data formats: inability to handle structured (numeric data from sensors) and unstructured data (image and audio data from camera and noise sensors) (iv) data fusion: ignoring its broader scope to generate meaningful recommendations, it is mostly used to handle the uncertainty in the data measurements and improve the quality of the extracted information, (v) third party frameworks: integration of the energy efficiency framework with third party recommendation system, analytics, and visualization platform, (vi) validation of the energy efficiency framework: due to the unavailability of the benchmark datasets and evaluation toolkits, it has been difficult to validate the new energy efficiency framework designed for smart spaces. Fusion-based recommender frameworks adopting data fusion and sub-recommendation fusion schemes (item fusion method [12], multi-modal fusion [13], multi-level fusion [14], matrix factorization [15], joint-representation learning paradigm [16]) have gained popularity to provide end-users with timely and personalized energy-saving recommendations. However, such systems use a batch training process that ignores the dynamics in the user preferences, an important aspect in the real-time deployment of the recommender system. To summarize, this work focuses on the development of an efficient recommendation platform that consciously fuses the environment, energy consumption, user feedback, and user habit data to generate actionable, explainable, personalized, and persuasive recommendations at the right moment. To overcome the challenges in the state-of-the-art energy efficiency frameworks for smart homes this work presents energy management for smart spaces (EMSS), an end-to-end energy efficiency framework for smart spaces. The novelty and contributions of the presented work are highlighted as. 1. EMSS: An end-to-end energy efficiency framework is presented for smart spaces which comprise of (i) data acquisition and ingestion layer: collect, pre-process, and send the sensor, plug, video, image, and audio data from heterogeneous data sources through different data pipelines (sensor pipeline, video pipeline, plug pipeline, and audio pipeline) for further processing, (ii) data fusion layer: performs low-level and mid-level fusion on data from various data pipelines, (iii) decision engine layer: performs high-level fusion on the fused data and generate appropriate recommendations for each micro-moment, and (iv) data visualization layer: presents the energy consumption analytics, economic and ecological impacts, and recommendations through WebUI and MobileUI. 2. SMARTHome: A data generation framework is designed to generate synthetic dataset for different micro-moments and energy-optimization scenarios in the smart home based on a configurable scenario file and a set of software codes. 3. Multiple sensors of the same type are used to address the uncertainty and a set of data quality enhancement techniques were applied to improve the quality of the obtained data. 4. Smart data fusion approach: different levels of data fusion techniques, (i) low-level fusion: residual and probabilistic weight-based low-level fusion algorithm is applied on the data from the sensor pipeline (temperature, humidity, light, and C O 2 ) , (ii) mid-level fusion: Naives Bayes and random forest algorithms were applied on the data from video/image pipeline and sensor pipeline (motion sensor), and (iii) high-level fusion: a multivariate long short term memory (LSTM) was used to provide energy-saving recommendations for the considered energy optimization use cases. 5. Web and mobile user interfaces: present user dashboards and controls, device management, energy analytics, and energy-saving recommendations to instigate change in the energy consumption behaviour of the user. 6. The energy-saving recommendations are presented in an actionable, explainable, persuasive, and personalized manner to increase the user's trust on the EMSS and increase the acceptance rate of the generated recommendations. Recommendations provided by the EMSS explain what action need to be taken and why, the ecological, and economic benefits of each action, and personalized based on the user habits and previous recommendations. 7. An end-to-end implementation of the EMSS framework for smart homes uses Kafka, Apache Spark, dockers, MongoDB, React, and Django on edge-cloud computing infrastructure. An edge-cloud computing platform was used to handle since image/video data for occupancy-centric activities and future works on the integration of renewable energy sources to smart homes (e.g., sky camera image based solar forecasting). 8. A comparative analysis of EMSS over the recent energy efficiency framework for energy optimization in smart homes was carried out based on the taxonomy of big data fusion-based energy efficiency frameworks for smart homes [9]. Section 2 presents the EMSS energy efficiency framework for smart spaces, application of the EMSS framework, and end-to-end integration of the different components and functionalities of EMSS. Section 3 presents SMARTHome, synthetic data generation framework, data pre-processing and quality enhancement techniques, implementation details of the EMSS, web and mobile user interface, and benchmark analysis. Section 4 concludes the study with future directions. 2 Energy management for smart spaces (EMSS) framework The major objective of EMSS, a multi-sensor data fusion platform for energy optimization in smart spaces is to provide comfortable & energy-efficient living spaces and workspaces through smart recommendations for optimal appliance usage and indoor environment control. To achieve the same, EMSS employs a combination of different indoor and outdoor environmental sensors, plug-level sensors, smart meters, actuators for data acquisition, smart data fusion approaches, intelligent algorithms, and visualizations to derive energy-efficient recommendations. Fig. 1 depicts the architecture and workflow of EMSS for energy optimization in smart spaces such as homes, workspaces, industries, and commercial buildings. The architecture of EMSS consists of four primary layers and detailed functionalities of each layer are. \u2022 Data ingestion layer: In general, smart spaces are equipped with different types of sensors such as indoor and outdoor environmental sensors, smart meters, plug-level sensors, CCTV, gas, proximity, and motion sensors to sense and monitor the environment at different granularities. The data ingestion layer acquires the real-time operational data from the various sensors deployed at the considered smart spaces and feeds them into appropriate data pipelines (sensor, plug, audio, and video) for further processing. \u2022 Data fusion layer: The data from the different sensors deployed across the smart space are used as inputs to the data fusion engine. A series of data preprocessing and fusion techniques were applied to the input data fed to the data fusion engine, which results in fused data with high-level features. For example, sensor readings from the multiple temperature ( T 1 , T 2 , \u2026 , T n ) , light ( L 1 , L 2 , \u2026 , L n ) , humidity ( H 1 , H 2 , \u2026 , H n ) , and C O 2 ( C O 2 1 , C O 2 2 , \u2026 , C O 2 n ) , sensors are processed by the data fusion layer to provide the fused data, i.e., fused_temperature, fused_light, fused_humidity, and fused_ C O 2 . The data fusion layer performs (i) low-level data fusion: fuses the datapoints from multiple sensors, measuring the same variable, and (ii) mid-level data fusion: fuses data from different type of sensors at the same time to derive high-level information from the low-level fused features. 2.1 Energy optimization in smart homes 2.1.1 Sensor data The input data streams for energy optimization in smart homes are generated by the smart home simulator csv module (Refer Section 3.1). The synthetic operational data of the smart home are fed as inputs to the data fusion engine through respective data pipelines. The data streams comprise of (i) Environmental sensor data: indoor and outdoor environmental conditions of the smart home using temperature, humidity, light, C O 2 , and gas sensors, (ii) Energy consumption data: energy consumption of the appliances (TV, ACs, light, washing machine, dish washer, and microwave oven) using plug-level sensors and smart meters, and (iii) Occupancy detection data: room occupancy status using motion sensors and camera. 2.1.2 Different levels of data fusion Fig. 2 depicts the different levels of data fusion, i.e., low-level, mid-level and high-level in the data fusion platform for energy optimization in smart homes. The goal of different levels of fusion is to get the optimized temperature, humidity, and occupancy value for energy optimization. The data fusion occurs as, (i) Feed the data from the multiple temperature, humidity, motion, and camera sensors as an input to the data fusion engine through the respective data pipelines, (ii) Fuse multiple data points of the same sensor type to get the low-level fused humidity, temperature, motion, camera which is further used for mid-level fusion, (iii) Fuse the data from the motion sensor and camera to derive occupancy, and (iv) Fuse the mid-level fused features and occupancy using the high-level fusion algorithms. The low-level fusion focuses on the accurate and reliable sensing or measurement of the input data which is to be processed by various components of the data fusion platform. The input to the low-level fusion algorithm is provided by the multiple sensors deployed in the smart home to record the environment variables. In the current setup, three sensors have been deployed to sense each contextual factor in each room, however, the number of sensors can be greater or lesser than three. For example, a set of three temperature sensors ( T e m p 1 , T e m p 2 , T e m p 3 ) have been deployed in each room (living hall, room 1, room 2, and room 3) of the smart home space to record temperature values. The mean of the three sensor values for each contextual feature was calculated and used as fused sensor value. However, this method may not be the most accurate method because, \u2022 Out of three sensor values, one or more of the values could be skewed. \u2022 Conditional probability based on the past events, where one sensor is value is in specific range while the other sensor measurements are in different range. To handle such issues, the probabilistic weights of the sensor values are determined by the low-level fusion algorithm. Based on the past events, if there exist such occurrences in the historical data, the low-level fusion algorithm assigns high probabilistic weights to the sensor value even though its range is different than other two sensors. Mid-level fusion is a technique that fuses the results from the low-level fusion module to get high-level features. For example, the mid-level fusion fuses the inference from the camera (motion detection module + motion sensor data) to detect occupancy. Bernoulli Naives Bayes and random forest algorithms were used to perform mid-level fusion. It integrates information from multiple sources to gain a comprehensive understanding of the environment. It is more complex and computationally intensive when compared to the low and mid-level data fusion. The decision engine performs high-level fusion and generates alerts/recommendations based on the data collected from the sensors. This work models the problem of generating right recommendations at right moment to increase the probability of user acceptance as a time-series classification task. To achieve the same, a set of artificial intelligence techniques such as decision trees, random forest, and LSTM have been used by the decision engine to generate accurate recommendations with the low-level and mid-level fused data from the data fusion layer. For each energy optimization use case, the fused data at a given time ( T S i = ( F S t 1 , F S t 2 , \u2026 , F S t n ) ) , aggregated fused data of the previous time intervals ( T S j = ( F S t − 1 1 , F S t − 1 2 , \u2026 , F S t − 1 m ) ) and user actions on the previous recommendations generated ( T S k = ( A 1 , A 2 , \u2026 , A m ) ) are fed as inputs to the AI models. The user actions can either be \u20180\u2019 (No response), \u2018+1\u2019 (Positive response), and \u2018-1\u2019 (Negative response). The output value ( O t = f ( T S i , T S j , T S k ) ) of the model is \u20180\u2019 for \u2018No recommendation\u2019 and \u20181\u2019 for \u2018Recommendation generated at time t\u2019. 2.2 Energy optimization use cases and recommendations The fused data obtained from appropriate application of different levels of data fusion on the input data streams from various data pipelines are used as inputs by the decision engine module to generate energy-saving alerts/recommendations for each energy optimization use case. The implementation of EMSS framework for energy optimization in smart homes involves four main energy optimization use cases, namely (i) appliance level energy management, (ii) light management, (iii) AC management, and (iv) indoor air quality management. The alerts/recommendations generated by the decision engine for each room are published as events and consumed by the controller. Table 2 presents the input, output, and generated recommendations for the four energy optimization use cases. Recommendations are of two types, namely (i) instantaneous: recommendations generated at the time when an event occurs, e.g., recommendation on AC temperature set point or generating gas leak alert, and (ii) temporal: recommendations generated when an event occurs over a specified time interval. e.g., if the living room TV is ON without occupancy for over 10 min, an alert would be generated to turn OFF the TV. \u2022 Appliance-level energy management: This scenario deals with controlling the appliances such as washing machine, ACs, dishwasher, microwave oven, and TVs based on the occupancy and energy consumption data from the plug level sensors and smart meters. The outputs of the decision engine are (i) graphs and analytics: weekly consumption graph, occupancy graph of each room, occupancy vs. energy consumption, appliances with highest energy consumption, and appliance level energy consumption, and (ii) alerts/recommendations: switch ON/OFF the devices based on the occupancy, temperature, and humidity. \u2022 Light management: The decision engine processes the input data, i.e., fused feature (light, light plug data, occupancy) and generate an alert/recommendation for the user. For example, alerts to switch ON/OFF the lights based on the occupancy. Fig. 3 provides the workflow of the EMSS framework for energy optimization in smart homes. The ingestion layer comprises of sensor, plug, and video pipeline to provide necessary operational data of the smart home. The data from the different sensors deployed across the smart home are used as inputs to the data fusion engine. The data fusion layer in the data fusion block process the data from the multiple sensors (temperature ( T 1 , T 2 , \u2026 , T n ) , light ( L 1 , L 2 , \u2026 , L n ) , humidity ( H 1 , H 2 , \u2026 , H n ) , and C O 2 sensors) to provide accurate fused data (fused_temperature, fused_light, fused_humidity, and fused_ C O 2 ). The video pipeline data is fed as the input to the object detection module to detect the occupancy. The sensor data and the output of the object detection module, i.e., occupancy is fed as the input to the mid-level fusion to provide the occupancy count and status. The fused sensor data, plug load data, occupancy count and occupancy status are given as an input to the decision engine. A set of artificial intelligence models such as decision trees, random forest, and LSTM [33] are used by the decision engine for classification tasks, i.e., binary classification (0 - \u2018No recommendation at time t\u2019 and 1 \u2013 \u2018Provide recommendation at time t\u2019). The decision engine continuously trains the AI models for each user and energy optimization use case to provide energy-efficient actionable recommendations in real-time, thereby promoting energy-savings. For each energy optimization use case considered in this study, the inputs from various data pipelines are processed by the data fusion layer and decision engine layer to generate energy-saving actionable recommendations. The recommendations generated by the decision engine are (i) actionable: recommendations are based on the fused IoT data, (ii) explainable: recommendations are self-explainable to inform the user about the factors that triggered the recommendation (e.g., AC is ON without occupancy, appliances running for a longer period, and so on), and (iii) persuasive: each recommendation informs the user about the economic and ecological benefits such that it drives the user towards accepting the recommended actions, and (iv) personalized: the user actions on each recommendation is saved to learn the user behavior with respect to the contextual features and tailor the future recommendations to be context and user-sensitive. 2.3 End-to-end integration of the data fusion platform for smart homes Due to the unavailability of real time data that satisfies the data requirements of the smart home space, the concept of \u2018digital twin\u2019 is used to generate the required data using a smart home simulator. More details on the smart home simulator designed to generate synthetic data for smart homes are provided in Section 3.1. To the best of the knowledge, benchmark datasets available at various data repositories do not contain the required parameters/fields related to the environmental and appliance level aesthetics of the smart homes. Specifically, available datasets do not include the real-time operational data generated for various micro-moments in the smart homes such as cooking, sleeping, and washing. Most of the datasets were generated in a controlled real time environment for specific scenarios over a limited period, thereby limiting their usage for this study. Fig. 4 presents an end-to-end integration of the data fusion platform for smart home energy optimization. The data generated by the smart home simulator is fed into appropriate data pipelines in the message broker, namely (i) sensor pipeline: data from various sensors such as temperature, humidity, C O 2 , light, and motion are sent to the data fusion pipeline; it also contains occupancy count and occupancy derived from an SSD mobile net that is deployed on an edge device. Inferences from the accurate data provided by SSD mobile net is sent to the database through the sensor pipeline and data fusion pipeline. (ii) plug pipeline: data from the smart plugs send the energy consumption and related details to the database, and (iii) video pipeline: accurate data from SSD mobile net is sent to the YOLO v5 through the video pipeline. In certain cases, wherein the data from the SSD mobile net provides low confidence, occupancy status and count are set to NA and the image frame are sent to the YOLO v5 object detection model for further processing. The updated camera inferences (occupancy status and count) provided by the YOLO v5 model is sent the data fusion pipeline which is later stored in the database. The smart home csv simulator provides the data source for the energy-optimization use cases. The data from the sensor, video, and plug pipeline is sent through proper channels to the data fusion pipeline for further processing. The plug data is directly sent to the database, while the sensor data is sent to the data fusion pipeline for preprocessing and then stored in the database. For example, temperature, humidity, C O 2 , and light data provided by a set of three sensors are fused by the data fusion pipeline to provide F u s e d T e m p , F u s e d H u m i d i t y , F u s e d C O 2 , and F u s e d L i g h t , which is stored in the database. The inferences from the images of high confidence from the SSD MobileNet is sent to data fusion pipeline through the sensor pipeline. For the images with low confidence, video consumer streaming is sent to the YOLO v5 module for better processing. The updated inferences provided by the YOLO v5 model is sent to the data fusion pipeline. The Yolo flag sent along with the data is used for taking Yolo inferences. On completion of data processing related tasks in the data fusion pipeline, a message containing timestamp and home ID is sent to the decision engine queue. This message acts as a signal for the decision engine to further process the fused data for the given timestamp and home ID. On saving the sensor, plug and inference of the image data to the database, it is highly essential to derive temporal features and instantaneous features from the database for each message sent via. the decision engine queue. Both the temporal features and instantaneous feature are used for the inference provided by the decision engine model. Such inferences help the decision engine model to decide on whether to roll out recommendation or not for each time stamp. If the inference is to send the recommendations to the user, appropriate recommendations for each energy optimization use case is pushed to the recommendation queue and recommendation table. The user actions for each alert/recommendation along with the related sensing measurements is saved for personalized actions and controls. 3 Experimental analysis 3.1 Dataset Over a decade, related studies have explored the various dimensions of energy consumption analysis in residential spaces which has resulted in several intelligent AI models and benchmark datasets. Such benchmark datasets cannot be used to train the models designed for energy optimization in smart home as. \u2022 The exact real-time smart home environment cannot be mimicked throughout the data collection period (especially several months to years). \u2022 The nature of the appliances installed at the home and their operation schedule remains unique for each user. \u2022 Modelling the user behaviour is too complex as it is highly impacted by the environmental and psychological factors. \u2022 Data for different micro-moments or scenarios (e.g., energy consumption during different levels of occupancy, cooking, etc.) of the smart home user activity is difficult to generate. \u2022 Unavailability of the data from multiple sensors measuring the same physical entity (most basic data requirement for data fusion models). \u2022 High cost and time related factors involved in setting up the environment. This work presents SMARTHome, synthetic data generation framework designed using Python libraries to address the challenges in generating data from real-time environments and available benchmark energy consumption datasets. For this study, SMARTHome generates appliance-level energy consumption (plug load and smart meter), environmental (temperature, humidity, C O 2 , gas), and occupancy (proximity, motion and camera) related data for a smart home with three rooms (Room1, Room2, and Room3), one living hall (Hall1), one kitchen (Kitchen1), two bathrooms (Bathroom1 and Bathroom2), two sit outs (Balcony1 and Balcony2), one backyard (Backyard1), and one entrance lobby (Entrancelobby1) at per minute granularity. The scenarios for four-energy optimization use cases are, 1. Appliance-level energy optimization: (i) Room is VACANT and appliances are RUNNING and (ii) plug load data of the active appliances. 2. Light management: (i) Lights are ON and the natural outdoor lighting is sufficient and (ii) lights are ON and room is VACANT. 3. AC management: (i) AC is ON and the outdoor temperature is in the comfortable level, (ii) AC is ON and room is VACANT, and (iii) plug load data of the AC. 4. Indoor air quality management: Indoor air quality index is beyond healthy and critical levels. In addition, nature of occupancy (vacant, intermittent vacant, less vacant, and highly vacant), time at which the appliances are turned ON/OFF and related impact on the indoor environment and temporal aspects of an activity (weekday/weekend/hour of the day) need to be considered while modelling different smart home scenarios. On finalizing the smart home environment and related scenarios, generate real-time data from appropriate modules after careful consideration of number of sensor type, contextual-awareness, and activities in each room. The outdoor weather-related data is extracted from the weather APIs provided by the Government of Singapore [34]. For example, a living room consists of TV (1 No.), air conditioner (1 No.), air purifier (1 No.), temperature sensor (3 Nos.), humidity sensor (3 Nos.), light sensor (3 Nos.), motion sensor (3 Nos.), C O 2 sensor (3 Nos.), and camera (1 No.). The SMARTHome, synthetic data generation framework was designed with the modules detailed in Table 4 . More details on the modules, configurations, and access to the complete SMARTHome synthetic data generation framework is available in GitLab repository and made available on request. 3.2 Data pre-processing 3.2.1 Z-score normalization Standardization was applied to transform the features in the synthetic dataset such that their mean is \u2018zero\u2019 and standard deviation is \u2018one\u2019 (Eqn. (1)). It does not get affected to outliers as there is no predefined range of the transformed features. The StandardScaler from Scikit-learn was used for implementation purposes. (1) X N e w = X − M e a n S t a n d a r d d e v i a t i o n 3.2.2 Handling imbalanced data Imbalanced data represents the uneven distribution of classes in the dataset which bring down the performance of the learning model due to biased predictions and highly affects the correlation of the features. Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) [2] is the most common resampling technique used to handle the class imbalance problem, which generates new samples by looking at the feature space of the minority class data points and its k nearest neighbors. The class labels (recommendation) of the energy optimization use cases are binary class labels (\u20180\u2019: No recommendation generated and \u20181\u2019: Recommendation is generated). The generated dataset for energy optimization use cases has a class imbalance problem with more records for label \u20180\u2019 (10,000 records) than label \u20181\u2019 (500 records). Therefore, SMOTE oversampling technique was applied to generate new samples based on the data records of the minority class. The SMOTE resampling sampling function is defined as, df_minority_upsampled = resample(df_minority, replace = True, # sample with replacement n_samples = len(df_majority), # to match majority class random_state = 42) # reproducible results 3.2.3 Missing value imputation Common scenarios in the data acquisition of the real time operational data of the smart homes are (i) missing data: data not received for certain timestamps, (ii) error data: incorrect format of the data, and (iii) out of the bound: data received do not fall in the specified range. It is highly important to handle such cases so that they do not affect the performance of the upstream data fusion pipelines. This study uses KNN imputer and Multiple Imputation by Chained Equation (MICE) missing value imputation techniques (Refer A.3 supplementary material for more details). 3.2.4 Outlier detection In general, outliers that exist in the dataset due to variability in the measurement, experimental errors, and anomaly affect the mean and standard deviation of the dataset resulting in unreliable model outcomes. Interquartile Range (IQR) is used to measure variability by dividing the dataset into quartiles. The data is sorted in increasing order and split into, (i) Quartile 1 (Q1): 25th percentile of the data (median of the dataset), (ii) Quartile 2 (Q2): 50th percentile of the data (median of n smallest data points), and (iii) Quartile 3 (Q3): 75th percentile of the data (median of n largest data points). IQR is defined as the range between first (Q1) and third quartiles (Q3) (Eqn. (2)). (2) I Q R = Q 3 \u2013 Q 1 The data points which fall below (Q1 \u2013 1.5*IQR) or above (Q3 + 1.5*IQR) are termed as outliers. IQR was effective in providing the accurate upper and lower bounds and therefore used in this study to handle the outliers. 3.2.5 Feature selection In this study, Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) is applied to the processed data, i.e., fused sensor data, plug load data, occupancy count and occupancy status for the identification of the informative features in the motive of increasing the efficiency of the decision engine module [1]. The PCC based feature selection technique evaluates the feature subsets based on the highly correlated features. The value of PCC lies in the range of [−1, 1], (i) closer to 0 or 0: weaker or no correlation, (ii) 1: stronger correlation and (iii) -1: stronger negative correlation. Fig. 5 presents the correlation heatmap of the various features in the smart home dataset. The occupancy is highly correlated with C O 2 (correlation coefficient \u2013 0.13) than the other features such as oven plug load (0.028) and tv plug load (0.086). This is evident from the logical fact that C O 2 level changes with respect to the increase/decrease in the number of occupants. Therefore, C O 2 is the most informative feature in the case of predicting the occupant status/count. 3.3 Implementation The technologies used to design the EMSS framework running on an edge-cloud computing platform are (i) Python: to build SMARTHome, an IoT simulator and advanced AI algorithms, (ii) Kafka message broker: to handle live streaming data and publish it to the subscribers, (iii) Apache Spark: to ingest the live data streams into the staging database, (iv) MongoDB: to stage and store real-time operational data, fused data, recommendations and user actions, and (iv) Power BI: to visualize and gain insights on the data. Consider a home equipped with an edge device, sensors, appliances, and camera. The primary steps involved in the edge provisioning to ensure that the edge device is registered and configured properly, are. (i) Home registration: Register the home with all necessary details such as home type, number of floors, block ID, address, and rooms. (ii) Resource allocation: New resources are allocated to the various pipelines (sensor, plug, video, decision, recommendation, controller, request and response) for the registered home. (iii) Upstream testing: Carried out to ensure the proper allocation of the resources to the registered home. The necessary details of each pipeline are fetched and updated in the configuration file to create personalized package for each user. (iv) Authentication: For authentication purposes, .pem file is generated for each registered home. (v) Update utility package: configuration file and.pem file are updated in the utility package. A download link is generated for the personalized edge utility package. This personalized utility package folder contains (a) .pem file: to ensure secure communication between the edge device and the server, (b) configuration file: contains required information such as available resources, pipelines and API endpoints for upstream communication between the edge device and the server, (c) code: contains IPcamerareader.py (reads data from IP cameras), utility_file.py (edge-server communication), iot_api (retrieves data from connected devices), and upstream_api (upstream testing, authentication, update and show config). The edge utility package is deployed in the edge device through containerization, i.e., a container image which has the edge utility package, necessary dependency and configuration files is deployed in the edge device. Once the edge device is registered and configured properly, the secure communication between the edge device and the server occurs with the help of the Kafka request-response mechanism with no knowledge of the edge device public IP address. The server API is deployed in the server to communicate with the locally exposed API end points (iot_api) in the edge devices. Whenever, the server API wants to communicate with the edge device, it drafts a request message with respect to the API endpoint and sends it to the request pipeline of the home ID. The edge device utility constantly listens to the request pipeline and once a message is received, it requests the appropriate local API to perform the intended action. On successful processing and response from the local API, the edge device utility drafts a response message with the request ID, API response, and response dictionary which is sent through the response pipeline allocated to the home ID. For each request ID, the server API constantly listens to the response pipeline for 4 s. If the server API receives response for the request ID within 4 s, it cross-checks the received response with the request ID, else it returns an error message (time out). Refer A.4 for request, response, time out message, data format (plug, sensor, and video pipeline). The get_connected_device API endpoint scans and retrieves the list of all available IoT devices in the smart home. On successful registration of the IoT devices, the sensor data from the IoT utility are sent through the MQTT communication protocol to the respective pipelines created during the home registration, i.e., sensor data, plug data, and video data will be sent to the sensor pipeline, plug pipeline, and video pipeline, respectively. Each pipeline has a corresponding topic created in the Kafka message broker and each topic has multiple partitions. The registered home is assigned to one partition under each topic. Therefore, each home is associated with eight partitions in each topic of the eight pipelines. {\u201cSensor_pipeline\u201d: [\u201ctopic_name\u201d,partition_no], \u201cPlug_pipeline\u201d: [\u201ctopic_name\u201d,partition_no], \u201cVideo_pipeline\u201d: [\u201ctopic_name\u201d,partition_no], \u201cDecision_pipeline\u201d: [\u201ctopic_name\u201d,partition_no], \u201cRecomm_pipeline\u201d: [\u201ctopic_name\u201d,partition_no], \u201cController_pipeline\u201d: [\u201ctopic_name\u201d,partition_no], \u201cRequest_pipeline\u201d: [\u201ctopic_name\u201d,partition_no], \u201cResponse_pipeline\u201d: [\u201ctopic_name\u201d,partition_no]} The spark streaming jobs process the data from the pipelines and store them in respective databases (MongoDB \u2013 sensor data and AWS S3 \u2013 image data). The interaction between the data source, Kafka server, Kafka client, and cloud database occurs: (i) sensor data is published to Kafka server on pre-defined topics, (ii) A consumer code running at the server has already subscribed to the respective topics to which Kafka server will publish the data, and (iii) Spark structured streaming jobs are executed to stage the data into appropriate database. These steps are executed with the help of the (a) IoT utility: sends the information of the available sensors and devices to the upstream utility on the edge device through an API end point; edge device establish secure connection with the server and is ready to send the data acquired from home; IoT utility collects the data from the sensors and devices and convert it into predefined JSON format, and (ii) upstream utility: publish the formatted data on corresponding data pipeline topics; server consumes the data and stores it in respective database with the help of spark streaming jobs. The data from the pipelines are further processed by the data fusion layer, decision layer, data visualization layer to generate actionable, explainable, persuasive, timely, and acceptable energy-saving recommendations. The generated energy-saving recommendations are presented to the user through the web and mobile user interface designed using React.js & React Native (frontend), Django (backend), Prometheus and Grafana. On the successful completion of setup procedures for edge device registration, admin & user registration, and device registration, the user lands in the smart home dashboard and analytics page. Fig. 6 presents the WebUI dashboard of an existing user. Various components in the dashboard and analytics page are detailed in Table 5 . . 3.4 Results and discussions The data streams from the sensor, plug, and video pipeline are fused by the data fusion engine to provide appropriate high-level features such as occupancy, energy consumption, environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, light, etc.), which are then sent along with the user actions for the previous recommendations to the decision engine for detecting moments to generate energy-saving recommendations. The decision engine module uses LSTM network to generate actionable, personalized, persuasive, and actionable energy-saving recommendations for the four-energy optimization use cases, (i) light management, (ii) AC management, (iii) appliance-energy management, and (iv) indoor air quality management. For experimentation purposes, random forest, support vector machines, k-nearest neighbor, decision trees, and LSTM were used to generate the energy-saving recommendations for each energy optimization use case. However, LSTM was used in the decision engine since it outperformed the other classifiers in terms of various classification metrics (Accuracy (%): 98.60\u201399.85; Precision (%): 98.54\u201399.54; Recall (%): 98.10\u201399.10; and F1-Score (%): 98.32\u201399.32). The inputs and the recommendations generation for each energy optimization use case are. (i) Light management: To prevent the unnecessary light usage, the data streams from the indoor and outdoor light sensors (illuminance), occupancy, status of the light switch, and user actions on the previous recommendation are fed as inputs to the decision layer to generate the recommendations, (i) Turn ON the light when the room is occupied, (ii) Turn OFF the light when the room is unoccupied, (iii) Turn OFF the light and open the screen when the room is occupied, and sufficient natural lighting is present, and (iv) Increase/decrease the indoor luminosity based on the outdoor light intensity. (ii) AC management: The data streams from the indoor and outdoor environmental sensors, occupancy, AC setpoint, AC plug, thermal comfort index and user actions on the previous recommendation are fed as input to the decision engine to generate the recommendations, (i) Turn ON the AC with the recommended setpoint when the room is occupied. and the indoor thermal comfort index is \u2018Less comfortable\u2019 and \u2018Uncomfortable\u2019, (ii) Turn OFF the AC when the room is unoccupied, (iii) Turn OFF the AC and suggest the user to open the window when the outdoor temperature is lesser than the indoor temperature, and (iv) Set the AC to the recommended setpoint based on the indoor thermal comfort index when the room is occupied. (iii) Appliance-energy management: The data streams from the plug sensors, indoor and outdoor environmental sensors, occupancy, and user actions on the previous recommendation are fed as input to the decision engine to generate the recommendations, (i) Turn OFF the appliance when the room is unoccupied, and (ii) Turn OFF the long running energy consuming appliances (iv) Indoor air quality management: The data streams from the indoor and outdoor environmental sensors, air purifier plug, occupancy, and user actions on the previous recommendation are fed as input to the decision engine to generate following recommendations, (i) Turn ON the air purifier when the air quality index of the room is above the healthy level, (ii) Turn ON the air purifier and open the windows when gas leak is detected, and (iii) Turn OFF the air purifier when the air quality index of the room is in healthy level. The LSTM network process the related information of the recent historical observations for every 20 min (AC management & indoor air quality management) and 10 min (appliance-energy management and light management) to derive appropriate energy-saving recommendations. A real-world experiment was carried out in a smart home with five users for the considered energy optimization use cases on light management, AC management, appliance energy management, and indoor air quality management. The possible recommendations are rendered and displayed to the user in an actionable, explainable, economical, contextual and user-sensitive manner. For example, the recommendation tile for AC management consists of: (i) actionable: create recommendation \u201cTurn OFF the AC and open the Window in the living room\u201d) based on the input sensor data (AC plug load and setpoint, temperature and humidity (indoor and outdoor); (ii) explainable: \u201cTurn OFF the AC and open the Window in the living room\u201d. The outdoor temperature is lower than the indoor temperature; (iii) economical: Taking the action to Turn OFF the AC and open the window as the outdoor temperature is lower than the indoor temperature will provide an economic benefit of $2.5 and ecological benefit of reducing 0.02 kg of carbon emissions in the monthly energy bill; and (iv) contextual and user-sensitive: user actions (accept/reject/ignore) on the recommendations generated when the outdoor temperature is lower than the indoor temperature will be saved and used to tailor the future recommendations of the user. Certain facets of the EMSS framework that prevents a fair comparative analysis with the state-of-the-art smart home optimization techniques in terms of data and intelligence algorithm are, (i) heterogeneous data sources: data from environmental sensors, occupancy sensors, and plug sensors; data are collected and fused from more than three sensors of same type, i.e., fused temperature data in the living room is derived from the three temperature sensors; (ii) energy optimization use cases: data generated for the considered energy optimization use cases is highly dependent on the configuration of the scenarios defined in the SMARTHome synthetic data generation module; and (iii) data fusion levels: data fusion applied to the high volume data generated by the heterogeneous data sources occurs at different levels, i.e., low-level fusion (environmental sensors), mid-level fusion (occupancy sensors), and high-level fusion (recommendation). A comparative analysis of EMSS framework with the state-of-the-art smart home framework was carried out based on the fusion level and technique, IoT technologies, recorded data, and platform architecture. Table 6 presents the comparative analysis of EMSS framework and the SOTA data fusion based energy efficiency framework for smear homes. To summarize, EMSS for energy optimization in smart homes built on an edge-cloud computing platform provides actionable, explainable, personalized, and persuasive energy-saving recommendations by (i) synthetic data generation framework to generate the real time operational data with respect to the building type and energy-saving use cases or micro-moments, (ii) processing the data from heterogeneous data sources involving structured (sensor and plug level data) and unstructured (image, video, and audio) data, (iii) applying low-level (sensor data), mid-level (camera and motion sensor), and high-level fusion (fused data), (iv) visualizing the various artifacts of the smart home environment through dashboard and analytics, and (v) actuation controls based on the user actions to the generated recommendations. The design and implementation of EMSS energy efficiency framework for energy optimization in smart home presents the solutions to the research questions formulated with respect to the challenges in the state-of-the-art energy efficiency frameworks for smart home. The unique solution to each research question is, (i) RQ1: What is the \u2018one-stop\u2019 solution for the data-related challenges such as data sparsity, cold start problem, real-time data collection, unavailability of open-source datasets, etc? SMARTHome, data generation framework provides real time operational data for different energy optimization scenarios, (ii) RQ2: Is there an efficient way to address uncertainties and improve the quality of the extracted information? use multiple sensors of same type and data quality enhancement techniques (missing value imputation, standardization, outlier detection and feature selection), (iii) RQ3: How to effectively use the broader scope of different levels of data fusion? application of low-level (sensor data), mid-level (camera and motion sensor), and high-level fusion (fused data), (iv) RQ4: What are the strategies to increase the user trust on the energy efficiency framework and acceptance rate of the recommendations for each micro-moment? Generating and presenting personalized energy-saving recommendations to the user along with its associated cause and outcome (economic and ecological benefit), and (v) RQ5: How to benchmark the energy efficiency framework? Fitting the energy efficiency framework with the taxonomy of data fusion based energy efficiency framework for smart homes in Ref. [9]. Research challenges with respect to the design of appropriate energy optimization scenarios and use cases for the accurate generation of synthetic data from SMARTHome and the time taken to learn from the user actions to generate timely and reliable energy-saving recommendations. 4 Conclusion With the design of EMSS, web and mobile application for energy optimization in smart spaces, novelty of the work lies in the (i) a scalable and reliable end-to-end data fusion platform, (ii) synthetic data generation framework to mimic the real-world scenario and use cases in different smart spaces, (iii) different data fusion levels and algorithms, (iii)generate actionable, explainable, personalized, and persuasive recommendations at the right moment, (iv) web and mobile applications to drive and instigate the energy conscious behaviour of the user, and (v) EMSS energy efficiency framework built with latest technologies in Kafka, Apache Spark, dockers, MongoDB, React, and Django on edge-cloud computing infrastructure. The practical implication of this study is to instigate the energy-efficiency-driven end user behaviour to promote long-term energy efficiency, economic and ecological goals by providing efficient control and optimization of the smart spaces with reliable recommender algorithms, AI techniques, and sensor/smartphone infrastructure. The limitations of the EMSS are two-folds, (i) number of sensors and appliances, energy optimization scenarios and respective energy-saving recommendations should be carefully designed prior to the execution of the SMARTHome for synthetic data generation, and (ii) time required for the system to adapt to the user profile for the generation of timely and appropriate energy-saving recommendations based on the user actions and behaviour during the recent time intervals. The future scope of the work includes the exploration of advanced technologies (blockchains and cryptocurrencies) and visualization tools to motivate end-user behavioural change.

        "dc:description": "Advancements in Internet of Energy (IoE) technologies drive the development of several energy efficient frameworks for better energy optimization, economic savings, safety, and security in smart homes. However, certain challenges such as real-time operational data for each micro-moment, proper application of data fusion techniques, and end-to-end computing and deployment architecture prevent the establishment of an effective energy-efficient framework to provide personalized energy-saving recommendations. This work presents energy management for smart spaces (EMSS), the proposed energy efficiency framework implemented in an edge-cloud computing platform that fuses data from heterogeneous data sources (environmental sensors, camera, plug data, etc.) at appropriate data fusion levels and process them to generate actionable, explainable, personalized, and persuasive recommendations at the right moment. The user response to the generated recommendations triggers the actuators to perform respective energy-saving actions and provide more personalized future recommendations. Further, SMARTHome - a data generation framework based on configurable scenario files and a set of software codes was proposed to generate synthetic data with respect to different building types and micro-moments. The functionalities of the EMSS (device and user registration), user dashboard, analytics, and energy-saving recommendations were made accessible to the user through web and mobile applications. The validation analysis of the EMSS was performed by (i) comparative analysis of the machine learning and deep learning algorithms used by the decision engine to generate energy-saving recommendations and (ii) benchmarking of EMSS based on the taxonomy of data fusion-based energy efficiency frameworks for smart homes.",
