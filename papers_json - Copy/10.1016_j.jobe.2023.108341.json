Recent studies highlight surrogate models as efficient alternatives to energy simulation tools, reducing computational burden. However, accurate metamodels often require extensive evaluations, leading to high computational costs. Adaptive sampling approaches offer a promising solution by constructing accurate surrogate models at a lower computational expense compared to static sampling. The selection of an appropriate adaptive sampling criterion is crucial in sequential sampling strategies, as it determines how new sample points are chosen based on previous iterations. However, concerns remain regarding the impact of the sampling infill criterion on surrogate model accuracy. Additionally, a lack of studies exists comparing artificial neural networks (ANN) and Kriging models in terms of potential computational improvements through sequential sampling. This study aims to explore the potential of adaptive sampling strategies to estimate optimal building energy consumption within a reasonable computational budget, thus reducing the number of energy simulation model runs required. Furthermore, a comprehensive comparison between sequential sampling techniques employing ANN-based and Kriging-based surrogate models is conducted. Four different sampling criteria are evaluated to understand the relationship between sampling strategies and accuracy. The findings contribute to a more efficient resolution of building optimization problems. The results indicate that the choice of a sampling strategy depends on the model's requirements and the specific problem. Each strategy has distinct strengths and weaknesses, necessitating careful consideration of the model's needs. Selecting the appropriate sampling strategy improves model accuracy and reduces training time. Adaptive sampling methods yield significant improvements, saving 25 %\u201368 % of simulation samples compared to static approaches.

If no energy-saving measures are taken to lower buildings' energy use, GHG emissions from buildings will almost double by 2030 [2]. Therefore, many policies aim to improve new and existing building energy performance (BEP). The development of building codes and standards that mandate energy efficiency in building design and construction has become more widespread. These codes and standards typically set minimum requirements for insulation, ventilation, and other building envelope parameters to improve energy performance and reduce GHG emissions. The building envelope can considerably influence BEP since it is the primary heat loss/gain source. Therefore, determining the best trade-offs of different building envelope configurations to achieve better energy performance is crucial to the building simulation community. Traditional approaches use detailed building energy simulation tools such as TRNSYS [3]. These methods require a massive number of evaluations of building energy consumption. The computational time of the detailed hourly simulations may become the major challenge of such approaches. There have been efforts to develop faster and more efficient methods for evaluating building energy performance [4\u20137]. One such approach is the use of simplified energy models, which rely on simplified input data and assumptions to predict building energy consumption. These models can significantly reduce computational time while providing reasonable accuracy. Another approach is the use of surrogate models, commonly referred to as metamodels. Metamodels are specialized models that, unlike conventional data-driven models, are designed to capture the underlying relationships and patterns between different building parameters and energy consumption [8]. They serve as efficient approximations of complex, often computationally expensive, simulation-based models. These metamodels facilitate the identification of optimal building envelope configurations for enhanced energy performance by reducing the computational cost associated with running simulations. The use of surrogate models is a rising field of research in the energy-efficient design of a building. Surrogate models are attracting a lot of attention. They promise to find the optimal design at a reasonable computational cost [8]. Surrogate modelling uses mathematical models to emulate building energy simulations [9]. These metamodels can be used as a less computationally costly alternative than building energy simulation tools during optimization. Various types of metamodeling techniques are used to construct a surrogate model of a system, such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), the Kriging model which is a particular form of Gaussian Process (GP), regression model, and support vector regression. A surrogate model is computationally significantly cheaper to evaluate and enables to return of design performance estimates almost instantaneously. Nonetheless, the cost of collecting simulation samples remains significant. Indeed, reducing the sampling time in the surrogate derivation process is crucial and outweighs surrogate model training and evaluation. By using an optimum sampling plan called \u201cDesign of Experiment\u201d, the information gained per simulation run can be maximized. Two different paradigms for selecting simulation samples are static sampling and adaptive sampling. In static sampling, all samples are chosen in one shot. In this case, the individual design inputs (sample) are picked to homogeneously fill the space of possible design options. In adaptive sampling, the sampling process typically begins with a set of initial points or samples. These initial samples are usually selected using a specific strategy or design, such as Latin hypercube sampling (LHS), random sampling, or uniform sampling. The goal of these initial samples is to cover the input space of the problem adequately. Once the initial samples are obtained, they are used to fit a metamodel. Then based on an adaptive sampling criterion, it solves an optimization problem to iteratively add new points and update the metamodel until a stopping criterion is met (until a desired level of accuracy or convergence is achieved). Adaptive sampling for building optimization problems (BOP) has received limited attention in the literature. About eleven studies have utilized adaptive sampling up to date, and a majority of these papers have employed it to generate a GP model. An advantage of the GP regression model, as opposed to ANN, can estimate the uncertainty of predictions. This feature has been employed by Ref. [10\u201314] as a means of sample selection. For example, Gengembre et al. [11] used an efficient global optimization approach using a Kriging surrogate model and PSO algorithm to optimize the life cycle cost of a single-zone building. The Kriging metamodel serves as a surrogate model, replacing the need for running full energy building simulations for each design evaluation. This allows for faster evaluations and a reduction in computational time. Prada [14] investigated the impact of using surrogate models, including adaptive sampling, in time-saving in part of their study. They found savings of more than 80 % are feasible, particularly for complex design spaces. A limitation of GP is that this method becomes inefficient when the number of training samples is large [15]. Østergård et al. [15] compared the performance of six metamodeling approaches, including linear regression, GP, ANN, SVR, random forest, and multivariate adaptive regression splines, in 13 diverse problems. Results showed that ANN is the most suitable method in terms of accuracy for problems with a large number of training samples. Bamdad et al. [16] developed a new sequential sampling, called L-SOAS, based ANN surrogate model and compared it with both the surrogate model-based optimization method using random sampling and simulation-based optimization. For the simulation-based optimization, two algorithms: PSOIW and ACOR were used as benchmarks. The results indicated The surrogate model-based optimization methods, using L-SOAS, achieved better results compared to simulation-based optimization in terms of optimality and computational time, requiring a lower number of simulation calls. The method demonstrated better performance at the early stages of optimization, producing solutions within 1 % of the best solution found using fewer simulations. Specifically, in the Brisbane case study, this resulted in approximately 200 fewer simulations compared to other methods. These findings highlight the potential of sequential sampling methods, such as L-SOAS, to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of surrogate model-based optimization methods for BOP. The most important issue in sequential sampling strategies is how to choose a new sample point according to information obtained in previous iterations, which can be called the adaptive sampling criterion. The number of studies using this method is limited and there are still concerns regarding the impact of the sampling infill criterion on the surrogate model accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, no studies compare ANN against the Kriging model to quantify the potential computational improvements using sequential sampling. Accordingly, this study makes two contributions to the literature. First, this study aims to investigate the potential of adaptive sampling strategies in estimating the optimal energy consumption of a building while minimizing computational resources. By utilizing adaptive sampling, the researchers intend to reduce the number of energy simulation model runs required, thus achieving computational efficiency in the optimization process. Secondly, this study seeks to compare the performance of two surrogate models, specifically an artificial neural network (ANN) based surrogate model and a Kriging-based surrogate model. The researchers will examine the effectiveness of these models in conjunction with sequential sampling. Additionally, the study will analyze and compare the results obtained using five different sampling criteria, shedding light on the relationship between sampling strategies and accuracy in the context of BOP. A typical building in Ben Guerir City in Morocco is considered as the case study. The insights gained from this analysis will contribute to more effectively addressing BOP by guiding the selection of appropriate sampling strategies based on specific modelling requirements. By selecting the appropriate sampling strategy, model accuracy can be improved, and training time can be reduced. The ultimate goal of this study is to advance the field of building energy performance optimization by providing valuable recommendations for the adoption of adaptive sampling approaches and the selection of surrogate models. This paper has four sections, including the introduction. Section 2 outlines the approach used in the study. It begins with a description of the building energy simulation model, which serves as the basis for the analysis. The problem formulation is then discussed, specifying the variables and parameters of interest. Surrogate models are introduced, including ANN and Kriging, which are utilized to approximate the building simulation model. The sequential sampling procedure and adaptive sampling strategies are explained, highlighting their role in improving the efficiency of the analysis. Section 3 presents the results and discussion. An overview of the obtained results is provided, followed by a detailed analysis and interpretation of the findings. Finally, section 4 consists of the conclusions, where the main findings of the study are summarized and the research objectives are revisited. The significance of the results is emphasized, and potential recommendations or future directions are suggested. 2 Methodology 2.1 Building energy simulation model 2.1.1 Building description and envelope materials The base building of this study has a rectangular shape and covers a total of 48 m2 of living area. Its opaque envelope has a thermal transmittance of approximately 0.76\u20131.19 W/m2K. The geometry model of the reference prototype building created by Sketchup is shown in Fig. 1 . It is worth mentioning that this same prototype building is the subject of a project supported by the \u201cInstitute for Research in Solar Energy and New Energy\u201d under a research project aiming to develop smart thermo-acoustic partitions based on local ecological materials using an integrated Building Lifecycle Management approach. Specific details about the building envelope materials are provided in Table 1 . 2.1.2 Building operational assumptions For the purpose of our simulation, certain operational assumptions were set in place. We assumed that the prototype building would be cooled over 26 °C and heated below 20 °C. We also set the infiltration rate at 0.6 air changes per hour. The lighting density and the equipment density are set to 10 W/m2 and 15W/m2, respectively. The occupants were supposed to be three people and the occupation schedule is presented in Fig. 2 for weekdays and weekends. The X-axis represents time in hours, while the Y-axis signifies heat gains in watts (W). In this representation, the graph provides a visual depiction of how the building's heat gains vary over the course of a typical day for both weekdays and weekends. The heat gains are primarily influenced by the presence and activities of the building's occupants. By examining this graph, readers can gain insights into the dynamic nature of heat gains and their impact on the building's thermal performance throughout the day, aiding in the assessment of energy consumption patterns. 2.1.3 Simulation tool for thermal analysis After considering several energy simulation tools, TRNSYS (Transient System Simulation Tool) simulation program is adopted to simulate the thermal behaviour of the considered building. The software was developed by the Solar Energy Laboratory at the University of Wisconsin in the 1970s and has since been continuously updated and improved [3]. Its widespread use in the building field, particularly for designing and analyzing energy-efficient buildings, made it a suitable choice. To evaluate the building's thermal load for both heating and cooling energy consumption, we performed computations for a total of 8760 h using a 1-h timestep. We established a reference building without any energy efficiency measures as the baseline configuration. The building was indeed modeled as a single thermal zone due to its small size and the homogeneity of its thermal envelope. This simplification allows for faster simulations and facilitates the comparison of different scenarios. 2.1.4 Weather data The study is centered in Ben Guerir, a city located in the fifth climatic zone according to the Moroccan building thermal code. This region experiences a semi-arid climate characterized by mild, damp winters and hot, dry summers. In our effort to model real-world conditions, we obtained climate data using the Meteonorm software and generated a TMY2 file based on the geographical coordinates 32°37\u2032N 8°00\u2032W. To ensure data accuracy and reliability, we verified our climate data with information available on the website https://climate.onebuilding.org/WMO_Region_1_Africa/MAR_Morocco/ 2.2 Optimization problem formulation Building performance optimization (BPO) is a crucial task in achieving energy-efficient and sustainable buildings. As it was previously discussed, simulation-based optimization techniques have become increasingly popular for addressing BPO problems. This involves integrating building performance simulation (BPS) software with a numerical optimization algorithm. The BPS software calculates the objective function, which represents the building's performance (e.g., energy consumption, thermal comfort), while the optimization algorithm adjusts the design parameters to achieve the desired performance. Among the various numerical optimization algorithms used for BPO, the Genetic Algorithm (GA) stands out as a widely employed method. GA, a subset of Evolutionary Algorithms, share the overarching concept of being population-based optimization methods [17]. In both GA and other Evolutionary Algorithms, multiple candidate solutions are evaluated during each iteration of the optimization process. This population produces a new generation of solutions by applying mathematical operators such as crossover and mutation. These operators draw parallels to their biological counterparts: crossover combines traits from two or more parent solutions to create new offspring, while mutation introduces random modifications to an individual solution. We chose the GA over other optimization algorithms for several specific reasons, which include its ability to address the complex nature of BPO problems more effectively. Regarding the advantages of GA, Kheiri [9] highlights that GA is a population-based algorithm that can explore a large search space of potential solutions simultaneously, making it flexible and suitable for a wide range of optimization problems. Additionally, GA is classified as a global-optimum finding algorithm, which means that it can find the optimum solution globally, rather than getting stuck in local optima. GA can handle non-linear and non-convex problems, multiple objectives, and noisy and incomplete data, making it a robust algorithm for BPO. Starting with the clear definition of objectives, design variables and constraints, GAs come into play by evolving a population of potential building designs through selection, crossover, and mutation operations. To solve BPO we seek to maximize or minimize a certain objective function denoted as f ( · ) . This function maps the design space X ⊂ R n . Our goal is to identify the optimal solution within this design space. The design space is defined by a vector of independent design variables, x , where x = [ x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x n ] , representing n decision variables that influence the system's performance. The feasibility of our design space is established by a set of constraints that impose lower and upper bounds on the values of these variables. For each variable i, we have − ∞ < x i l ≤ x i ≤ x i u < + ∞ , with x i l and x i u are the lower and upper boundaries of the design variable, respectively. In the context of our research, a specific normalization approach is adopted. 2.2.1 Case study 1 The particular problem we present in this first case is the optimal sizing of windows (WWR) and orientation of the building to optimize its heating and cooling performance. The yearly heating loads Q h (kWh/m2.year) and cooling load Q c (kWh/m2.year) are calculated as a result of the thermal simulation. This case study aims to reduce the Energy Consumption (EC) of building designs, the optimization problem can be figured out by Eq. (1) (1) { M i n i m i z i n g E C ( x ) = Q h ( x ) + Q c ( x ) S u b j e c t t o : x i l ≤ x i ≤ x i u f o r a l l i = { 1 ; 2 } Where x is the vector of design variables, while x i l and x i u are the lower and upper boundaries of the design variable (listed in Table 2 ). The variables under consideration in this study and their corresponding ranges are listed in Table 1. Window-to-wall ratio (WWR) is defined as the ratio between the glazed surface and the gross façade area. An insulation layer (λ = 0.03 W/(m K)) was added to the walls, roof and floor and its thickness was changed accordingly to the range of thermal transmittance. The typology of the window was chosen among six options, whose glazing characteristics are reported in Table 3 . This study maintains a consistent glazing type for all windows within the building. 2.2.2 Case study 2 Six design variables detailed previously in Table 2 are considered in this case study. The Life cycle cost assessment LCC ($/m2) is considered here as the objective function. This indicator is the sum of Investment Cost IC ($/m2) divided by the lifetime of the building N and the yearly cost of energy CE ($/m2) as indicated in eq (2). The following optimization problem is then considered: (2) { M i n i m i z i n g L C C ( x ) = I C ( x ) N + C E ( x ) S u b j e c t t o : x i l ≤ x i ≤ x i u f o r a l l i = i = 1,2 \u2026 , n ; n = 6 The IC considers only the building implementations concerning energy issues, i.e., by considering the cost related to the insulation thickness and the type of windows. While CE is evaluated based on the cost of the electrical consumption due to heating and cooling over one year. It can be calculated using the following equation: (3) EC = Q H . C e . PWF COP + Q C . C e . PWF ERR Where Q H and Q C are the annual heating and cooling load, respectively. C e is the cost of electricity, COP and ERR are the coefficients of performance and Energy Efficiency Ratio of the air source heat pumps for heating and cooling modes, respectively. The PWF is the Present Worth Factor, a coefficient related to the economic situation; its value depends on the inflation rate g, the lifetime of the building N (years) and the interest rate i. The following formula can be used to compute it: (4) PWF = ( 1 + r ) N \u2010 1 r ( 1 + r ) N if { i > g r = i \u2010 g 1 + g i < g r = g \u2010 i 1 + i (5) PWF = N 1 + i if i = g 2.3 Surrogate models Surrogate models, or metamodels, have gained intensive attention in different types of building performance analyses. The motivation for using metamodels is to reduce the computational time. Metamodels are a suitable alternative to standard building simulation models for the conceptual design stage, sensitivity and uncertainty analysis, and design optimization [8,18]. Whenever applied, they are much faster to evaluate than the original function. In particular, for optimization purposes, Magnier and Haghigat [19] demonstrated that the optimization would have just not been feasible without using ANN metamodel. They stated that the optimization process for the building design took approximately three weeks, while if the NSGA-II algorithm had been directly linked with the simulation tool, it would require ten years to complete the task. Constructing a metamodel typically involves four steps: data generation, model selection, model fitting, and model validation. In the data generation step, a sampling strategy is employed to generate data that will be used to train the metamodel. Next, the surrogate model that will best represent the data must be chosen. The most commonly used metamodeling methods for building performance optimization problems are artificial neural networks (ANN) and Gaussian processes (also known as Kriging)[20]. Therefore, it was the main motivation to choose them in this study to construct the surrogate model. Once the surrogate model is selected, the third step is to fit it using a training algorithm to tune the model's hyperparameters. Finally, the model's accuracy must be validated using different performance metrics. 2.3.1 Artificial neural networks ANN has been widely used for different building performance problems area, such as optimization [4,5,16,19,21\u201323], prediction [24,25], and metamodel comparison [15,26]. Among the existing kinds of ANN, we focus, here, on the ordinary Multilayer feedforward neural networks (MFNN) with two hidden layers. The MFNN is a type of artificial neural network that consists of an input layer, multiple hidden layers, and an output layer. Each layer in the network contains multiple neurons, which are connected to all the neurons in the next layer through weighted connections. MFNN with two hidden layers strikes a good balance between complexity and computational efficiency. Deeper networks with more hidden layers may require significantly more computational resources and training data, making them harder to train and optimize. Two hidden layers provide a reasonable compromise in terms of model complexity and practicality. The output of a neuron in a layer is calculated as a weighted sum of the inputs to the neuron, followed by the application of a transfer function. The weighted sum is computed as follows: (6) y j = ∑ ( w i j x i + b j ) where y j is the weighted sum of inputs to neuron j, w i j is the weight of the connection between neuron i in the previous layer and neuron j in the current layer, x i is the output of neuron i in the previous layer, and b j is the bias term for neuron j . The transfer function applied to the weighted sum is typically a nonlinear function, such as the sigmoid function, which is defined as: (7) f ( y j ) = 1 ( 1 + e − y j ) The output of each neuron in the current layer is the result of applying the transfer function to the weighted sum of inputs. The output of the entire layer is a vector of outputs from all the neurons in that layer. The number of neurons in the input layer corresponds to the number of inputs to the model, and the number of neurons in the output layer corresponds to the number of outputs from the model. The number of neurons in the hidden layers is determined through a process of hyperparameter tuning, which often involves varying the number of neurons and assessing their effect on the model's performance using a validation set. Through k-fold cross-validation, the training set is divided into k subsets. In each iteration, a different subset is used as the validation set, while the remaining subsets are used for training. During these iterations, various configurations of the ANN, with different numbers of neurons, are tested. The performance metrics are recorded for each configuration. This process helps identify the neuron count that yields the best performance on unseen data. Once determined, this optimal configuration is used to train a final model on the entire training set, and its performance is assessed on a separate test set to ensure it generalizes well. Cross-validation aids in fine-tuning ANNs and ensures they are robust and effective. The training process involves adjusting the weights and biases of the connections between the neurons to minimize the error between the predicted outputs and the actual outputs. This is typically done using a method called backpropagation, which involves computing the gradient of the error concerning the weights and biases and using that gradient to update the weights and biases. In conclusion, the MFNN is a powerful tool for modelling complex relationships between inputs and outputs in a wide range of applications including building performance optimization. 2.3.2 Kriging Kriging is a widely used surrogate model that approximates complex functions using only a few samples. It was originally proposed by Krige in 1951 for mining analysis and geostatistics but has since been applied in various domains. The basic idea of Kriging is to estimate the value of a system at a given point (representing a design configuration in the case of building design) by linearly combining training samples, with weights determined by their distance to the point. Points closer in design space are assumed to have similar characteristics. By using Kriging as a surrogate model, architects can efficiently evaluate the performance of different building designs, reducing computational costs and aiding in decision-making. The Kriging metamodel treats the function of interest f as a realization of a Gaussian stochastic process F combining a global model plus a localized departure and can be formulated as: (8) F ( x ) = μ ( x ) + є ( x ) Given the samples x ∈ R d for d design variables, μ ( x ) is a regression function (usually polynomial), and є ( x ) stands for a GP in terms of zero mean, with variance σ 2 ∈ R and nonzero covariance. Numerous Kriging methods exist, such as Ordinary Kriging, Universal Kriging, Trend Kriging, etc. The form of the regression function is what differentiates the various approaches [27]. In a GP, the covariance between two points x and x ' is given by a kernel function, also known as a covariance function or a correlation function. A common choice for the kernel function in GP is the Gaussian kernel. The covariance of є ( x ) is given by: (9) C o v [ є ( x ) , є ( x \u2032 ) ] = σ 2 exp ( − ∑ i = 1 d θ i | x i − x i \u2032 | 2 ) Where x i and x i \u2032 are i-th components of the samples x and x \u2032 .The hyperparameters θ are estimated as the solution of an optimization problem. To Establish the Kriging metamodel, the stochastic process F must be approximated by a process F ˆ . f ˆ the approximation of the function f is considered to be the predicted mean of F ˆ as follow: (10) f ˆ ( x ) = E [ F ˆ ( x ) ] Where E[] is the expectation of the stationary Gaussian process. We choose ordinary Kriging models with the Gaussian correlation function. In ordinary Kriging, the mean and variance of the variable are estimated at each location based on the values and locations of nearby sample points. This estimation process allows for the modelling of spatial dependence, which is particularly important in Building optimization applications. This is because the behaviour and performance of building systems are influenced by the spatial arrangement of building components and elements. Surrogate model is constructed based on a subset of data, known as the training sample, to represent the underlying relationship between input and output variables. Consider a set of n s samples s = ( s 1 , s 2 \u2026 , s n s ) ∈ M n s , d ( R ) , and the set of their images by f is denoted u = ( u 1 , u 2 , \u2026, u n s ) ∈ R n s . For each sample i , we therefore have u i = f ( s i ) ∈ R . An ordinary Kriging model uses a linear combination of sample values ( u i ) to estimate the value of an unsampled point. It is written as: (11) F ˆ ( x ) = μ + ∑ i = 1 n s λ i ( x ) ( u i − μ ) The weights λ i for each sample are determined based on the spatial relationship between the sample and the location of interest. The predictions at an unsampled location x can then be obtained by expanding Eq. (5) and considering the non-bias constraint ( E [ F ˆ ( x ) ] = E [ F ( x ) ] ) . f ˆ ( x ) can be calculated as: (12) f ˆ ( x ) = μ ˆ + c ( x ) T C − 1 ( u − μ ˆ ) , { c ( x ) = ( C o v ( є ( x ) , є ( s 1 ) ) , \u2026 , C o v ( є ( x ) , є ( s n s ) ) ) ∈ R n s C = [ C o v ( є ( s i ) , є ( s j ) ) ] 1 ≤ i , j ≤ n s ∈ M n s ( R ) Where (·)T is the transpose of vector, and μ ˆ is the prediction value of μ . Equation (12) calculates the Kriging model value of f ( x ) . It depends on (d + 2) parameters that must be determined including Kriging hyperparameters. The optimal values of these hyperparameters are important for the accuracy of the Kriging predictions whose identification is achieved using various methods such as maximum likelihood estimation, genetic algorithm and Bayesian inference. The particularity of the Kriging model, as opposed to ANN, is that it also provides an estimate of its prediction error at any point in space. In recent years, various algorithms have been developed to exploit this Kriging information as a means of sample selection (infill criterion) for the sequential search of the input space. These algorithms generate initial sample points (referred to as the initial design) and fit the initial Kriging metamodel. The Kriging metamodel is then sequentially updated by selecting new samples based on the prediction error information. The procedure repeats until the stopping criteria are satisfied. These sequential algorithms are beneficial to fit the Kriging model when the computational budget is limited and the simulation model is time-consuming to run. They allow training globally accurate Kriging surrogate models in an efficient way. Yet, from an optimization point of view, the designer is not interested in having a globally accurate model over the whole design space but rather a model representing the region likely to be optimal and, therefore, a locally accurate model. The information brought by the infill criterion is a key concept of how to refine the metamodel accuracy, which will be introduced below in the following subsection. 2.4 Sequential sampling procedure Sample generation can be classified into two categories: one-shot sampling and sequential sampling. One-shot sampling also known as static sampling refers to the process of generating a fixed set of sample points before the simulation or modeling process begins. Regarding the building field related literature, we found that LHS is the most widely used sample strategy in surrogate modelling research [15]. LHS is a stratified sampling type. Each dimension space, which represents a variable, is divided into K equal sections resulting in KN hypercubes, where N is the number of sample points. LHS has the property to make points fill up the entire domain, meanwhile; in LHS the samples are chosen in such a way that in each section we put only one point. Static sampling has the drawback that it may take several samples to get an acceptable degree of accuracy; for this reason, adaptive sampling algorithms are advantageous. Adaptive sampling, as its name suggests, places more points in regions of interest by learning the information from previous data and metamodels. Sequential sampling, on the other hand, is a dynamic process where data points are selected in a predetermined order, one at a time, until the desired sample size is achieved. It includes both space-filling sequential sampling and adaptive sequential sampling. Space-filling sequential sampling aims to generate points that spread over the entire domain evenly, whereas adaptive sequential sampling adjusts the selection based on the information gathered from previous data and metamodels [28]. explain that the adaptive sampling strategy is particularly useful for simulation-based problems because it has the potential to build accurate global metamodels with fewer sample points than space-filling sampling methods. This can result in significant cost savings by reducing the number of simulations required to build the metamodel. In other words, adaptive sampling can help to efficiently explore the design space and identify the optimal solution with fewer simulations. The process of adaptive sampling begins with an initial set of sample points to construct a metamodel representing the target function. An adaptive sampling criterion is then used to select new sample points that are expected to improve the accuracy of the metamodel. Various strategies, including exploitation (selecting points where the model performs well), exploration (choosing points with high uncertainty to explore unexplored areas), and trade-off (balancing exploration and exploitation) can be used to generate the new points. These new sample points are then integrated with existing samples, and the metamodel is updated. The iterative process continues until the metamodel meets desired accuracy levels or computational resources are exhausted. Adaptive sampling efficiently explores the design space, striking a balance between exploiting known information and exploring unexplored regions, reducing the need for extensive simulations, making it particularly valuable in optimization and decision-making processes. 2.5 Adaptive sampling strategies Different exploration and exploitation metrics exist, called adaptive sampling criteria. They enable to build an accurate global metamodel or produce a surrogate model that is accurate locally over the region of interest, such as identifying the areas where the optima are possibly located. To investigate the possible impacts of the sampling strategy on the accuracy of the surrogate model and the optimality of the result, five sampling strategies are used. - Error-based adaptive sampling (Error): This sampling strategy is based on selecting new design points at locations where the surrogate model has large prediction errors. The model prediction errors can be quantified by Root Relative Square Error (RRSE) which estimates the difference between the predicted and actual response values. The RRSE is a measure of the variance explained by the surrogate model, and a higher value indicates a larger prediction error. The sampling algorithm selects new design points in the regions where the RRSE values are higher to improve the accuracy of the surrogate model. RRSE is given as (13) R R S E = ∑ i = 1 n ( y i − y ˆ i ) ∑ i = 1 n ( y i − y \u203e ) Where y i is the ith response of the system, y ˆ i is the ith predicted response by the surrogate model and y \u203e stands for the empirical mean of the data. RRSE is considered an exploitation criterion that well estimates the actual prediction errors over the domain and adds infill points at the regions with higher estimated RRSE values to build a model as accurately as possible. In the practical implementation of Error-based adaptive sampling method, the process begins with an initial set of design points, serving as the foundation for the surrogate model. After training the initial surrogate model, we calculate RRSE values for each design point, reflecting the accuracy of the model's predictions. To guide the selection of new design points, we offer the option of employing a user-defined threshold on RRSE values. Points with RRSE values surpassing this threshold are identified as candidates for further sampling. The algorithm then strategically selects new design points in regions with higher RRSE values, using various techniques, such as optimization algorithms or space-filling designs, to address these areas of larger prediction errors. These selected new design points are thoughtfully integrated into the existing dataset, and the surrogate model is retrained. This iterative process is pivotal, as it progressively enhances the model's predictive accuracy by focusing on regions of the design space with the most substantial prediction errors. - Lola-Voronoi algorithm (LV): The LV algorithm is a powerful approach that effectively balances exploration and exploitation within the design space. Its implementation begins with the creation of a Voronoi tessellation, a geometric framework that divides the design space into regions, with each region representing the area around a designated seed point. Seed points are typically selected initially, often at random. The algorithm leverages surrogate models, including Gaussian processes and neural networks, to predict response values at these seed points. The magic of the LV algorithm lies in its selection of new design points for evaluation, guided by two crucial criteria. Firstly, it identifies regions with the highest prediction uncertainty, signaling areas where the surrogate model's predictions lack reliability. Secondly, it pinpoints regions with the highest predicted response values, indicating potential optimal solutions. These criteria harmoniously steer the algorithm, facilitating the exploration of uncertain regions and the exploitation of promising areas. This process operates iteratively, as new design points are selected, evaluated, and incorporated into the tessellation. Subsequently, the surrogate model is retrained, and the iteration continues until convergence or the satisfaction of predefined stopping conditions. In this way, the LV algorithm harnesses Voronoi tessellation and surrogate models to intelligently and adaptively guide the sampling process for efficient optimization. Let X be the design space, and let x 1 , x 2 , \u2026 , x n be the initial set of design points. Let S i be the Voronoi cell of x i , which represents the region of X that is closest to x i than to any other design point. Let f ˆ ( x ) be the surrogate model of the response function, and let σ ² ( x ) be the predicted variance of f ˆ ( x ) at x . The uncertainty measure for each region S i can be defined as: (14) U ( S i ) = ∫ S i σ ² ( x ) d x Where the integral is over the region S i . The LV algorithm selects a new design point x n e w as follows: (15) x n e w = argmax U ( S i ) Where the argmax is taken over all Voronoi cells S i that have not been sampled before. - Sample Minimum (SampleMin): This strategy is a valuable approach, particularly suited for optimization problems where the primary objective is to locate the design point that either minimizes or maximizes the objective function. This method is adept at inferring the regions within the design space that harbor the optimal solutions. The implementation of the SampleMin strategy is straightforward yet highly effective. It begins with the surrogate model's prediction of response values across the design space. The focus here is on identifying regions with the lowest predicted response values. These regions are indicative of the potential optima, where the objective function's extrema are most likely to be found. As such, the SampleMin strategy strategically selects new design points within these regions, effectively guiding the optimization process toward the optimum while refining the surrogate model's accuracy in proximity to the optimal solution. This process can be iterative, allowing for continuous improvement and convergence toward the optimal design point. The SampleMin strategy, with its clear focus on identifying the minimum of the surrogate model, is an essential tool for achieving precision in optimization tasks, ensuring that valuable resources are allocated where they are most needed. The SampleMin strategy selects a new design point x n e w as follows: (16) x n e w = argmin f ˆ ( x ) Where the argmin is taken over the design space X , excluding the initial set of design points. - Expected Improvement (EI): A sampling algorithm has been proposed for sequential Kriging-based optimization problems [29]. The principle of the EI procedure is as follows: It is a local exploitation criterion that aims to define a new design point as the vector of input parameter values that maximizes a predefined expected improvement function. The energy simulation model is then executed at the new design point, and the surrogate model is updated to incorporate the result at the new design point. The algorithm iterates between the surrogate model building step and the sequential design step until the increase of the expected improvement function become negligible. The Expected Improvement (EI) algorithm aims to find a new design point that maximizes a predefined expected improvement function EI(x) over the search space. The expected improvement function is defined as: (17) E I ( x ) = E [ max ( f ˆ ( x b e s t ) − f ˆ ( x ) , 0 ) ] Where x b e s t is the current best design point found so far, f ( x ) is the predicted value of the objective function at point x by the surrogate model, and E [ . ] denotes the expectation operator. The expected improvement function measures the potential improvement in the objective function at a new point compared to the current best point x b e s t . To find the next design point, the EI algorithm searches for point x which maximizes the expected improvement function EI(x) over the search space. This optimization problem is typically solved using a global optimization algorithm such as Bayesian optimization, which iteratively selects candidate points and evaluates the expected improvement function at those points. Once the next design point is found, the energy simulation model is evaluated at that point, and the surrogate model is updated to incorporate the new data. The algorithm iterates between the surrogate model building step and the sequential design step until the improvement in the expected improvement function becomes negligible, or a predefined stopping criterion is met. 2.6 The overall workflow and computational setup In this section, we present an integrated workflow that illustrates how the various components of our research methodology come together to address the objectives of this study. The overall workflow involves the following steps as depicted in Fig. 3 . 1. Define the problem: Clearly define the optimization problem of the study, including the input variables, the objective function, and the constraints. 2. Initialize the model: Select an initial sample of points using LHS. The number of initial samples was determined based on the number of design variables, following the recommendation of having the initial sample size ten times the number of variables as suggested by Loeppky et al. [30]. Then, execute the simulator for each of the points. 3. Iterative Model Building: After obtaining the initial set of simulated data points, the workflow enters an iterative process of model building. This involves generating a set of surrogate models and estimating their accuracy using measure methods. Each model type has several hyperparameters that can be modified, and these hyperparameters are adjusted using a hyperparameter optimization technique. The process of building and optimizing models is iterated until the desired level of accuracy is achieved. When no further improvement can be made and the quality of the model is not sufficient, the sequential sampling routine is started. The measure method, such as cross-validation or an external validation test set, is pivotal in driving the optimization of model parameters, ensuring alignment with a specified error function (e.g., RRSE). 4. Termination Criteria: Throughout the iterative process, termination conditions are regularly checked. These conditions include meeting targets specified in the active measure, reaching the maximum running time, hitting the maximum number of samples, or exhausting the allowed modeling iterations. 5. Sequential sampling: the Sequential sampling approach involves the selection of new data point based on the information gathered so far. When the model's quality reaches a plateau and further improvements are challenging, the sequential sampling routine is activated. 6. Convergence and Termination: The iterative loop persists until the desired level of accuracy is achieved. At this point, the current best model is evaluated against the predefined targets in the enabled Measures. If the model satisfies all targets, signaling that the requirements are met, the toolbox gracefully terminates. 7. Optimization: the final metamodel is used to perform optimization and to identify the optimal design. We conducted our compilation using a computer with an Intel i3 processor and 4 Gb RAM. The surrogate models and adaptive sampling strategies were implemented using the Matlab programming language and the SUMO Toolbox [31]. For data collection, we utilized the TRNSYS building energy simulation tool. Simulations were performed to obtain the responses for each sample point in the dataset. These responses were then used as training data for the surrogate models. To generate data for training and validating the surrogate models, we employed the sequential sampling approach. Initially, we established an initial set of sample points to build the initial surrogate models. The number of initial samples was determined based on the number of design variables, following the recommendation of having the initial sample size as 10 times the number of variables. In our first case study, which had 2 parameters, we used 20 simulations as the initial set of samples. For the second case study, which had 6 parameters, we used 60 simulations as the initial set of samples. These initial samples were chosen to fill the entire domain evenly, ensuring that every point had an equal chance of being selected. We employed the LHS method as a design of experiment technique to achieve this even distribution. After building the initial surrogate model, we sequentially added new sample points using adaptive sampling strategies. The decision of adding new samples was based on an adaptive sampling criterion. The adaptive sampling process continued until a predefined number of samples had been used or a predetermined RRSE value was reached. To assess the performance of the surrogate models, we employed a cross-validation procedure. The dataset was divided into training and validation sets using a 5-fold cross-validation approach. We chose 5-fold cross-validation as it strikes a reasonable balance between robust evaluation and computational efficiency. It provides a good compromise by dividing the dataset into five subsets, using four for training and one for validation in each iteration. This allows us to obtain a more stable estimate of model performance. The performance of the models was measured using the RRSE metric, which quantified the level of agreement between the surrogate models and the TRNSYS simulation tool. The efficiency of the adaptive sampling strategies was assessed based on the number of model evaluations required to achieve the desired level of accuracy or improvement. Lower numbers of evaluations indicated a more efficient sampling strategy, as it reduced the computational burden and resource requirements. 3 Results and discussion A comparison of sampling strategies for generating surrogate models is presented in this section, considering two test cases. Four adaptive sampling methods based on ANN and Kriging are compared against a one-shot sampling using LHS. The relative efficiency metrics of these methods are discussed for the two test problems in the following paragraphs. The RRSE of case study 1 resulting models can be shown in Fig. 4 , with separate curves representing each strategy. Fig. 4 shows how the accuracy changes as the number of samples increases. The errors tend to be smaller as more samples are added. Initially, the information is restricted, and it is quite difficult to fit an accurate model. However, as more samples are generated, these differences flatten out, and the accuracy depends on the information gained from the infill sample. Fig. 4 allows also for an easy comparison of the performance of different sampling strategies for both Kriging and ANN models. It is expected that some strategies may perform better than others in terms of achieving lower RRSE values, indicating higher accuracy in model predictions. The figure can be used to identify the optimal sampling strategy for obtaining the most accurate model predictions with the lowest RRSE values. In the case of Kriging, which is a type of statistical interpolation technique, the accuracy of the model is expected to increase as more samples are added to the dataset. This is because Kriging relies on spatial autocorrelation, meaning that it uses nearby sample points to estimate values at un-sampled locations. Therefore, having more samples in different regions of the domain can lead to better model accuracy. Similarly, for ANN, which is a type of machine learning model, the accuracy is also expected to improve with more samples. This is because ANN learns patterns from data, and having more diverse samples allows the model to capture a wider range of patterns and relationships in the data, leading to improved accuracy. However, the rate at which the accuracy improves with increasing samples is varied depending on the specific sampling strategy used. It can be observed that the error-based strategy (Circle marker and Plus marker) achieves faster error convergence compared to Lola Voronoi (Diamond marker and Asterisk marker) and sample minimum strategies. This is because the former methods select points that have the potential to improve the model's accuracy the most, whereas the latter methods are based on a more heuristic approach. Regarding the curves representing Error based adaptive sampling, initially, with a small number of randomly selected samples, the model has limited information about the input space, resulting in a relatively high RRSE (0.8903 for the ANN model and 0.1908 for the Kriging model). However, as the model is iteratively updated with additional samples from regions with higher prediction errors, it potentially improves its accuracy by better capturing the underlying patterns in the data. This strategy is effective in refining the model in regions where the initial predictions were inaccurate, leading to a potentially lower RRSE (0.0093 for the ANN model and 0.0109 for the Kriging model) as the number of samples increases. The error-based sampling strategy selects samples based on their error values, giving higher priority to regions with higher errors. This results in faster convergence as the model focuses on areas that require more accurate predictions. On the other hand, Lola Voronoi-based sampling method divides the design space into regions based on the Voronoi tessellation and samples from the regions with larger cell sizes. Regarding the Sample Minimum Sampling (Triangle marker and Square marker), this strategy focuses on selecting samples from regions where the model predicts the lowest values, allowing the model to better capture the behaviour of the function in those regions. These strategies may require more iterations to adequately sample the design space and achieve accurate predictions, resulting in slower error convergence. Looking at the Expected improvement curve, this technique (dashdot linestyle) appears to show slower error convergence for this case study. This can be explained by the fact that the technique aims to sample around the point associated with the lowest output. In general, the adaptive methods, including error-based sampling, sample minimum, and LOLA Voronoi, with both Kriging and ANN models show faster error convergence compared to static sampling (solid and dashed linestyle), indicating their effectiveness in improving accuracy. These adaptive methods outperform the one-shot sampling Latin hypercube in terms of accuracy, indicating their potential for efficient and accurate sampling in the context of the case study. Achieving faster error convergence is recognized as a valuable attribute, potentially leading to more accurate metamodels with a reduced need for training samples. This efficiency gain holds significant implications for saving computational time and resources. However, faster convergence can sometimes lead to overfitting, where the metamodel becomes too closely tailored to the training data and loses its ability to generalize to new data. To mitigate the risk of overfitting, we have implemented a rigorous validation process in our methodology. A validation sample is employed to rigorously test the performance of our metamodels, ensuring that they maintain their accuracy and predictive power beyond the training data. The fitted model and the sample locations for the initial set and updated samples for case study 1 are presented in the graphs of Fig. 5 for the ANN model and Figs. 6 and 7 for the Kriging model. These figures show how the initial set of samples is distributed in the input space and how the updated samples from the different sampling strategies are added to the input space over iterations. The samples are represented as points and the fitted models are visually represented as a surface plot, showing the predicted values over the input space. The surface plot reveals the patterns and trends in the data as captured by the model. Regarding the overall behaviour of the resulting models, it can be seen that it appears quite similar. Looking at the sample positions, both models using static sampling have samples that fill up the entire domain of the variables, as seen in Figs. 5(a) and 6(a). This is particularly useful when we want to explore the behaviour of a model. Looking at the ANN model-based Error criterion (Fig. 5(b)) and Kriging model-based Error criterion (Fig. 6(b)), the update samples are added on the boundary which helps to improve the accuracy of the models in those regions. Error-based sampling selects the next sample point based on the error of the model at the current sample point. The infill sample is added to the set of samples by evaluating the model at the selected point and updating the error function. As can be seen from Figs. 5(c) and 6(c), Both methods have placed several samples on the boundary, since the LOLA Voronoi aims to minimize the maximum prediction error within each Voronoi region, the method ensures that the prediction error is minimized in the regions closest to the boundary, thus improving the overall accuracy of the surrogate model. Figs. 5(d) and 6 (d) show that the updated samples from the Sample Minimum are concentrated in regions where the models predict the lowest values of the objective function (annual thermal load). Therefore Sample Minimum sampling technique can provide a surrogate model with high accuracy close to the optimum area. Expected Improvement, as seen in Fig. 7, relies on the idea that the samples with the highest Expected Improvement are selected as the infill points. Analyzing the cost function with regard to RRSE in Fig. 4 (dashdot linestyle), this technique appears to pick interesting samples near the optimal area. Table 4 presents the results of optimization for different sampling configurations, using both ANN and Kriging models. Simulation-based NSGA-II optimization technique also complies for the comparison. The NSGA-II algorithm is executed with a population size (pop) of 20 and 50 generations (gen). The results are evaluated based on RRSE, which is a measure of the accuracy of the final fitted model, and the Energy Consumption function, which is the objective function being optimized. The table shows that the adaptive ANN optimization outperforms the static one in all cases, with the sampling budget fixed at 100 samples. The RRSE value for ANN-based optimization with static sampling is 0.0182, while for Kriging-based optimization with static sampling, it is 0.0114. The corresponding EC values are 89.70 for ANN and 90.62 for Kriging. This indicates that the adaptive sampling approach used with ANN-based optimization is more effective in exploring the design space and finding better solutions. Moreover, the results obtained using the ANN-based optimization approach are very close to the results obtained using the simulation-based NSGA-II optimization with a larger sampling budget of 1000 samples. This indicates that the adaptive sampling approach used in the ANN-based optimization can achieve comparable results to the traditional simulation-based optimization but with a significantly smaller number of samples. Among the other approaches, the Kriging-based error sampling and based Lola Voronoi approaches perform relatively better than the based sample minimum approach, in terms of achieving lower RRSE values and more optimal energy consumption function values. The RRSE value for ANN-based optimization with sample minimum-based criterion is 0.0074, while for Kriging-based optimization with sample minimum-based criterion, it is 0.0188. The corresponding EC values are 91.09 for ANN and 91.76 for Kriging. However, these approaches are still outperformed by the adaptive ANN-based optimization approach. It is also worth noting that the performance of the Kriging-based error sampling approach is quite consistent across different sampling criteria, while the performance of the based Lola Voronoi approach varies more significantly. This suggests that the Kriging-based error sampling approach may be more robust and reliable for building optimization problems, while the based Lola Voronoi approach may require more careful selection and tuning of the sampling criterion to achieve optimal results. The error-based sampling method, particularly within the Kriging framework, has shown advantages in terms of consistency and reliability. Its stable performance across different sampling criteria positions it as a robust choice for building optimization problems. However, it is essential to acknowledge potential drawbacks, such as the assumption that regions with higher errors are crucial for model refinement. This assumption may lead to a focused exploration of specific areas, potentially overlooking other equally important regions in the design space. Additionally, the method's performance may vary depending on the characteristics of the underlying function and the nature of the optimization problem. Therefore, the results presented in Table 4 provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of different sampling criteria and surrogate models for building optimization problems and highlight the advantages of the adaptive ANN-based optimization approach with adaptive sampling for this case study. Fig. 8 shows the RRSE convergence for the adaptive sampling approaches for case study 2 with static ANN and Static kriging model as references. Similar to the analyses of case study 1, this Figure allows to compare the performance of different sampling strategies for Kriging and ANN models in terms of their ability to accurately predict model outcomes. The figure shows how the accuracy, as measured by the RRSE, changes with increasing numbers of samples for each sampling strategy. The figure helps identify the optimal sampling strategy for obtaining the most accurate model predictions with the lowest RRSE values. The figure also demonstrates how adding more diverse samples can improve the accuracy of both Kriging and ANN models. A useful metric for assessing the performance of adaptive sampling methods in optimization problems is the percentage savings in the number of samples required to achieve the same accuracy as a traditional static sampling approach. This metric provides valuable information on the potential reduction in sample budget and time required to build an accurate model. It quantifies the extent to which adaptive sampling methods can improve efficiency by achieving comparable accuracy with fewer samples. Fig. 8 demonstrates that the Adaptive ANN methods offer a significant improvement over the traditional static approach, with savings of 68 %, 42 % and 47 %, using Error based sampling, Lola Voronoi-based sampling and Sample minimum-based sampling, respectively. Additionally, the figure reveals that the Kriging model using Sample minimum based sampling and Expected Improvement based sampling methods can achieve the same level of accuracy as the static approach with 25 % and 60 % fewer samples, respectively, while Error based sampling and Lola Voronoi-based sampling have slow convergence. The corresponding RRSE are 0.2223 and 0.1922 for Error based sampling and Lola Voronoi-based sampling, respectively. The convergence rate of adaptive sampling approaches can be affected by various factors. For instance, the dimensionality of the problem. The required number of samples grow exponentially with dimensions. Furthermore, the trade-off between local exploitation and global exploration greatly influences the performance of adaptive sampling. If the balance between these two conflicting parts is not properly maintained, the convergence rate can be affected [32].In practical BPO, slow convergence can be a significant challenge, as it can increase the time and computational resources required to generate accurate surrogate models. This can make it difficult to use surrogate models for building design applications, where fast and accurate predictions are required. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the choice of sampling strategy and to balance the trade-offs between accuracy, computational cost, and convergence speed when generating surrogate models. Table 5 presents the results of the optimization for a building optimization problem with six design variables presented in Table 2 and a maximum sample budget of 400 samples. The table presents the results obtained from the optimization process using different sampling configurations, surrogate models (ANN and Kriging), and the simulation-based NSGA-II optimization technique. The NSGA-II algorithm is executed with a population size of 20 and 50 generations. The evaluation of the results is based on two key metrics: RRSE of the final fitted model, and the Life cycle cost (LCC) function, which serves as the objective function for optimization. Similar to the previous case study with two design variables, the adaptive ANN-based optimization approach outperforms the static ANN-based optimization approach in all cases. The results demonstrate that the adaptive sampling strategy employed in the ANN-based optimization approach is effective in exploring the larger design space and finding better solutions, even with a limited sample budget (with samples saving to achieve the same level of accuracy as the static approach) compared to simulation-based NSGA-II (corresponding LCC is 70.63 $/m2). This highlights the advantage of using adaptive sampling to make efficient use of the available samples and achieve comparable results to traditional simulation-based optimization methods, which typically require a larger sample budget. The adaptive sampling strategy optimizes the allocation of samples to ensure efficient resource utilization. It avoids wasteful sampling in regions that are unlikely to contribute significantly to improving the solutions and directs the computational effort towards areas that are more likely to yield better results. By making efficient use of the limited sample budget, the strategy maximizes the chances of finding better solutions. The corresponding LCC are 74.07 $/m2, 80.54 $/m2, 82.05 $/m2 and 76.80 $/m2 for ANN-based static sampling, ANN-based error criterion, ANN-based LV criterion and ANN-based sample minimum criterion, respectively. Comparing the performance of different approaches, the Kriging-based error sampling and based Lola Voronoi approaches show relatively better results with LCC values of 77.52 $/m2 and 74.36 $/m2, respectively, compared to the based sample minimum approach with LCC value of 78.65 $/m2. These approaches achieve lower RRSE values and more optimal values of the LCC function. However, similar to the previous case study, they are still outperformed by the adaptive ANN-based optimization approach. In terms of consistency, the Kriging-based EI sampling approach demonstrates a more stable performance across different sampling criteria with low RRSE (0.1722) and optimal LCC value (72.93 $/m2), suggesting its robustness and reliability for building optimization problems. On the other hand, the based Lola Voronoi approach exhibits more variability in its performance, indicating that careful selection and tuning of the sampling criterion may be necessary to achieve optimal results with this approach. The results presented in Table 5 provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of different sampling criteria and surrogate models for building optimization problems for case study 2. From the analysis above, the adaptive ANN-based optimization approach with adaptive sampling is the best choice in terms of result accuracy. This approach showcased its effectiveness in exploring the design space and achieving optimal results, even with a limited sample budget. 4 Study limitations It is essential to acknowledge and address the limitations encountered during this study. One notable challenge is the curse of dimensionality, which poses a significant hurdle to the optimization-based adaptive surrogate model. The exponential growth of the design space, computational demand, and required number of points with increasing dimensions can make the optimization problem intractable and the resulting surrogate model inaccurate and inefficient. While various techniques, such as dimensionality reduction and feature selection, have been proposed to overcome this limitation, they may introduce additional challenges that require careful consideration. Another limitation is the robustness of the resulting surrogate models against noisy data or outliers in the simulation data. In practice, errors, uncertainties, or outliers in the data can affect the accuracy and reliability of the surrogate model. Future research could explore the use of robust regression techniques or data cleaning methods to enhance the robustness of surrogate models developed using adaptive sampling. Furthermore, this study focuses exclusively on mono-objective optimization problems. Multi-objective optimization problems, which involve optimizing multiple conflicting objectives simultaneously, are common in the BPO applications. The use of surrogate models based adaptive sampling for multi-objective optimization can be challenging, as it requires balancing the trade-offs between accuracy and diversity of the surrogate model. Therefore, further work is needed to extend the adaptive sampling strategies presented in this paper to multi-objective optimization problems. 5 Conclusions and future works For the purpose of building energy performance design, traditional approaches often rely on computationally expensive building energy simulation tools. One alternative is the use of surrogate models or metamodels. Surrogate models are computationally cheaper and faster to evaluate and can be used to find the optimal building envelope configurations. However, the collection cost associated with simulation samples to obtain an accurate model remains substantial. Sequential sampling strategies offer a promising approach to tackle this challenge by iteratively selecting sample points that enhance the accuracy of surrogate models. The adaptive sampling criterion employed in these strategies significantly influences the overall performance making it crucial to select an appropriate criterion. Despite the widespread use of surrogate models in the field of building performance optimization such as artificial neural networks (ANN) and Kriging. Concerns persist regarding their accuracy when employed with different sampling infill criteria. Additionally, while ANN-based surrogate models have gained popularity, a comparative analysis with the well-established Kriging model is lacking especially in the context of sequential sampling. This study addresses this gap by comparing the performance of ANN and Kriging models in conjunction with different sampling criteria. Indeed in this work, A typical building in Ben Guerir City in Morocco was chosen as the case study to ensure practical relevance. The outcomes of this research advanced the understanding of adaptive sampling strategies and their impact on surrogate model accuracy. By comparing ANN and Kriging models with various sampling criteria, this study provided valuable insights into the sampling/accuracy relationship. The results can aid in optimizing energy consumption in buildings while minimizing the computational effort required, leading to sustainable design and improved resource utilization. This study concluded that the adaptive ANN-based optimization approach with adaptive sampling emerged as the top-performing method. This approach demonstrated its ability to effectively explore the design space and achieve superior results even with a limited sample budget. The findings from this analysis can guide future optimization studies in the field of building design and emphasize the advantages of using adaptive sampling in conjunction with ANN-based optimization techniques. By using these techniques, designers can more quickly and accurately explore the design space and optimize their designs. This can lead to improved building performance, reduced development time and lower costs. Additionally, the use of surrogate models can facilitate the integration of building design with other disciplines, such as energy systems design, to achieve a more holistic and optimized design. The findings of this paper have important implications for the field of building design and can contribute to the development of more efficient and effective design processes.

However, accurate metamodels often require extensive evaluations, leading to high computational costs. Adaptive sampling approaches offer a promising solution by constructing accurate surrogate models at a lower computational expense compared to static sampling. The selection of an appropriate adaptive sampling criterion is crucial in sequential sampling strategies, as it determines how new sample points are chosen based on previous iterations. However, concerns remain regarding the impact of the sampling infill criterion on surrogate model accuracy. Additionally, a lack of studies exists comparing artificial neural networks (ANN) and Kriging models in terms of potential computational improvements through sequential sampling. This study aims to explore the potential of adaptive sampling strategies to estimate optimal building energy consumption within a reasonable computational budget, thus reducing the number of energy simulation model runs required. Furthermore, a comprehensive comparison between sequential sampling techniques employing ANN-based and Kriging-based surrogate models is conducted. Four different sampling criteria are evaluated to understand the relationship between sampling strategies and accuracy. The findings contribute to a more efficient resolution of building optimization problems. The results indicate that the choice of a sampling strategy depends on the model's requirements and the specific problem. Each strategy has distinct strengths and weaknesses, necessitating careful consideration of the model's needs. Selecting the appropriate sampling strategy improves model accuracy and reduces training time. Adaptive sampling methods yield significant improvements, saving 25 %\u201368 % of simulation samples compared to static approaches.",
