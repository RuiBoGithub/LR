Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Hong Kong China Air conditioners in residential buildings often rely on local feedback control to regulate the indoor temperature, where the unit is cycled on and off by comparing the actual temperature with the temperature set-point. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a technique that makes use of building models, disturbance forecasts, and optimization algorithms to enhance building performance. MPC has demonstrated its potential in reducing building energy consumption and operating costs; however, it has seldom been applied in residential buildings because of the high implementation costs, complicated hardware configuration, and insufficient data. In this study, we developed and tested a MPC controller in a real apartment aimed at reducing the operating costs based on the local Time-of-Use (ToU) utility structure. We developed a feasible and easy-to-use hardware configuration as well as a cloud-based software deployment. The MPC controllers were implemented and evaluated through one-month field testing in a bedroom and living room of an apartment in a residential building. The field test showed that the MPC controller saved 22.1% for the bedroom and 26.8% cooling costs for the living room, compared to conventional rule-based control (RBC). We further confirmed the robustness of the MPC controller as the field test showed that the MPC controller is able to outperform the conventional RBC controller, even if the model is not accurate. Our work provides a practical MPC solution that can unlock the load flexibility potential of residential buildings, which creates a win\u2013win solution for the households and the grid: saving utility costs for households and helping the grid to manage the balance between supply and demand.

Nevertheless, buildings have large potential for load shifting. It was estimated that the load shifting potential of residential buildings in the US can be up to 17.4 GW in 2030, compared to the 15.9 GW potential for commercial buildings [2]. Additionally, US retail electricity sales to the residential areas comprised 38.5 % in 2018, amounting to 1.46 trillion kWh, the largest among the commercial, industrial, and transportation sectors [3]. In the European Union, residential need accounted for an estimated 25% of the total energy consumption in 2011 [4]. Unlocking the energy efficiency and load flexibility potential of residential buildings can greatly contribute to the carbon emission reduction goal. A common approach to reduce building energy consumption is to retrofit the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system and building envelopes, which is expensive and takes a long time. Compared with the two measures mentioned above, upgrading the control strategy is less expensive but also effective for buildings [5\u20137]. The \u201cplug-and-play\u201d solution that can be well integrated with the existing building automation system is the most welcome as it requires little to no hardware retrofits. Model predictive control (MPC) is a control technique that makes use of building models, disturbance forecasts, and optimization algorithms to enhance building performance. By predicting future system behavior and the impact of anticipatory control action, MPC has the ability to handle constraints on manipulating variables and time delays in the system response, as well as to guarantee occupants\u2019 comfort. A comprehensive review of the MPC and the factors affecting its performance were presented in [8], demonstrating that MPC performs better compared to other control approaches, e.g., classical on/off or proportion-integration-differentiation (PID) control, nonlinear control, and adaptive fuzzy-neural control. Another review [9] also showed that MPC performs better in terms of energy use, cost savings, the ability to shift peak loads, and robustness to dynamic disturbances. MPC has demonstrated its potential in reducing building energy consumption, operational costs and peak demand in existing studies. Drgoňa et al. developed a white-box MPC for an office building in Belgium, which was equipped with is equipped with a ground source heat pump and thermally activated building structures. The MPC controller is deployed on the cloud and achieved 54% energy saving and 37% thermal comfort improvement [10]. Bengea et al. developed a MPC controller for a variable volume, dual-duct, multi-zone HVAC system serving an existing mid-size commercial building, which reduced the operating costs by 70% during the heating season [11]. Kim et al. developed and deployed a MPC controller to coordinate multiple roof top units for medium-sized commercial buildings, and reduced the peak load by 43% during the transition season [12]. 1.1 MPC for residential buildings Due to the large energy saving and load shifting potential, applying MPC in residential buildings has attracted increasing research attention in recent years. To generate the optimal dynamic temperature set-point profiles for the zone air and buffer tank water, Afram et al. [13] developed the supervisory MPC for a residential HVAC system based on artificial neural network (ANN) models. The MPC controller was able to reduce running costs by up to 73% as compared to the fixed set-point without compromising the thermal comfort requirements. Instead of adjusting temperature set-points using the conventional rule-based demand response (DR) control strategies, Hu and Xiao [14] used MPC techniques to directly control the operating frequencies of variable-speed air conditioners. Simulation results showed that the MPC controller can successfully improve thermal comfort at the beginning of occupied periods, shift the peak power demands, reduce overall energy consumptions, and save electricity costs. Pratt et al. [15] developed a simulation system with hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) technology intended to evaluate the performance of MPC controllers. The simulation results presented that all the components of the HIL simulation system could work together seamlessly and the overall system behavior was consistent with expectations. Lefort et al. [16] proposed a hierarchical control structure based on MPC for managing energy in residential buildings. The developed technique was compared with a classical control structure in a simulation case study, and achieved the lower utility costs and better thermal comfort. Pedersen et al. [17] investigated how economic MPC schemes for space heating operation can utilize the thermal mass in an existing residential apartment block. Compared to a conventional proportion-integration (PI) controller, the economic MPC schemes saved 6% operational costs and reduced 3% CO2 emissions as a function of increasing energy efficiency. Additionally, several studies have concentrated on testing MPC performance in real residential buildings. Afram and Janabi-Sharifi [18] designed a MPC controller to shift the heating and cooling load of a house to off-peak hours and generate the temperature set-points trajectory for on/off controllers. By using the MPC controller instead of a fixed set-point of 25 °C, operating costs were reduced by at least 16%. When the MPC-based centralized controller was compared with the fixed zone temperature set-point of 24 °C, more significant savings of nearly 50% were observed. Finck et al. [19] implemented an MPC using an ANN model in a residential building. The ANN-MPC was successfully tested and demonstrated good performance in predicting the building\u2019s energy consumption. Knudsen et al. [20] reported on an experiment where a novel economic MPC setup was applied for thermostatically control of a hydronic radiator in a highly-insulated residential building. The economic MPC consumed 1.3% more energy than a constant setpoint baseline controller, but in turn, it reduced operational costs by 22.5%. Pandey et al. [21] explored the possibility of implementing anticipatory thermal comfort-driven model predictive control in residential split air conditioners. The field test data demonstrate that the suggested controller saves 5% energy costs compared with the existing RBC. Moreover, the developed MPC controller delivered a more comfortable indoor environment by controlling the indoor air temperature within a narrower band and, with fewer fluctuations. Bünning et al., Huber et al. [22\u201324] implemented MPC using different modelling techniques, including physics-informed Autoregressive Moving Average with Extra Input (ARMAX) models, Random Forests models, and state-space models. When compared to a conventional hysteresis controller, the applied MPC controllers saved 24.9 % ∼ 49 % of cooling energy and 26 % of heating energy, while reducing comfort violations by 72.0 % in experiments. Kuboth et al. [25] presented 120 h experiments to compare the model predictive controller with a standard controller for an air source heat pump in a detached house. The results showed an average increase of the heat pump coefficient of performance of 22.2%, an average increase of 234.8% in terms of photovoltaic energy self-consumption as well as a resulting average heat pump operational cost reduction of 34.0% by the application of MPC. Amato et al. [26] reported on an economic MPC field experiment aimed at realizing the load shifting of space heating in a single-family house. The results indicated that it was possible to load shift heating consumption in the rooms with remote-controlled thermostats and sensors, but that the load shift for the building as a whole was limited due to the hydronics of the radiator system. Despite great research efforts being placed on investigating the MPC performance in residential buildings, there is still limited number of research studies on field implementation, for three reasons. First, residential buildings usually do not have building automation systems (BAS), since the cost savings opportunities relative to implementation costs have been small. The absence of BAS makes MPC\u2019s supervisory control more difficult to be executed by the HVAC devices. Second, the thermal inertia of residential buildings is usually less than commercial buildings [27], making them more vulnerable to internal or external disturbances. More field case studies are needed to evaluate the MPC performance. Last, modelling is a critical prerequisite for a successful implementation of MPC in buildings [28,29], because the control process will react to the prediction of input changes or other disturbances [30]. The availability of monitoring data in the commercial buildings allows the development of more accurate models. However, in residential buildings, the lack of sensing and data storage infrastructure leads to insufficient data for model development and MPC implementation. 1.2 Scope and objectives In this paper, we propose and demonstrate the development of an MPC controller for a residential building in Shenzhen, China, with the objective of reducing energy cost while maintaining thermal comfort. Our work aims to address three research questions. The first question concerns the hardware infrastructure and sensing requirements. This study proposes a feasible, affordable and easy-to-use hardware configuration for an MPC controller in a residential building with only a few additional devices installed. The second question is about the performance and cost saving potential of MPC in residential buildings. To evaluate the performance of the MPC controller, we compare the comfort and cost of the developed MPC with the existing rule-based control (RBC) using the field test data. The last question deals with the impact of model accuracy on MPC performance. Since there is insufficient data available in residential buildings, we develop three versions of MPC with different model accuracy levels and then compare their performances. The rest of the paper is structured as follow: Section 2 introduces the details about the implementation of the MPC controller, including the hardware configuration, MPC formulation (cost function, constraints and system models) and the field test protocol. The results of field experiments are reported in Section 3, where we evaluate the comfort and cost performance of MPC. The impact of model accuracy, contribution and limitation of our work are discussed in Section 4 before we conclude in Section 5. 2 Method 2.1 Target building and field test protocol The target building is a rediential apartment located in Shenzhen, China, where cooling is needed in the hot summer [31]. In this field study, we developed MPC controllers to optimize the operation of the air conditioners in the master bedroom and living room, respectively. The major difference between the bedroom and living room is the window in the living room is larger than that in the bedroom. Therefore, the living room is more significantly influenced by the solar radiation rather than the bedroom. The thermal properties of the target building was unknown to us, which is often the case when implementing advanced controllers in real buildings. To address this issue, we needed to estimate the building thermal properties through parameter identification approaches using historical data. Based on the local building code, the design U values of the opague and transparent envelopes should be less than 0.7 W/(m2 K) and 3.5 W/(m2 K) respectively. Cooling is provided to the bedroom and living room, each with a constant-frequency split air conditioners. The parameters of the air conditioners are summarized in Table 1 . The design cooling capacity of each air conditioner is 2650 W and 3510 W, respectively. The nominal power consumption of each air conditioner is 555 W and 810 W, respectively. The field test plan is plotted in Fig. 1 . To guarantee that the MPC and RBC were tested under similar weather conditions for fair comparison, we alternated the execution of MPC and RBC every other week between 1st September to 30th September 2022. The test plan was similar to the approach adopted in Ref. [29]. Our experiment were conducted between 9am and 5 pm on working days only, excluding weekends and holidays (Mid-autumn Festival in early September). The comfort temperature band is constant set between 24 and 26 °C for both RBC and MPC, as shown in Table 2 . In total, the two split air condintioners were controlled by MPC for 12 days and by RBC for 9 days. As explained in Section 1.2, one research question of this study is the impact of data availability and model accuracy on the MPC\u2019s performance. Therefore, we developed three versions of the MPC with different model accuracy levels. Version 1 MPC was trained on the 6th day of the experiment using only the operating data of the first five days that were generated by the RBC controller. Version 2 MPC was developed using 3 weeks of operating data generated from 2 weeks of RBC operation and 1 week of MPC operation. Both Version 1 and Version 2 of MPC did not consider solar radiation in the thermal dynamics model because the solar radiation sensor is usually unavailable for residential settings. However, in Version 3 MPC, we considered the solar radiation in our model, which was trained on 28th September. The detailed field test protocol is shown in Fig. 1. 2.2 Hardware configuration An easy-to-use and low-cost hardware configuration is proposed in this study. It is applied in the bedroom and living room as presented in Fig. 2 . The key hardware components of our MPC solution is the Tuya smart air conditioner socket, which is able to control the air conditioner operation remotely, and also record the operation state and power consumption of the air conditioner unit. Additionally, temperature sensors and a wifi gateway are installed in each room. The temperature sensors with accuracy of ± 0.1℃ are installed to measure the indoor temperature of bedroom and living room. The MPC controller is deployed on the cloud for easy maintenance and monitoring, and receives sensed indoor thermal state, weather forecasts and Time-of-Use (ToU) tariff, optimizes the air conditioner operation and sends optimized control actions to the Tuya smart air conditioner socket using Tuya API, which then sends the air conditioner control signal to the split air conditioner unit using infrared communication. The Tuya smart air conditioner socket can communicate with almost all split air conditioner units that can be controlled by infrared remote controllers. In other words, the Tuya smart air conditioner socket serves as a communication gateway between our controller and the air conditioner. The centralized server automatically design and solve the necessary optimization problems for each of the control optimization and state estimation in a Python environment. The server receives data collected by the sensors from the room and air contioners, storing them in the project database for later use by the MPC algorithms. Separate Python instances are created for data communication and control optimization for each air conditioner. An HTTP RESTful application programming interface (API) is used to retrieve data from specified points associated with the operation of the air conditioners. For the site weather data, we use an HTTP RESTful API provided called ALICLOUD [32] to obtain data from a weather station located in Shenzhen. In summary, the two rooms in the proposed control infrastructure is configured in a modularized way, making it simple to manage and update an advanced control algorithm and to reduce capital expenses for MPC implementation. 2.3 MPC formulation 2.3.1 Modelling and parameter estimation The first step of MPC is to develop a model that can predict the thermal state of the conditioned room given different control actions and uncontrolled disturbances. The heat balance approach, which explicitly predicts the rate of heat transfer to the interior and external surfaces as well as to the zone air based on the law of energy conservation, is commonly used to anticipate the thermal dynamics of each room. To determine the node temperature and the flow of heat between connected nodes, a thermal network of the building is created. The first-order thermal resistance\u2013capacitance network (RC) model is employed in this study because the optimization problem formulated from the first order RC model is convex, the global optimal of which is easy to find. As the living room and bedroom are controlled separated, RC models are developed for each room. Though the two rooms are neighboring, the temperature difference between these two rooms is small therefore we assume there is no heat transfer between these two rooms. The state parameter of RC model is derived as follows: (1) C d T z dt = T w - T z R + q HVAC + α × I solar where T z and T w represent the zone temperature and outdoor temperature, with units of K; C is the thermal capacitance of the zone and the envelopes, with units of K m2/W; R is the resistance to heat exchange between the outdoors and envelopes, with units of kJ kg/K; q HVAC is the cooling influx brought by the air conditioner, with units of W; I solar is the solar irradiation, with units of W/m2; and α is solar heat gain coefficient. T z is measured by indoor temperature sensors. T z and I solar are collected from local weather stations. R, C and α are parameters dertermined from the operating data. The discrete-time thermal dynamics of individual zone model with the control time step of 10 min can be rewritten from Eq.(1) in the following form: (2) x k + 1 = A d x k + B d u k + E d d k where xk is the state vector which represents the temperature of each room; uk is the control input representing the cooling capacity from the air conditioners and dk is the disturbance vector consisting of outside temperature, and the solar irradiation. Ad , Bd , Ed are the matrices of the discrete-time state space model depending on the sampling time. As mentioned in section 2.1, various version models are used to measure how the model accuracy affects the MPC performance. In MPC-1, the model is trained using 1 week of data, which accordingly has a low precision, whereas MPC-2 and MPC-3 models are developed using larger amounts of operating data, and therefore are considered to have higher levels of accuracy. Additionally, the solar irradiation is added to the MPC-3 model while it is not taken into account in the MPC-1 or MPC-2 models. It should be noted that MPC-3 is only implemented for the living room, because only the living room has a large window to wall ratio, and is significantly influenced by the solar heat gain. The thermal resistance R, thermal capacity C, and solar heat gain coefficient α are key building thermal properties that determine the model accuracy of the RC model. The value of R, C and α are identified from operating data using the Nelder-Mead optimization approach [33]. Fig. 3 shows comparisons of the predicted zone temperature with the measured temperature, and Table 3 shows the model accuracy of each version of MPC controller. The model of the bedroom was updated once, while the model of the living room was updated twice. The model accuracy of MPC-2 and MPC-3 has been significantly improved due to having more training data. However, introducing the solar irradiation does not really improve the model accuracy. This is partly because that the living room curtain was closed, and the solar irradiation does not have a large impact on the zone temperature. The air conditioner models consisting cooling capacity model and power consumption model. As the air conditioners are fixed-speed units, the cooling capacity and power consumption are assumed as constants. 2.3.2 Time-of-Use tariffs ToU pricing is the rate structure in which energy and peak power prices are time-dependent. ToU tariffs are frequently predetermined and do not change over a contract duration. Fig. 4 shows the actual ToU price implemented in Shenzhen. The period of valley load is defined as 00:00\u201308:00, totally 8 h; the period of rush load is defined as 11:00\u201312:00 and 15:00\u201317:00, totally 3 h; the period of peak load is defined as 10:00\u201311:00, 14:00\u201315:00 and 17:00\u201319:00, totally 4 h. The remaining time is the period of flat load. Adopting the actual price of electricity in the city, the prices of rush, peak, flat and valley load period are 1.3247 RMB/kWh, 1.0653 RMB/kWh, 0.6380 RMB/kWh and 0.2596 RMB/kWh. The aforementioned pricing structures are frequently taken into account as a part of demand response programs to incentize electricity end-users to shift the load from times when the grid is stressed to when the supply is abundant [34]. The MPC controller must be able to alter the cooling load in such a way that decreases the overall electricity costs under the ToU structure without compromising occupants\u2019 comfort and demand. 2.3.3 Weather forecast The MPC model's weather-related input variables are forecasted, and that is the responsibility of weather forecasting. ALICLOUD provides weather forecasts for a variety of meteorological parameters, including, among others, ambient temperature, humidity, and solar irradiation, in time steps of one hour and a prediction horizon of 12 h. A Python module has been developed to query, retrieve, reformat, and write weather forecast to the project database using the services' HTTP RESTful APIs. Fig. 5 plots a sample of forecast and measured weather data for the week starting 5th September. Although there are some temperature forecast errors in the figure, the solar radiation is very accurate. To meet the requirements of the MPC controller, linear interpolation is used to resample the ambient temperature and solar irradiation every 10 min. 2.3.4 Optimization formulation MPC is a control strategy that optimizes the control actions over a finite time horizon (defined as the prediction horizon) by anticipating the future disturbances to the system and avoiding future constraint violations. The optimal control problem is defined for the current time (t 0) until the end of the prediction horizon (tf ). The control horizon can be different from the prediction horizon. However, in this study, we assume they are the same. The formulated optimization problem is shown as follows: (3) [ obj ] : min u t , s 1 , s 2 ∫ t 0 t f p e t × u t × P r + ω 1 s 1 2 + ω 2 s 2 2 d t s.t. (4) [ C1a ] : x k + 1 = A d x k + B d u k + E d d k t ∈ t 0 , t f (5) [ C2a ] : x t 0 = x 0 (6) [ C3a ] : T z t - s 1 ⩽ T z u t ∈ t 0 , t f (7) [ C3b ] : T z t + s 2 ⩾ T z l t ∈ t 0 , t f (8) [ C4a ] : u t = 0 , 1 t ∈ t 0 , t f (9) [ C5a ] : s 1 , s 2 ⩾ 0 where x 0 is the initial state estimation by the state estimator; pe (t) refers to ToU tariffs, with units of RMB/kWh; Pr represents the rated energy consumption of air conditioners, with units of kWh. The objective is to minimize the weighted sum of the energy cost between the current time t 0 and end of the prediction horizon tf . The objective function implements soft comfort constraints rather than hard constraints to ensure the solver can always find feasible solutions. The upper and lower constraints on zone temperature are T z u = 26 °C and T z l = 24 °C with slack variables s 1, s 2 and corresponding weights w 1, w 2. For this field study, all hyper-parameters were tuned manually, and we selected 800 after testing different values. The control actions for the air conditioners are discrete variable 1 and 0 for on/off. To get the effect of on/off commands, we sent a low temperature setpoint (16 °C) when we wanted the air conditioner to be on and a high temperature setpoint (30 °C) when we wanted the air conditioner to be off. We used IPOPT to solve the formulated optimization problem [35], where IPOPT is a nonlinear optimization solver included in the CVXPY toolbox [36]. The control and prediction horizon was set to 2 h with a control time step of 10 min. We found this setting well managed the trade-off between accuracy of the weather prediction and a sufficient length of the prediction horizon. In this study, we adopted the receding horizon control approach as typical MPC controllers does, i.e. we optimize for multiple time steps, and implement the optimized control action for only the next time step. At the next time step, we collect the latest indoor temperature and weather forecast, to formulate a new optimization problem, and then solve this problem. So on and so forth. 2.4 RBC algorithm RBC determines the decision variables based on a predetermined fixed set of rules, which usually follows the structure of \u201cif condition, then action\u201d. The conditions and actions are usually associated with numerical parameters (e.g., threshold values). The performance of RBC largely depends on a good choice of rules and associated parameters [5]. In this study, we selected the RBC as shown in Fig. 6 , as the benchmark to evaluate the performance of the proposed MPC solution. The RBC strategy uses the indoor temperature as a feedback signal, and the air conditioners are controlled by comparing the indoor temperature with the thresholds T 1 and T 2. If the indoor temperature falls below T 1, the air conditioner is turned off. If the indoor temperature rises above T 2, the air conditioner is turned on. Otherwise, the air conditioners will be unchanged for the next control time step. 3 Results 3.1 Overall performance We first plot the ambient weather conditions during the field test periods in Fig. 7 , indicating the days when MPC is executed in green and the days when RBC is executed in red. The MPC field tests were conducted when the apartment was not occupied. Occupants were at home during weekends and holidays, and in those days, the field tests were paused. The outside air temperature drops at the end of the experiment period and the global horizontal solar irradiation remains stable during this period with the maximum value above 800 W/m2. Fig. 8 plots the daily cooling cost of the bedroom (Fig. 8a) and living room (Fig. 8b) versus daily average outdoor temperature for the entire field test periods. The daily cooling cost increases with higher daily mean outdoor air temperature for both the MPC and RBC controllers. It can be clearly observed that the MPC controllers outperform the RBC controller over entire experimental period with lower energy cost given similar outdoor temperatures. The cost saving mostly comes from the pre-cooling strategy adopted by the MPC controller when the electricity price is cheap. In addition to the operating costs, we also care about occupants\u2019 comfort. The zone discomfort for bedroom and living room is plotted in Fig. 9 . The zone-wise discomfort during the testing period, denoted as D d, is calculated as the integral of the temperature deviation from the comfort band ( T z u and T z l ) of each room, as shown in the equation below: (10) D d = ∫ t 0 t f max T z l - T z , 0 + max T z - T z u , 0 d t MPC is a model-based constrained optimal control method, so we adopt a linear state-space model that captures the building thermodynamics for efficiently responding to exogenous factors. It can be seen that the discomfort for the both bedroom and living room under MPC varies in narrow ranges, compared to the RBC controller. As observed in Fig. 8, MPC suffers less from over-cooling, especially in the bedroom. Overcooling in summer leads to unnecessary cooling energy consumption and reduced indoor satisfaction level [37], which should be avoided in air conditioner operation. It is worth noting that comfort violation of MPC is more frequent and intense for the living room. The reason is the living room has a larger window to wall ratio and therefore is more significantly influenced by the solar heat gain. As a result, the living room suffers more from the inaccurate model than the bedroom, when the solar radiation is not considered in the thermal balance model (as in MPC-1 and MPC-2). The unmeasured and unconsidered disturbance (solar radiation) leads to a larger degree of the comfort violation, as shown in Fig. 8. Fig. 10 compares the average daily cooling cost and comfort violation of the MPC and RBC controllers. The results show that the MPC controllers save cooling costs of 22.1% and 26.8% for bedroom and living room, respectively. In terms of comfort, the MPC controller in the bedroom can achieve 24% discomfort savings. However, the living room\u2019s discomfort level will increase because we did not measure the solar radiation when implementing MPC. The unmeasured solar radiation will lead to comfort violation, and this impact is more significant for the living room, because the living room has a larger window than the bedroom. 3.2 Optimized action To determine where the cost savings of MPC come from, we delve deeply into the optimized control action of MPC versus RBC. Figs. 11 and 12 show the detailed control actions of air conditioner and resulting indoor temperature variations with MPC and RBC controllers during two representative days with similar ambient weather conditions. The selected days were 6th September (controlled by MPC) and 16th September (controlled by RBC), 2022. The average outdoor temperature on 16th September was slightly higher than that on 6th September, while the average solar radiation on 16th September was almost same as that on 6th September. As shown in Fig. 11 (for the bedroom) and 12 (for the living room), the MPC and RBC controllers are both able to avoid the comfort violation, with the indoor temperature maintained within 24 °C and 26 °C during the majority of the day. However, the indoor temperature between 9:00AM and 9:30AM was higher than the upper bound, because the initial indoor temperature when the air conditioner was turned on was too high, and required about 30 min for the indoor temperature to cool down. It can be observed that the proposed MPC controllers take into account the ToU electricity price when selecting the optimal control actions, taking the advantage of price fluctuation to reduce utility costs while guaranteeing thermal comfort using the pre-cooling strategy when the electricity price is relatively cheap and is about to increase as shown in the shaded area. However, the RBC control logic does not consider the ToU pricing signal when determining its control action. It also can be observed that the air conditioner in the living room was turned on for a longer period of time, partly due to the larger window to wall ratio of the living room and the resulting larger heat gains. Note that the air conditioner controlled by MPC was turned on and off more frequently. This was due to the receding horizon control scheme adopted by the MPC controller, which updated the control action at each control time step based on the most recent information collected by the environmental sensors. This feedback mechanism improved the robustness of MPC when the model and forecasts were less accurate at the cost of control action fluctuations. It can be expected that the control action will be less bumpy with increased model accuracy. 4 Discussion 4.1 Model accuracy and MPC performance A key research question of this study is how robust the MPC approach is to model uncertainty. To answer this question, we compared the performance of each version MPC to analyze the impact of model accuracy on MPC performance. The room temperature distributions under MPC controllers for bedroom and living room are plotted in Fig. 13 . The room temperature of MPC-1 varied in a large range because of the less accurate model. The date of 7th September and 22rd September sufferd from larger temperature variation because of the data communication problems. The indoor temperatures controlled by MPC-2 and MPC-3 varied in a narrower range, especially for the living room. It can be concluded that a more accurate model leads to better temperature control with narrower fluctuations. We compared the detailed indoor temperature variations of the two versions of MPC for the living room in Fig. 14 and the three versions of the MPC for the bedroom in Fig. 15 . The outdoor temperature of the selected days were slightly different. The outdoor temperature of MPC-1 was slightly higher than that of the other two days. However, the solar irradiation of three typical days was similar with the same trend. As can be seen, MPC developed from more accurate model can dramatically improve the controllability so that the fluctuations of indoor temperatures were much smaller for both bedroom and living room. In this study, we did not compare the cost savings of different versions of MPC for two reasons. First, the number of days that controlled by MPC-1, MPC-2 and MPC-3 were few, which cannot arrive at statistically robust conclusions. Second, the ambient conditions of MPC-1, MPC-2 and MPC-3 were not similar. As observed in Fig. 7, the cooling cost was a function of ambient weather condition. 4.2 Contributions The major contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows: (1) We propose a low-cost and easy-to-use hardware configuration for MPC implementation in residential buildings using the Tuya smart air conditioner socket. Our solution is low cost because it only requires installing a Tuya smart air conditioner socket and temperature sensors, both of which can be \u201cplug-and-play\u201d and are not expensive (with an estimated total cost of around 350 RMB). Our solution is generalizable because the Tuya smart air conditioner socket can communicate with almost all split air conditioner units that can be controlled by infrared remote controllers. (2) We demonstrate the cooling cost saving potential of the MPC controller in residential buildings by comparing its performance with existing RBC in a field test. Under the current ToU scheme, MPC saves around 25% operating costs compared with the existing RBC control strategy. The Guangdong local utility plans to further increase the peak to non-peak price ratio to accommodate higher adoption of renewable power generation. MPC has the potential to save even more in a larger peak to non-peak price ratio, and to more effectively help the grid shifting the HVAC load. (3) We analyze the impact of model uncertainty on MPC performance by developing three versions of MPC with different levels of model accuracy. We found less accurate models lead to more frequent comfort violations. The model accuracy can improve rapidly when more operating data were collected for model training. 4.3 Limitations and future work The fact that the MPC controller was only evaluated for a month presents a major limitation to our study. It is definitely better to evaluate the performance of the MPC controller over a whole year by conducting experiments throughout the whole cooling season, heating season, and transition seasons. The second limitation of this study is that the MPC controller was developed for a residential building located in the hot summer and warm winter climate zone in China. Future work to implement and test MPC in more residential buildings and other climate zones can help to demonstrate the generalizability and adaptiveness of MPC. In addition, our conclusion that MPC can outperform RBC even when the model is less accurate requires further investigation. Because model development is a fundamental step but a major bottleneck for the implementation of MPC [38]. More quantitative analysis based on larger sample sizes as well as theoretical proof are needed. Next, in this study, the occupant behavior is not considered and we assume the comfortable temperature band is unchanged. In the future, we plan to allow the users to freely adjust the indoor temperature range, which is helpful to test the flexibility of the MPC controller. We also observed a more frequent turning on and off behavior of the air conditioning for the MPC controller compared with the RBC, which may lead to a reduced life time of the air conditioner. To avoid this, we kept the air conditioner always running while adjusting the temperature set-point to turn on and off the cooling: when cooling is needed, we reduced the temperature set-point to 16 °C; while when cooling is not needed, we increased the temperature set-point to 30 °C. Additionally, we are considering adding a regularization term in the objective function to penalize the frequent change of the decision variable, which will be tested in the future. Last, we did not consider humidity in our MPC configuration, which may lead to humidity violations, especially in hot and humid regions. The major challenge associated with considering humidity in the MPC formulation is that the dehumidification process is non-linear and complicated. The current RC model is inadequate in handling the both the temperature and humidity balance. More research is needed in this regard. 5 Conclusions Despite the large number of MPC applications for building energy systems, few studies have been developed for air conditioners in residential buildings. The major barrier is the lack of a cost-effective and generalizable hardware configuration to implement MPC in residential buildings, as well as a lack of approaches to communicate with the air conditioner devices due to be the absence of building automation systems, and insufficient data for model training due to the absence of sensing networks. This study proposed and demonstrated a complete MPC solution for air conditioners in residential buildings. A cloud deployment and hardware configuration framework for the MPC controller was developed, which is low-cost and generalizable. The performance of the proposed MPC solution was tested in a residential building in Shenzhen, China for a month. The air conditioners in bedroom and living room were controlled by our MPC controller, which consistently saved 22.1% of cooling costs for the bedroom and 26.8% for the living room, compared to the existing RBC controller. Considering that residential buildings frequently suffer from the problem of insufficient data, we developed different versions of MPC to quantify the impact of model accuracy on MPC performance. We found that an MPC controller with less accuracy model can still outperform the conventional RBC controller. However, a more accurate model can improve the control performance so that the fluctuations of indoor temperatures are smaller. We also found that the MPC implemented with the 1R1C model trained from three weeks of operating data clearly outperform the existing RBC.

        "dc:description": "Air conditioners in residential buildings often rely on local feedback control to regulate the indoor temperature, where the unit is cycled on and off by comparing the actual temperature with the temperature set-point. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a technique that makes use of building models, disturbance forecasts, and optimization algorithms to enhance building performance. MPC has demonstrated its potential in reducing building energy consumption and operating costs; however, it has seldom been applied in residential buildings because of the high implementation costs, complicated hardware configuration, and insufficient data. In this study, we developed and tested a MPC controller in a real apartment aimed at reducing the operating costs based on the local Time-of-Use (ToU) utility structure. We developed a feasible and easy-to-use hardware configuration as well as a cloud-based software deployment. The MPC controllers were implemented and evaluated through one-month field testing in a bedroom and living room of an apartment in a residential building. The field test showed that the MPC controller saved 22.1% for the bedroom and 26.8% cooling costs for the living room, compared to conventional rule-based control (RBC). We further confirmed the robustness of the MPC controller as the field test showed that the MPC controller is able to outperform the conventional RBC controller, even if the model is not accurate. Our work provides a practical MPC solution that can unlock the load flexibility potential of residential buildings, which creates a win\u2013win solution for the households and the grid: saving utility costs for households and helping the grid to manage the balance between supply and demand.",
