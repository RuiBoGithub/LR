Many studies have applied OCCs to mechanical ventilation systems, while natural ventilation systems have gathered much less attention. The natural ventilation effect, driven by opening windows or vents, can be effective in improving indoor air quality, however, result in a leakage of interior heating energy in winter in cold climates. Therefore, the controls of thermostats and natural ventilation systems shall be designed well so that satisfying levels of thermal comfort, air quality and energy conservation can be simultaneously guaranteed. This study proposes an OCC and applies it to thermostats and natural ventilation systems for indoor thermal comfort, air quality and heating energy management. The strategy comprises three controllers: occupancy-based on-off controller, controller of setpoint of indoor air temperature and window openness controller. First, real-time profiles of heat gains from occupants and window openness were collected by employing vision-based detection. Second, a parametric building simulation study was conducted, and then simulation data were generated to develop predictive shallow artificial neural networks for forecasting the indoor conditions and energy performance of the investigated room. Third, the performance of the proposed strategy was examined. Compared to the baselines, the control could offer a decrease in building heating loads by between 43.4% and 63.8 % and an improvement of predicted mean vote levels by 0.36\u20130.37. The proposed OCC could also maintain indoor CO2 concentrations below 1000 ppm for about 91 % of the studied time, while 84.2 % of the time with several peaks over 3000 ppm in the baseline cases.

Over the last approximately fifteen years, the International Energy Agency (IEA) have launched three programmes on Energy in Buildings and Communities (EBC), namely Annex 53, Annex 66 and Annex 79 respectively, aiming at understanding and lowering building energy use. The Annex-53, entitled \u201cTotal energy use in buildings\u201d (2009\u20132013) had advanced the understanding and knowledge of building energy use and many building energy analysis and evaluation methods. It also demonstrated that occupant behavior is a key factor not only influencing building energy use, but also causing a divergence between the designed and real building energy use [2]. The findings from Annex-53 highlighted the importance of understanding occupant behaviour and stimulated further interest in studying it. Consequently, the Annex 66, entitled \u201cDefinition and simulation of occupant behaviour in buildings\u201d (2013\u20132017) was launched [3]. The project encompassed various aspects, including defining occupant behaviour, building tools for modelling occupant behaviour and investigating the implications of occupant behaviour for building energy and the indoor environment. The Annex-66 has suggested further coupling occupant behaviour with Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems for better serving the indoor environment and reducing building energy use. Subsequently, the Annex 79 entitled \u201cOccupant-Centric building design and operation\u201d (2018\u20132023) was initiated [4]. This programme aimed to enhance building energy performance and indoor thermal comfort by incorporating occupant behaviour in the building design and operation process. Because of the above three programmes, the knowledge of occupant behaviour have advanced considerably. A number of studies have managed to model occupant behaviour and obtained high accuracy over test datasets, however the adaptability and robustness of such prediction still require further examination across different datasets. After all, occupant behaviour is stochastic, complicated and multi-disciplinary. Recently, as the software and hardware in computer science become technically mature, various computer-science-aided approaches have been developed and used to capture real-time occupant behaviour and further produce occupant-related information. For instance, Lu et al. [5] extracted occupants' schedules from social media using a text classification algorithm. Lou et al. [6] obtained the patterns of the investigated occupants in the university canteen, dormitory, library and educational buildings by miscellaneous approaches, including video recording, sensors, payment records, curriculum schedules and access systems. Deng et al. [7] distinguished occupants\u2019 features and monitored occupant behaviour by using an integrated digital identification system. Among all the approaches, vision-based detection via cameras has gained great popularity. Rueda et al. [8] presented an extensive review of five collectors that were used to detect occupants, which were passive infrared, environmental sensors, smart meters, WIFI/Bluetooth and computer vision (CV) detection. The merits of CV detection included high occupant information resolution because CV detection is able to identify the state, quantity, activity, identity and track occupants with high accuracy, compared to the other four approaches. On the other hand, CV detection is relatively economical and computationally expensive and may cause privacy issues. Salimi and Hammad [9] systematically reviewed the types of occupants monitoring systems and classified them into six sub-types, including motion sensors, CV-based technology, RF-based technology, multi-sensor networks, virtual sensors and surveys. The authors showed that even though CV-based detection requires heavy image processing procedures, such an approach still has a high detection rate. Choi et al. [10] presented a structured review of the utilization of vision-based systems for sensing occupant-related information and how such information aids the operation of building control systems. The authors reported that vision-based systems typically have a fast response and high accuracy, thereby making it possible to produce dynamic occupant-related information for the further control and management of building systems. The authors also expected a rise in the application of such systems in the built environment in the future, with the advancement and development of CV techniques. 1.1 Literature review: computer-vision-based occupant-centric controls The availability of real-time information on occupant behaviour, obtained through CV detection methods, has not only exposed patterns of occupant behaviour in real environments but also shown good potential for reducing building energy consumption and enhancing building energy efficiency and indoor thermal conditions. This is achieved by employing occupant-centric controls (OCCs), which leverage sensed information on occupant behaviour to manage or fine-tune the operation of HVAC systems actively. Numerous researchers have collected occupant-related information using CV detection methods and further applied the proposed OCCs to HVAC systems for building energy and indoor climate management. The following reviews recent studies and categorizes them into three key areas: the utilization of OCCs in thermostats, mechanical ventilation systems, and naturally-ventilated as well as mix-mode buildings. ● Application of CV-based OCCs to thermostats Thermostats are simple devices effective in controlling Indoor Air Temperature (IATs). In winter, a thermostat will switch a heating system on to provide interior heat once the IAT is lower than the setpoint. Several studies have collected occupant-related information using CV-based detection approach and further applied the proposed OCCs to thermostats to offer or optimize indoor thermal comfort. For instance, Wang et al. [11] monitored the posture of occupants and evaluated their discomfort states. Afterwards, an OCC was designed to change the setpoint of IATs between 20 °C and 30° every 15 min in response to the monitored occupants' posture. The experimental results showed that the designed control strategy offered personalized thermal satisfaction to occupants. In the work by Li and Chen [12], a novel OCC based on vision-based detection was developed for personalized thermal comfort. First, vision-based detection was used to classify the clothing level of surveyed occupants. Second, a predictive model was developed to map the relationship between occupants' clothing level and comfortable air temperature. Third, long-wave-infrared cameras were deployed to obtain the facial skin temperature of occupants. Fourth, the proposed OCC adjusted the setpoint temperature according to whether occupants' facial skin temperature dropped in the derived comfortable temperature based on their clothing levels. The experimental tests showed that 91 % of the subjects felt neutrally thermal comfortable. Choi et al. [10] estimated the real-time occupants' clothing insulation level in an experiment chamber by means of applying vision-based detection and designed an OCC for regulating the setpoint of IATs in response to the estimated clothing level. In the designed OCC strategy, the estimated occupants' clothing level was used to evaluate occupancy PMV indexes, and then optimizations were conducted in order to determine the optimal indoor air temperature. The determined optimal IAT, functioning as an ideal setpoint of IATs, was delivered to an IoT air conditioning for IATs control. The experimental results indicated that the OCC strategy significantly reduced the percentage of occupants' sensation of cool and holistically improved thermal comfort level. Similarly, an OCC was established for indoor thermal comfort control in the work by Choi et al. [10]. First real-time occupants' clothing insulation level and metabolic rate were collected by using vision-based approach. Second, given the measured occupants' clothing insulation level and metabolic rate, predicted mean vote models were used to derive optimal IATs, which were regarded as the target setpoint temperature of IATs. Third, the derived setpoint temperature was sent to an air conditioner for regulating IATs. The experiments revealed that such control strategy reduced occupants\u2019 sensation of cooler, compared to fixed setpoint control, where setpoint temperature was set to be 26 °C. The above studies have proposed OCCs and modified the setpoint of IATs concerning the level of occupants' thermal satisfaction. The setpoint of IATs can influence not only occupants' thermal satisfaction, but also building energy loads. Therefore, a number of studies managed to optimize the setpoint of IATs for better indoor thermal comfort and energy conservation simultaneously. For instance, Jung et al. [13] proposed an OCC for providing indoor thermal comfort and maintaining energy performance. First, the activity levels of the investigated occupants (seated, walking, and handling 50 kg load) were sensed by making use of vision-based detection approaches. Second, by feeding the sensed activity level into a specific reinforcement-learning controller, optimal IATs were determined, which balanced the trade-off relationship between the level of occupants' thermal satisfaction and the energy use of the active systems in the test chamber. The experimental results revealed that the proposed OCC reduced occupants\u2019 thermal dissatisfaction by 10.9 %, whilst maintaining energy performance compared to the baseline manual control. The proposed OCC could maintain indoor thermal comfort whilst saving energy use. Elehwany et al. [14] proposed an OCC based on an offline reinforcement-learning model. The strategy could effectively learn the preferences of occupant thermal preferences and further update the setpoint of indoor air temperature in response to the learned preferences. The simulation results revealed that such a control could offer significant energy savings whilst maintaining indoor thermal comfort. Similar works can be found in Aftab et al. [15] and Lu et al. [16], where the occupants' thermal satisfaction levels were maintained and building energy use was reduced using the proposed OCC strategy. According to the reviewed studies, it is realized that occupant-related information gathered by employing the CV-based detection methods, plays a principal role in various OCC strategies. Further, the OCC based on such information are found to achieve indoor thermal comfort and building energy conservation. ● Application of CV-based OCCs to mechanical ventilation systems In addition to the thermostats discussed above, OCCs based on CV detection methods have also been designed and implemented on mechanical ventilation systems for energy savings or better indoor conditions. Wang et al. [17] systematically reviewed the utilization of CV-based techniques in occupant-centric control for indoor air quality (IAQ) management. In the study, the occupant behaviour was classified and ranked in order of resolution: presence, count location, tracking, identify and behavior (from the bottom to the top). Based on a review of the recent studies, the authors concluded that utilizing CV-based detection techniques can offer high-precision occupant-related information and improve the performance of ventilation controls, in turn achieving the better indoor environment. Table 1 shows a review of studies which applied CV-based OCCs to mechanical ventilation systems. Wang et al. [18] counted the number of occupants in public transportation buildings by means of using vision-based techniques. Then, a hybrid ventilation mode composed of regular demand-control ventilation and anti-infection ventilation mode was proposed. The developed hybrid ventilation mode can flexibly respond to the number of occupants. According to simulation results, the proposed hybrid ventilation mode lowered infection probability by 10.5 %, saving 11.7 % of system energy, compared to the traditional fixed ventilation mode. In the work by Choi et al. [19], the ventilation rates varied according to the number of occupants detected in six offices. The experimental results indicated that the proposed strategy could maintain indoor CO2 concentrations at a satisfying level whilst reducing 35 % and 24 % ventilation rates compared to scheduled ventilation control and CO2-based on/off control, respectively. Further, the proposed control reduced energy use by the recovery ventilator by 40 % and 25 % and heat pump electrical energy by 27 % and 3 %, compared to scheduled control and CO2-based on/off control, respectively. Wang et al. [20] proposed an OCC combined with computer-vision techniques. The results indicated that the strategy could lower 63.07 % of ventilation energy use, whilst effectively keeping the infection risk index at a satisfying level, compared to the traditional ventilation strategy. In general, CV-based OCCs were used to lower the infection risk rate, maintain good IAQ and reduce energy used by mechanical ventilation systems. It was also realized that in addition to occupancy, high-resolution information on occupant behaviour such as position [18], activity [21,22], location [23], skeleton data [18], mask and trajectory [24] was gathered and actively used in OCCs actively in the reviewed studies. ● Application of OCCs to naturally-ventilated and mix-mode ventilation buildings As shown above, CV-based OCCs have been applied to thermostats and mechanical ventilation systems, while the application of CV-based OCCs, even other kinds of OCCs using different detection methods in the context of naturally-ventilated and mix-mode ventilation buildings, has received relatively much less attention. Only very limited number of studies has controlled the status (open or close) of windows based on occupant-related information. The following reviews studies on OCCs in naturally-ventilated and mix-mode ventilation buildings. In naturally-ventilated buildings, the status of windows was adjusted according to occupant-related information. Wang et al. [30], Daly [31] and Jreijiry et al. [32] investigated how occupants' conditions can be used to control envelope openings of the investigated buildings. Fabi et al. [33] conducted a review of factors which found to drive occupants\u2019 window opening behaviour. Roetzel et al. [34] reviewed studies on occupant control on naturally-ventilated buildings and summarized different window switching models. Based on the reviewed studies, the authors emphasized the significance of considering occupant behaviour when developing occupant ventilation control strategies. López Plazas and Sáenz de Tejada [35] gave a similar conclusion that understanding the number of occupants was the key to developing natural ventilation strategies. Haldi and Robinson [36] proposed a window opening algorithm, which determined status of the windows depending on indoor and outdoor air temperature, rain occurrence, last window status and occupancy status (arrival, intermediate and departure). Yu et al. [37] proposed an integrated system which combined natural ventilation system and thermally activated building system. The proposed system can flexibly manage natural ventilation effects according to occupancy, room air temperatures and climate conditions (winter, transitional and summer season). Kim et al. [38] established a multivariable logistic regression model, which used indoor environment quality factors and occupant behaviour as inputs to determine when the investigated windows shall be closed or opened. It was found that such a model could provide an increase in indoor environment quality. In mix-mode buildings, OCCs were used to not only control the status of windows, but also aid the operation of HVAC systems. For instance, Op't Veld [39] proposed a hybrid ventilation strategy which controlled inlet grills and exhaust fans according to the sensed occupancy. Tanner and Henze [40] predicted occupant behaviour and produce the sequence of automatic window opening decisions in mix-mode buildings based on the predicted occupant behaviour. Liu et al. [41] and Liu et al. [41] modelled occupant behaviour and determined the control sequences of HVAC and windows in mix-mode buildings for achieving energy savings. Peng et al. [42] reviewed recent controls of natural ventilation in mix-mode buildings and listed several research projects regarding to hybrid ventilation and mix-mode buildings. Liu and Gou [43] employed a reinforcement learning model in conjunction with the XGBoost algorithm to the investigated room. The model predicted future occupant behaviour and dynamically varied the status of windows and air conditioning system of the investigated room. The simulation results indicated that, compared to the baseline controls, such model could enable an increase in thermal comfort duration by 25 % and decrease in the system energy use by 24.7 %. Besides, three studies [31,32,44] have employed occupant-related information for developing control algorithms in mix-mode buildings. Based on the review above, three main findings were identified. Firstly, CV-based OCCs haven been primarily applied to thermostats and mechanical ventilation systems, while naturally-ventilated and mix-mode buildings have received much less attention. According to the review, the research on CV-based OCCs for naturally-ventilated buildings is limited in comparison to thermostats and mechanical ventilation systems. Second, in the context of naturally-ventilated and mix-mode buildings, basic occupancy information (presence and absence) was commonly used for control purposes. However, the use of high-resolution occupant-related information, such as occupants\u2019 position, activity, location, skeleton data, mask and trajectory, was rare. Third, opening windows is a conventional way to bring in fresh air, but could inevitably cause a leak of interior heat in cold climate conditions. Therefore, controlling windows in cold climate conditions according to occupant-related information has not been fully examined. 1.2 Research gap, question and novelty According to the above literature review, it was realized that recent studies have utilized CV-based detection methods for collecting occupant-related information and implemented the developed OCCs for thermostats ([12,13,45]; Y. [21]) and mechanical ventilation systems (See the studies in Table 1). Indeed, a combination of thermostats and mechanical ventilation system has been conventionally used for indoor environment management and energy conservation. However, only very limited number of studies has focused on the application of OCCs in the context of naturally-ventilated or mix-mode buildings. Further, only occupancy (presence and absence), a kind of low-resolution occupant-related information, was used to govern the status of windows in these studies. The feasibility of controlling windows in cold climate conditions according to occupant-related information has not been fully examined. As the CV-based detection methods advance, higher-resolution occupant-related information (e.g. occupant number, activity) can be applied to natural ventilation system. Therefore, a realized research gap was a lack of OCC applied to natural ventilation systems based on high-resolution occupant-related information for indoor environment management and energy conservation. Many buildings are equipped with openable windows, making a free natural ventilation effect available. Typically, natural ventilation effects could allow for exchanges of air between the indoor and outdoor, therefore opening windows is an effective way to guarantee indoor air quality (IAQ). However, this could inevitably cause heat losses and, in turn, an increase in building energy consumption in winter or cold climates. Therefore, a raised research question is to what extent occupants or building managers should open windows in winter in cold climates concerning keeping good IAQ and minimizing heating energy, and this question remains unclear. In order to bridge the found research gap and answer the research question, this work will propose an OCC that can control opening ratios of windows for building heating load and IAQ management in winters. It is envisioned that such an OCC could flexibly adjust the opening ratios of windows according to occupant-related information, obtained by using CV-based detection approaches, to reduce building energy use while maintaining satisfying levels of thermal comfort and IAQ. This study aims to develop an OCC for governing the thermostat and natural ventilation system in the case study room for building load, thermal comfort and IAQ management. To achieve this aim, four objectives were proposed. First, real-time occupant behaviour and window opening profiles were gathered by deploying vision-based detectors to the studied room. Second, a parametric simulation study of the studied room was performed, and simulation data were generated. Third, the generated data would be used to build predictive models for forecasting the building heating loads, indoor CO2 concentrations and thermal comfort levels in the room. Such models were data-driven and based on predictive shallow artificial neural networks (SANNs), which have a faster response than traditional white-box models [20]. Fourth, an OCC was proposed based on the predictive models and evaluated. The strategy consisted of three sub-controllers: occupancy-based on-off controller, controller of setpoint of indoor air temperature and window openness controller. 2 Methodology 2.1 Case study building The studied Marmont building is an educational building located on the University Park campus of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Nottingham experiences cold and wet winters. During the investigation period (January 19th to 22nd), the average outdoor air temperature during the investigated period was 6.13°, with the maximum and minimum temperatures of 10° and 2.2°. Fig. 1 (a)\u2013(c) shows the studied Marmont building. Fig. 1(d) demonstrates the interior environment of the investigated tutorial room. It had an internal dimension of 13 m in length, 7.5 m in width and 2.5 m in height. The thermal transmittances (U-values) of the interior wall, ceiling, floor and windows were 0.26 W/m2K, 1.1 W/m2K, 1.1 W/m2K and 1.6 W/m2K, respectively. The infiltration rate was estimated to be 1 air change per hour. These values were estimated and obtained from the available CAD drawings. CIBSE Guide A [46] suggested that such type of room should maintain IATs between 19° and 21° in winter for occupants' productivity and well-being. The investigated room is equipped with four large radiators to provide heat when necessary. CIBSE Guide A [46] also recommended controlling indoor CO2 levels below 1000 ppm to guarantee occupants\u2019 health and productivity. The investigated room did not have a mechanical ventilation system, relying instead on natural ventilation through four window openings located above the radiators. In winter, people used to turn on heating radiators and open windows for fresh air. In this context, IAQ can be adjusted by opening windows, yet interior heat is released into the outdoor environment. Therefore, proposing an OCC to optimally control windows and thermostats could lower building energy use whilst maintaining occupants\u2019 thermal satisfaction and IAQ. 2.2 Development and evaluation of vision-based detection camera for occupancy and window detection This work was designed as a pilot study to test the feasibility and evaluate the initial performance of the OCC strategy. Because providing occupant-related information is a prerequisite for developing OCC strategy, we deployed our CV-based detection cameras for a duration of four days for capturing high-resolution occupant-related information of the studied building. A longer-term study should be considered in the future for comprehensively reflecting diversity and variability of occupant behaviour. The following section details the development and deployment of our CV-based detection cameras. 2.2.1 CV-based occupancy detection CV-based detection cameras were adopted in this study because of several reasons. First, this method allows for more comprehensive data collection than traditional sensors. While window contacts and motion detectors provide binary or limited data (open/closed, motion/no motion), this method can capture more complex occupant behaviors and interactions with multiple elements of the built environment simultaneously, such as posture, presence, and activity level, which are crucial for our study's aims. Furthermore, it can detect other activities as well such as occupants using equipment and appliance [47], cooking activities [25], as well as fire and smoke detection [48]. In addition, the use of a single, integrated computer vision system reduces the need for multiple types of sensors, simplifying installation and maintenance while providing richer data sets. This approach can be particularly advantageous in environments where multifactorial analysis is necessary for effective occupant-centric control. To mitigate the high computational load associated with real-time image processing, we are exploring the use of edge computing solutions, which process data locally on the camera or nearby processing unit, reducing latency and bandwidth use. We are also developing methods to automate the calibration process using machine learning algorithms that adapt to changes in camera position or the environment, minimizing the need for manual recalibration. Additionally, we would like to clarify the nature of the data output from our CV system, as it pertains to the concerns about privacy and the practical implementation of this technology. While this work includes example images to illustrate the capabilities of the system in detecting and analyzing occupant behavior and window positions, it is important to emphasize that in practical applications, the CV system does not output raw images. In practice, the system is configured to process and analyze the captured images in real-time to extract useful data points (at the point of capture), such as the number of occupants and the status of window openings. After processing, the system outputs only these quantified data points\u2014not the images themselves. For instance, the system would output data like \u201cthree occupants present\u201d or \u201cwindows half-open,\u201d rather than any visual representation of occupants or the environment. This approach ensures that no images are stored or transmitted over the network, effectively mitigating significant privacy risks. Our focus is on generating actionable, real-time profiles that can be used directly for building management without compromising occupant privacy. 2.2.2 Development of CV-based detection cameras The detection framework introduced by Tien et al. [49,50] showed the potential of using deep learning techniques based on a classification-based algorithm to develop computer vision-based detectors for occupancy level, equipment usage and window opening. To develop a detection model, images of occupants or people and windows were collected to form a training and testing dataset. A total of 1200 images were collected for occupants (400 images for each of the common activities, sitting, standing and walking) and 826 images for windows. For both, 80 % of the dataset was used for training. The software LabelImg was used to label all of the images located within both datasets manually. The labels were assigned entirely around each of the specific regions of interest. For most images, more than one occupant or window appears within the image; hence multiple labels were assigned. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model configuration was used to train the models. To assist in the development of the neural network, the TensorFlow Object Detection API was used. This framework platform provides pre-trained models through a transfer learning approach that enables the development of an effective vision-based detector. The Faster R-CNN (With Inception V2) model was selected. The time required for the training of the models would vary due to the differences in the input data and the desired detection output responses, and each of these trained detectors can be deployed to an AI-powered camera to provide real-time detections. Full details of the detector development and theory are available in our previous works in Tien et al. [49,50]. The trained model was tested in the selected lecture space in the Marmont building. The space has a floor area of 36.62 m square and a floor to ceiling height of 3.52 m. The building is naturally ventilated and integrated with a simple heating system, and six sliding sash windows can be opened at the bottom for ventilation. To enable the capture, a camera with a resolution of 1080p and a wide 90-degree file of view was fixed in the corner of the room and closed to the ceiling. The detection and recognition responses were obtained and recorded every second, generating the occupancy and window opening profiles. Fig. 2 (a) presents the real-time detection and recognition of the occupants and the windows during an experimental test. For most of the detection period, the occupant's activities were correctly detected, and the opened windows were recognized by focusing on the openings or gaps in the windows. In some cases, two bounding boxes were assigned to a detected open window. As observed, bounding boxes could be assigned to the vertical or the horizontal opening gaps, which increases the possibility of the opened windows being detected and recognized. The generated DLIP (deep learning influenced profile) presenting the detected and recognized opening patterns for the selected windows in the Marmont Room during the experimental test is given in Fig. 2(b). For this profile, a scale of 0\u20131 was assigned, suggesting the achievement of a value of 0 when no windows were opened, and a maximum value of 1 was given when all four windows were detected as opened. In addition, the Actual Observation Profile defined the \u2018actual\u2019 window condition and was used to evaluate the performance of the detector. The comparison of the two profiles suggests that the generated DLIP still alternates between the values of the window profile schedule, indicating prediction error. Therefore, further improvements are required to enhance the detection model's accuracy, reliability, and stability. Furthermore, Video 1 presents an example of the detection using the trained model with the real-time generation of the DLIP for windows. The detection method will obtain occupants\u2019 information, including the number of occupants and their activity and detect the status of windows (open/close), generating real-time profiles of heat gains from occupants and window openness ratio. The scenario-based generated profiles are shown in Fig. 3 . Supplementary video related to this article can be found at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2024.111882 The following is/are the supplementary data related to this article. Video S1 Sample video showing the detection and recognition of occupants and windows. See the attached video file. 2.3 Development of predictive models As shown above, this study would develop an OCC that consisted of three controllers: Controller 1: an on-off controller for flexibly providing heating; Controller 2: a controller of the setpoint of IATs for balancing the trade-off between occupants' thermal satisfaction and building heating energy use, and Controller 3: a controller of window opening for guaranteeing good IAQ. These controllers will be detailed in section 2.4. In order to develop Controller 2, a predictive model that can forecast the level of occupants\u2019 thermal satisfaction and heating energy would be needed. As for Controller 3, a predictive model reflecting the response of indoor CO2 levels to heat gains from occupants and window opening ratios would also be needed. 2.3.1 Selection of model predictors (inputs) In order to determine predictors influencing the performance of the investigated building, we conducted a thermal-dynamic analysis of the investigated room. Firstly, we simulated the investigated building by using a building simulation tool. Secondly, we have sought those key factors that could theoretically influence building's thermal and energy performance. Thirdly, we analyzed the simulation data and carefully examined the relationship between model outputs (building heating loads, predictive mean vote (PMV) and indoor CO2 concentrations) and the found factors. Only those factors with a strong relationship coefficient and low P-value (<0.05) were reserved and selected as predictors. This analysis could ensure the predictive model yield good prediction accuracy. The inputs and output of the each model are described in Table 2 . The inputs to the first model included two types: outdoor weather conditions (Daily time step, Weekly time step, Outdoor air temperature, Wind speed, Direct solar radiation, Diffuse solar radiation, Global solar radiation) and building operation information (Heat gains by occupants, Setpoint of IATs, Window openness ratios). The inputs to the second model included Daily time step, Weekly time step and setpoint of IATs. The inputs to the third model included Daily time step, Weekly time step, Heat gains by occupants and Window openness ratios. 2.3.2 Selection of model architecture: shallow artificial neural networks (SANNs) As mentioned before, this study aims to test the feasibility of the proposed OCC strategies. Designing such strategies would require predictive models that could forecast the investigated building's environmental performance (heating load, occupants' thermal satisfaction and indoor CO2 levels). Therefore, this study will develop predictive models for forecasting these three targets: building heating load, occupants' thermal satisfaction and indoor CO2 levels. The following details the process of developing such predictive models. Recently, numerous predictive models have been established and white-box models and black-models have attracted much attention. White-box models are generally based on physical and thermodynamic laws, thereby having rather sound performance. However, building such models can be time-consuming as some key information are unknown and unavailable. Therefore, this paper selected black-box models for prediction. Unlike white-box models, black-box models are data-driven and fully based on data, resulting in a fast response and accurate prediction. This study selected Shallow Artificial Neural Networks (SANNs) as the prediction model. This was because firstly, among all black-box models, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have received wide applications. Lots of studies have succeeded in modelling building energy use and HVAC systems by utilizing ANNs with good accuracy. For instance, Kumar et al. [51], Mohandes et al. [52] and Zhang et al. [53] systematically reviewed the advantages of ANNs and application of ANNs for building energy analysis and predictions. The authors concluded that ANNs could typically yield good accurate and reliable results. Secondly, among all the ANNs, SANNs were found to be a simple but effective tool. It usually has rather simple structure with less hidden layers (conventionally less than three) than those deep ANNs. Therefore, they are good at dealing with lightweight fitting and prediction work with fast training speed, low computation cost and resources required. Thirdly, in our previous works [20,21], SANNs were used to predict the heating loads, PMV levels and CO2 concentrations of similar types of buildings. Therefore, this study would also employ SANNs for prediction. Fig. 4 depicts the architecture of SANNs used in this study. They have four sub-layers in the hidden layer. The letter n represents the number of inputs to the model, and h is the number of hidden units in the hidden layer in the model. The number of n can be found in Table 2. There were 10 hidden units ( h = 10) in the hidden layer in all models. 2.3.3 Parametric simulation study and data preparation As shown in the last subsection, this work selected SANNs as predictive models. Such models are typically established by applying a set of training algorithms to a group of data, which represent the environment and energy performance of the investigated building. Therefore, this study conducted a parametric simulation study and extracted simulation data from the study. Afterwards, the simulation data would be used to build predictive models for forecasting the investigated room's building heating load, indoor PMV levels, and CO2 concentrations. This subsection introduces the conducted parametric study, and the training of models will be shown in subsection 2.3.4. The simulation engine used in this paper was a building energy simulation tool called IES Virtual Environment (VE). The IES VE could simulate the interactions between buildings and their outdoor environment, and it was adopted and validated in our previous works in Shahzad et al. [54] and Shahzad et al. [55]. Table 3 demonstrates the created scenarios in the parametric study. As can be seen, 25 scenarios were created, and the data from such scenarios were used to develop Model-1 for forecasting building heating energy loads and Model-2 for forecasting indoor PMV levels. As for Model 3, 101 scenarios with window opening ratios ranging from 0 to 1 were created. The IES VE is equipped with a powerful Python API package, which enables users to conveniently set up simulation parameters, efficiently automating repetitive works and easily run a large-scale parametric study. After running the parametric study, data were exported to Excel sheets and then examined, cleaned and merged in the Anaconda Spyder Platform. The next step would be training models based on the data. 2.3.4 Building predictive models The last subsection shows how simulation data were produced. This subsection introduces how predictive models were built in the study. The simulation data were randomly divided into three datasets: training (70 %), validation (15 %) and test (15 %) datasets. The training data were fed into models for models\u2019 learning of the relationship between the inputs and outputs. The models were then validated and tested on validation and test datasets. The development of such models was completed in MATLAB Neural Network Fitting Tool GUI (Graphical User Interface). The tanh function was selected as the activation function, and Levenberg-Marquardt algorithms were used to train models. Selecting these activation functions and training algorithms enabled quick convergence and good fitting performance. 2.4 Development of controllers This paper proposed an OCC consisting of three sub-controllers: occupancy-based on-off controller, controller of setpoint of indoor air temperature and window openness controller. The integration of these controllers with a vision-based detection approach is shown in Fig. 5 . The following details the proposed sub-controllers. 2.4.1 Controller 1: occupancy-based on-off controller Controller 1 was applied when vision-based detection cameras found that the investigated space was occupied. Under such a situation, heating would be provided to improve the level of occupants\u2019 thermal satisfaction. 2.4.2 Controller 2: controller of setpoint of indoor air temperatures Controller 2 was used when occupants were in the room. Under such a situation, the setpoint of IATs shall be optimized to reduce building heating load without sacrificing occupants\u2019 thermal comfort. The setpoint was optimized by using a performance indicator, distance d shown in Equation (1). The distance d measures the distance between a setpoint temperature and the original point (0,0). Thus, the distance d can further quantify the energy and comfort performance of any temperature setpoint. The setpoint temperature with the lowest d is regarded as the optimal setpoint temperature. (1) d S = E N , S 2 + C N , S 2 where. dS is the performance indicator. EN,S is the normalized heating energy load by using predictive Model-1. CN,S is the normalized PMV by using predictive Model-2. The terms EN,S and CN,S are calculated by using Equations (2)-(3). In the equations, the subscripts max and min represent the maximum and minimum values in the historical datasets, respectively. By adopting Equations (2) and (3), predicted building energy loads and PMVs were weighted so they can have even contributions to the evaluation of energy-comfort performance of a setpoint of IATs. (2) E N , S = E S − E min E max − E min (3) C N , S = C S − C min C max − C min When looking for the optimal setpoint temperature, a hundred setpoints uniformly distributed in the acceptable ranges were generated. Afterwards, the temperature setpoint with the lowest d was selected as the optimal setpoint temperature. 2.4.3 Controller 3: window openness controller Controller 3 was used to control the window openness ratios. This study performs a feasibility study and assumes that the investigated room is equipped with hypothetical actuators that can modify the openness of windows according to the signals received from Controller 3. When occupants were not in the room while the windows remained open, for example, when the occupants left the windows open after leaving the space, Controller 3 would turn off windows to avoid leaking interior heat energy and thus achieve energy conservation. When occupants were in the investigated room, Controller 3 would adjust window opening ratios in response to real-time heat gains from occupants. This was achieved by using the built predictive Model-3. At each time step, Controller 3 predicted the indoor CO2 concentrations at different levels of window opening ratios. Afterwards, it selected the optimal opening ratio that can make indoor CO2 concentrations reach 1000 ppm, the safe level suggested by UK building regulation CIBSE Guide A [46]. This method can provide good indoor air quality without causing excessive heat leakage caused by opening windows. 2.4.4 Evaluation of controllers In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed OCC, 8 simulation cases have been created and presented in Table 4 . In Cases 01 and 02, it was assumed that occupants were in the room from 06:30\u201318:30 during weekdays, and the room was vacant during weekends. The heating is therefore provided when occupants were present with the setpoint of IATs set as 21° and 19°, respectively. It also assumed that the window opening ratios were 0.25 when occupants were present (see Table 4). This study selected Cases 03 and 04 as two baseline cases. In the two cases, a real-time profile of heat gains by occupants (shown in Fig. 3(a)) and a profile of window openness ratios (shown in Fig. 3(b)) were adopted. The purpose of setting the two cases was to show how occupancy (presence and open windows) would influence the environment and energy performance of the room. In Cases 05 and 06, Controller 1 was used to flexibly provide heating. In Case 07, Controllers 1 and 2 were used together. In Case 08, all the three Controllers were applied. 3 Results 3.1 Evaluation of predictive models The three developed predictive models were data-driven, and they were constructed on the basis of simulation data. The prediction accuracy of models was examined by using the coefficient of determination, i.e. R2. In this paper, because the predictive models would be linked with the controllers, it was necessary to ensure that predictive models were sound and accurate. Therefore, only the model with an R2 higher than 0.8 was regarded as sound and accurate and can be further coupled with the controllers. The prediction accuracy of the three predictive models is illustrated in Fig. 6 . As can be seen, the Model-1 yielded excellent prediction accuracy, with R2 higher than 0.99 over training, validation and test datasets. Both Model-2 and Model-3 achieved a prediction accuracy of over 0.8 over all datasets, while some outliers were noticed. Therefore, such models were technically sound and would be used in the proposed controllers. 3.2 Generated profiles of heating and window opening This section shows the generated profiles of heating and window opening as a result of applying the proposed controllers shown in Table 4. The set 8 simulation cases contained different combination of heat gains profiles, heating profiles, setpoint of heating and profiles of window opening ratios. As different controllers were applied in these cases, the generated profiles of hearting and window opening differed. This way, the performance of the proposed OCC can be obtained by comparing the cases. 3.2.1 Heating profiles The profiles of fixed pre-defined and real-time heat gains by occupants are illustrated in Fig. 7 (a). As can be seen, Cases 01\u201302 assume that occupants were in the investigated room from 06:30\u201318:30 during weekdays, and there were no occupants during the weekends. However, in the vision-based detection scenario, the approach found that occupants were in the room for a few hours during the weekends. Further, the occupants entered the room after around 08:00 on weekdays, which is later than the fixed pre-defined schedule. This study will show the impact of real-time occupant behaviour as compared to the pre-defined schedule. The profiles of the heating schedule are shown in Fig. 7(b). In Cases 01\u201304, heating was provided from 06:30\u201318:30. In Cases 05\u201308, by employing vision-based detection approaches and an occupancy-based on-off controller, heating was flexibly provided once occupants were found to be in the room. The profiles of the setpoint of IATs in Cases 01\u201306 are shown in Fig. 7(c) and (d). In these cases, the setpoint of IATs remained constant as they did not vary with time or occupant behaviour. In Fig. 7(d), the setpoint of IATs in Cases 07\u201308 was dynamic, i.e. changed over time, as a consequence of applying the proposed Controller 2. This would help to reduce building energy load whilst maintaining occupants\u2019 thermal satisfaction levels. 3.2.2 Window opening profiles Fig. 8 demonstrates the profiles of window openings in Cases 01\u201308. In Cases 01\u201302, a fixed pre-defined schedule was applied that windows were open with the openness ratio being 0.25 from 06:30\u201318:30 during weekdays while closed at weekends. In Cases 03\u201307, a real-time profile of window opening was used. In Case 08, an optimized profile window opening, obtained by employing the proposed controller 3, was used. 3.3 Assessment of building performance The last section showed the generated profiles of heating and window opening after using the proposed controllers. The following describes and analyzes the energy performance, indoor thermal comfort levels and IAQ performance of the investigated room in the cases set. 3.3.1 Energy performance The energy performance of the studied room in the proposed cases is shown in Fig. 9 . The total energy load in Cases 01 and 02 were approximately 152.3 kWh and 107.7 kWh, respectively. In Cases 03 and 04, where profiles of real-time heat gains by occupants and window opening were used, the total heating loads were about 81.3 kWh and 51.9 kWh, respectively. By comparing Cases 03 and 04 to Cases 01 and 02, it was found that occupants' activity (behaviour and opening windows) could significantly influence building heating loads. In Cases 05 and 06, Controller 1 was used to flexibly provide heating when occupants were in the room and shut down the heating system when the room was vacant. This could enable a reduction in heating energy loads by between 13.8% and 22.7 % in comparison to Cases 03 and 04. In Case 07, where Controllers 1 and 2 were applied, heating was flexibly provided, and the setpoint of IATs changed in response to building energy loads and occupants\u2019 thermal satisfaction. The total heating energy loads in Case 07 was 51.9 kWh, which was between Case 05 (70.1 kWh) and Case 06 (40.1 kWh). The total heating energy loads in Case 08, where all the controllers were applied, was about 29.4 kWh, lower than the others. By comparing Case 08 to Case 07, it was realized that Controller 3, which adjusted window opening ratios for better IAQ, further reduced total heating energy loads by 43.4 %. In comparison to Case 03 (baseline 1) and Case 04 (baseline 2), the application of the proposed strategy in Case 08 offered a decrease in total heating energy loads by between 43.4% and 63.8 %. 3.3.2 Indoor thermal comfort This subsection evaluates the thermal comfort performance in the proposed cases. The thermal comfort metric used in this study, PMVs are analyzed and shown in Table 5 . In Case 01, the PMV levels ranged from −1.14 to 0.08 with the average absolute PMV of 0.32. In Case 02, the PMV levels were between −1.17 and −0.31, with the average absolute PMV being 0.57. Cases 03 and 04 shared very similar maximum, averaged absolute and minimum PMV values. Similarly, Cases 05, 06 and 07 had similar levels of maximum and averaged absolute PMV values. Case 07 was found to have the lowest minimum PMV values (−1.87). It was also found that Case 08 had the highest level of indoor thermal comfort than the other cases. Case 08 had the lowest maximum PMV (0.32), lowest average absolute PMV (0.15) and highest minimum PMV (−0.68) compared to the other cases. This means that, in comparison to the other cases, the ranges of PMV values in Case 08 are more densely distributed around the zero level, which was the neutral (neither cold nor hot sensation). In comparison to the two baselines (Case 03 and 04), the proposed controllers enhanced indoor thermal comfort levels, and the average absolute PMV values were enhanced by 0.36\u20130.37. 3.3.3 Air quality performance This subsection shows and analyzes the CO2 concentrations in the proposed cases. The simulated CO2 concentrations in the proposed cases are shown in Fig. 10 . As can be seen from Fig. 10(a), the simulated CO2 concentrations in Cases 01 and 02 were below 1000 ppm because windows remained open from 06:30\u201318:30. However, it must be noted this was achieved at the expense of a substantial waste of energy caused by opening windows, as shown in Fig. 9. The simulated CO2 concentrations in Cases 03\u201307, where a real-time profile of window opening ratios was used, were over 1000 ppm for 15.8 % of the time. In the cases, several peaks were observed, and the highest level of CO2 concentrations was about 3847 ppm. Therefore, occupants can suffer from poor IAQ. Therefore, in this study, it was found that leaving the control access of windows to occupants was unbeneficial in terms of energy savings and good IAQ performance. In Case 08, where Controller 3 was used to govern the window opening ratios, the indoor CO2 concentrations fluctuated around the level of 1000 ppm. The indoor CO2 concentrations were over 1000 ppm for only about 9 % of the time, with a few peaks of less than 1400 ppm. Therefore, in comparison to the baseline cases (Case 03 and 04), the proposed controller significantly improved IAQ, while a large proportion of energy was saved. 4 Discussion and limitations The above section has demonstrated the improvement achieved by implementing the proposed OCC to the thermostats and windows in the investigated building. The simulation results indicated that, compared to the baseline, the control could offer a decrease in building heating loads by between 43.4% and 63.8 % and an improvement of PMV levels by 0.36\u20130.37. The proposed OCC could also maintain indoor CO2 concentrations below 1000 ppm for about 91 % of the studied time, while 84.2 % of the time with several peaks over 3000 ppm in the baseline cases. The following discusses the study's limitations and gives suggestions about how to solve them in future works. First, this paper performs an exploratory study investigating the feasibility of properly opening windows for indoor energy, thermal comfort and IAQ management. As shown above, this paper assumed the windows were equipped with hypothetical actuators that directly received commands from controller 3 and acted accordingly, while the actuators' energy use and behaviour were not considered. In the future, the energy used by the actuators shall be considered. Secondly, there still has been great potential for developing more accurate predictive models. In this study, only Model-1 achieved R2 over 0.95 over all datasets, while Model-2 and Model-3 performed less accurate. Especially many outliers were noticed in Fig. 6(g)\u2013(i). It was also found that Model-3 underestimated indoor CO2 concentrations on some occasions, which caused controller 3 not to be able to maintain indoor CO2 concentrations below 1000 ppm (Fig. 10 (c)). Therefore, attention shall be paid to enhancing the accuracy of Model-3. Thirdly, this study evaluates the proposed strategy's performance by using the building energy load as the metric. In order to further assess the savings in energy use and carbon emissions, exact heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems and controllers shall be assigned to the investigated room. However, the current version of IES VE does not support advanced user-defined-control functions for the HVAC system. Therefore, a co-simulation framework shall be considered in the future. A possible option is to use Python/Matlab and EnergyPlus for co-simulation. In recent years, reinforcement learning control is a popular algorithm. Yu et al. [56] systematically reviewed the application of reinforcement learning in the energy-related occupant behaviour simulation and control strategies. Liu and Gou [43] created a Deep-Q network model for controlling window and HVAC in right sequences for indoor thermal comfort and energy efficiency. This model could enable an improvement of indoor thermal comfort by 24 % and reduction of air conditioning usage by 24.7 %. Jung et al. [57] established a data-efficient reinforcement learning model to control indoor air temperatures according to occupants' activity levels (seated, walking, handling 50 kg load). The experimental results showed that such model can lower about 10.9 % of thermal discomfort issue. Besides, occupant-centric reinforcement learning has been also developed and applied to thermostats [14], hot water system (Heidari et al., 2022) and HVAC systems [58]. This work did not take the operation dynamics of the investigated thermostats system into consideration. Therefore, it is suggested to model the thermostat system in tools such as TRNSYS and build occupant-centric reinforcement learning algorithms for assessing the performance of the proposed OCC strategy. Fourth, the effectiveness and efficiency of computer vision against traditional sensors in various real-world settings should be examined. This will help validate our approach and refine the system for better scalability and practicality. Depending on the outcomes of our scalability studies, we consider integrating hybrid systems that combine computer vision with traditional sensors to balance complexity and practicality. Finally, it is also strongly suggested that the strategy be empirically applied to real HVAC systems and different climates after verifying its performance on the simulation platform. 5 Conclusions and future works With the recent developments in computer vision, real-time occupant-related information can be efficiently gathered. The application of such information to thermostats and natural ventilation systems has received much less attention. This paper proposes an OCC and applies it to thermostats and natural ventilation systems for achieving three objectives: better indoor air quality, improved indoor thermal comfort and reduced building heating energy. First, high-resolution information on occupants were obtained by using CV-based detection cameras. Second, an OCC strategy based on predictive models were developed. Third, the benefits of applying the proposed strategy were examined. The simulation results showed that the control could offer a decrease in building heating loads by between 43.4% and 63.8 % and an improvement of PMV levels by 0.36\u20130.37 compared to the baseline. The proposed OCC could also keep indoor CO2 concentrations below 1000 ppm for about 91 % of the studied time, while only 84.2 % of the time with several peaks over 3000 ppm in the baseline cases. Future work shall focus on deepening the integration between computer-vision and building systems. This can be achieved by modelling the dynamics of the heating system and indoor environment and then conducting co-simulation between TRNSYS and MATLAB. It is also necessary to examine the applicability and efficiency of the OCC across different building types and climate zones to determine its adaptability. Because vision-based detection approaches can cause privacy issues, it is worthwhile to alleviate the issue by proposing more moderate solutions.

        "dc:description": "Recently, Occupant-Centric Controls (OCCs) have attracted great attention. Many studies have applied OCCs to mechanical ventilation systems, while natural ventilation systems have gathered much less attention. The natural ventilation effect, driven by opening windows or vents, can be effective in improving indoor air quality, however, result in a leakage of interior heating energy in winter in cold climates. Therefore, the controls of thermostats and natural ventilation systems shall be designed well so that satisfying levels of thermal comfort, air quality and energy conservation can be simultaneously guaranteed. This study proposes an OCC and applies it to thermostats and natural ventilation systems for indoor thermal comfort, air quality and heating energy management. The strategy comprises three controllers: occupancy-based on-off controller, controller of setpoint of indoor air temperature and window openness controller. First, real-time profiles of heat gains from occupants and window openness were collected by employing vision-based detection. Second, a parametric building simulation study was conducted, and then simulation data were generated to develop predictive shallow artificial neural networks for forecasting the indoor conditions and energy performance of the investigated room. Third, the performance of the proposed strategy was examined. Compared to the baselines, the control could offer a decrease in building heating loads by between 43.4% and 63.8 % and an improvement of predicted mean vote levels by 0.36\u20130.37. The proposed OCC could also maintain indoor CO2 concentrations below 1000 ppm for about 91 % of the studied time, while 84.2 % of the time with several peaks over 3000 ppm in the baseline cases.",
