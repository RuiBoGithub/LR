School of Architecture Tsinghua University Beijing 100084 China The accurate identification of the real-time thermal state of personnel working indoors has been the focus of researchers. In this study, a detailed examination of the entire process of developing a personal comfort model, from theory to practice, is conducted. In particular, the subject of this investigation is a smart air conditioner capable of predicting thermal sensation based on an infrared (IR) sensor that measures the skin temperature of personnel and then implements automatic control. Random forest algorithm was employed to establish a thermal sensation prediction model, which accepts skin and air temperatures as input parameters. The model achieves a high prediction accuracy value of 0.84. Given the measurement errors of low-cost IR sensors, a simulated temperature measurement experiment based on the manikin was conducted, and an error calibration method based on multiple linear regression was developed through the experiment. 30 subjects participated in another prototype test experiment, which proved that the air conditioner can accomplish effective automatic control based on the prediction of thermal sensation, avoid the occurrence of extreme temperatures, and ensure the thermal comfort of personnel. The possible causes of remaining problems and potential improvement schemes are discussed in detail.

Multiple environmental factors comprehensively affect the health, comfort, and work efficiency of personnel [2\u20134]. According to previous studies, thermal comfort has a significant impact on overall environmental satisfaction [5]. Since the last century, the study of thermal comfort modeling has been favored by researchers. The most widely used technique is the predicted mean vote (PMV) model proposed by Fanger [6]. This model was subsequently used to guide the indoor environment design specified in standards (e.g., ASHRAE 55 [7], ISO 7730 [8]). The adaptive model proposed by de Dear and Brager [9] is another major model that has undergone continuous improvement in recent years [10]. As the conduct of in-depth studies progresses, researchers have become more aware of the influence of individual differences [11]. At the research level, these differences are mainly reflected in individual thermal preferences and the local thermal sensitivity of the body [12]. Variations in preferences are also reflected by the environmental control behavior. Individuals may have considerable differences and misconceptions regarding suitable control. According to the study by the Building Energy Research Center of Tsinghua University [13], more than 80 % of residents directly set a fixed temperature value in using air conditioners; the rest of the users choose a temperature value and then adjust it according to their sensation. This practice leads to the excessive energy consumption of air conditioners. The building operating energy consumption accounts for approximately 30 % of the global energy consumption [14]. Setting the indoor temperature to be either excessively low or high has a significant impact on the energy consumption of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems in buildings [15]. In summary, to satisfy the demand for a comfortable indoor environment and save energy, establishing a thermal environment control strategy for coordinating the foregoing is necessary. Previous studies have shown that environmental control implemented through personnel can improve the acceptance of the set environment [16]. However, currently, a mature HVAC automatic control logic seems indispensable because non-professionals generally lack knowledge of the resulting energy consumption when they manually adjust air conditioner settings. In recent years, the deployment of sensors and real-time feedback greatly promote the application of conventional models [17,18]. However, satisfactory solutions for thermal comfort on an individual scale and in non-uniform scenes have not been proposed. ASHRAE RP-884 database [19] and ASHRAE Global Thermal Comfort Database II [20] were used to analyze the prediction accuracy of the PMV model, respectively [21,22]. It is found that the predicted value deviated from the actual thermal sensation vote (TSV). In the adaptive theory, the considerations of building types, climate zones, and other factors in the model seem to be suitable for the formulation of standards [10,23] and are not closely associated with smart devices for micro-environments. Therefore, the combination of a conventional thermal comfort model and emerging technology is not an optimal solution for guiding indoor environment design. Accordingly, several relevant studies have attempted to identify new methods. 1.2 Related work Smart technologies, such as Internet of Things and artificial intelligence (AI), have greatly boosted the development of fields involved in sustainable environments [24]. Indoor thermal environment design is no exception, and this development trend was described as user-centered or occupant-centered [25]. Currently, numerous study results have been reported, and researchers have reviewed publications in this field. From the perspective of sensors and measured objects, Mansi et al. [26] reviewed four physiological signals commonly used in the field of thermal comfort, namely electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardiogram, skin temperature, and galvanic skin response signals, because of the correlation of these signals in evaluating indoor thermal comfort. Čulić et al. [27] summarized the typical environmental and user-related parameters in thermal comfort modeling and processing collected data. They classified the applied data collection technology into camera technology, wearable devices, and connected sensor systems. Xie et al. [28] comprehensively summarized the smart technologies involved in relevant studies. They grouped the skin temperature measuring devices into invasive, semi-invasive, and non-invasive categories based on the invasiveness of the sensors. In thermal prediction modeling, ML technique was proven to be not inferior to the conventional model in predicting accuracy based on an existing database [29]. Kim et al. [30] comprehensively described the framework of the thermal comfort prediction model and presumed that the personal comfort model predicted the thermal comfort response of individuals rather than groups. Ngarambe et al. [31] discussed common ML methods and algorithms that have been widely used for determining the thermal comfort of personnel and identified their advantages and disadvantages. Martins et al. [32] summarized the data characteristics involved in relevant studies and elaborated on the input and output variables, algorithms, and performance indicators of models. In summary, existing studies reflect the characteristics of wide coverage and rapid development in thermal prediction modeling; however, some general deficiencies are found. For example, the main research on personal comfort models has focused on the final prediction accuracy of specific modeling techniques rather than developing a structured and ultimately transferable method to apply the model to real-world scenarios [30]. Among the studies that have evaluated model application, only a few have been conducted in real-world settings [32]. The consensus is that, eventually, thermal comfort models have to be applied to building environment control. However, the studies on the combination of the foregoing are few, and most of research results on thermal comfort have not been applied to building control [33]. Accordingly, the authors are led to the conclusion that the foregoing must be the focus of research in the field of built environments. In this study, a smart air conditioner is developed based on IR temperature measurements. The mean facial and hand temperatures of the human body can be measured using a low-cost IR sensor, and the thermal sensation can be predicted to guide the automatic control of air conditioners. We believe that the IR sensor is an important means to realize the non-perceptible thermal sensation prediction and has a high application potential. According to the literature search, relevant studies on the application of IR sensors have been found. For example, Ghahramani et al. [34,35] designed eyeglasses with IR sensors. By measuring the skin temperature of the human face and combining the hidden Markov model algorithm to monitor an individual\u2019s thermoregulation performance and thermal comfort level, an 82.8 % accuracy in predicting thermal discomfort can be achieved. Aryal et al. [36\u201338] systematically studied facial feature recognition and thermal comfort prediction models based on IR temperature measurements with and without PCSs, proving the feasibility of this method. They found that compared with the data obtained by environmental sensors, the combination of environmental data with physiological data can improve the prediction of thermal sensation by 3 %\u20135%. Cosma et al. [39] used a new fused sensor\u2013visual sensing system to extract the skin and clothing temperatures of subjects. In subsequent studies, ML method was used to predict the mean time leading to thermal discomfort [44]. Similarly, Li et al. [40,41] proposed a new framework for real-time thermal comfort prediction using IR thermal imaging. By integrating the features collected from different facial areas, the framework can predict the thermal comfort preferences of subjects with 85 % accuracy. 1.3 Objectives This study is a relatively complete exploration and practice in the field of thermal comfort identification and control. Compared with previous research, this study not only focuses on the accuracy of thermal comfort modeling but also aims to explore whether this model can achieve the expected performance in actual air conditioning operations. Therefore, we applied the prediction model to the control of household air conditioners, conducted a prototype test experiment, and evaluated its performance in terms of subjective and objective aspects. In addition, this study implemented a separate error-correction experiment of an IR sensor to determine the possible systematic errors of low-cost sensors. 2 Methodology The focus of this study is to explore whether accurate thermal sensation prediction can be achieved using IR temperature measurement data and whether an air conditioner based on a prediction model can achieve satisfactory performance and ensure the thermal comfort of personnel. Specifically, this study carried out a manikin experiment (method: Section 2.1, result: Section 3.1), a modeling analysis based on a data-driven algorithm (method: Section 2.2, result: Section 3.2), and a human subject experiment (method: Section 2.3, result: Section 3.3). Fig. A1 in the Appendix shows the framework of the paper. 2.1 IR sensor error correction experiment Two IR sensors were examined in this study: FLIR C2 IR thermal imaging camera (accuracy: ±2 °C or 2 % greater at 25 °C nominal) and Mitsubishi MIR8032B1-01(IR sensor: 80 × 32), which were used for collecting modeling data and measuring the temperature during the operation of the air conditioner prototype, respectively. Although the temperature measurement accuracy of FLIR C2 is not as high as that of contact thermocouples, it can be automatically calibrated during use. Previous studies have demonstrated that the skin temperature data based on this sensor can achieve satisfactory thermal sensation prediction[42]. As for MIR8032B1-01, no description of its temperature accuracy is provided in the official manual. Therefore, the measurement accuracy was tested before the actual application of the sensor. A considerable deviation between the obtained data and real values was found. To minimize the influence of measurement errors on thermal sensation prediction, an artificial climate chamber experiment was conducted to analyze the errors of the two IR sensors under different environmental conditions and explore a feasible method for temperature calibration. According to present knowledge, the temperature measurement accuracy of IR sensors is affected by factors, such as measurement distance, ambient temperature and humidity, atmospheric pressure, and surface emissivity of measured objects. Based on previous tests, we found that the measurement distance and air temperature had more evident effects; accordingly, this study focused on the influence of these two variables on the measurement error. The experiments were conducted in an artificial climate chamber. To simulate the process of an IR sensor measuring human skin temperature to the extent possible, a manikin was used as a test subject. The experimental setup and manikin are shown in Fig. 1 . The manikin used in this experiment is developed by PT TEKNIK (Denmark). The body shape is very similar to that of an ordinary adult, with a height of about 171 cm and a body surface area of about 1.67 m2. According to the physiological structure of the human body, the manikin is divided into 22 regions, and the heating power and skin temperature of different regions can be independently controlled and monitored. The accuracy of skin temperature control is ±0.1 °C. The manikin has four control modes, including 1) no heating mode; 2) constant temperature mode; 3) constant heat flow mode; 4) thermal comfort mode. In the experiment, we ran the constant temperature mode and set the same skin temperature for all 22 regions to control the variables to the extent possible. Considering the normal range of human skin temperature, the manikin\u2019s skin temperatures were set to 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, and 37 °C. The manikin was placed on the side of the chamber. The distance between the IR sensor and manikin was adjusted using a movable desk. The maximum side length of the artificial climate chamber was 5 m, and the measuring distances were set to 1, 2, and 3 m. Before the actual experiment, the position of the desk at different distances was marked on the floor of the chamber to ensure accurate distance control. The air temperatures were set to 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, and 30 °C, and the relative humidity was set to 50 %. To obtain accurate environmental parameters, two WSZY-1 temperature and humidity recorders (±0.5 °C, ±3%) were arranged in the chamber. The average reading was considered as the current environmental parameter. The MIR8032B1-01 IR sensor was fixed to an iron stand in a stable position. Single-frame measurement was performed by connecting the sensor to a computer. Before each measurement, the sensor was initialized to exclude the influence of temperature rise on the measurement results. The portable IR camera, FLIR C2, was held by the experimenter, maintaining the same plane as MIR8032B1-01 to photograph the manikin. In summary, six manikin skin temperature and six air temperature readings were used in this experiment. Because the manikin does not have a cooling function, the skin temperature cannot be less than the air temperature. Excluding these conditions, 33 temperature combinations were used in the experiment. For each condition, 10 temperature measurements were performed at three different distances. Theoretically, 990 temperature matrix data points can be obtained from each IR sensor. Excluding the data points in the images that could not be recognized due to factors, such as sensor shaking, 982 temperature matrix data points were finally retained. Section 3.1 will show the analysis results of the data. 2.2 Datasets and modeling The data used for modeling in this study were obtained from IR images and corresponding subjective votes accumulated in previous climate chamber experiments[43]. The set values of ambient temperature and humidity remained unchanged during each experiment. The measured data were recorded using the WSZY-1 temperature and humidity recorder. The air temperature ranged from 21.8 to 30.9 °C, and the relative humidity range was 24.6 %\u201382.4 %. Throughout the experiment, the indoor air velocity was controlled to be less than 0.1 m/s. The metabolic rate of the subjects during the experiment was approximately 1 met (sitting)\u20131.1 met (typing), and the clothing insulation was approximately 0.78 clo [7]. The experimenter used the FLIR C2 IR camera to capture the photographs of the subjects\u2019 faces and hands to record the skin temperature when subjects completed the questionnaires, as shown in Fig. 2 . While IR images were captured, the subjects reported their thermal sensations through a questionnaire. The accompanying software of FLIR C2, i.e., FLIR Tools, was used to derive the temperature information from the photographs. As shown in Fig. 2, the face (marked with a circle) and back of the hand (marked with a box) have been selected to obtain the mean skin temperatures. A total of 541 data points are collected from 19 subjects; each data point contains information on skin temperature, environmental parameters, and TSV (typical 7-points scale). The information on the subjects (obtained through experiment) and measured air temperature distribution are summarized in Table 1 and shown in Fig. 3 , respectively. A data-driven ML algorithm was used to build a thermal sensation prediction model. The purpose of this study is not to determine the ML algorithm with the best performance. Hence, we chose random forest as the algorithm because of its good performance in our previous work [42] and other studies [29,38,44,45]. The data were divided into 20 % test set, and 80 % training set. Hyperparameters were adjusted by a grid search and evaluated by fourfold cross-validation. K-fold cross-validation is a common strategy that leverages limited datasets to reduce the risk of overfitting and obtain a more generalized model. The final prediction performance was evaluated based on the prediction accuracy of the model in the test set. All data processing and modeling were done on a personal computer using the Python language, and libraries such as scikit-learn [46] and pandas [47] were adopted to do this. The TSV in the source data is a continuous vote, which was transformed into three categories: \u201ccold\u201d (TSV ≤ − 1), \u201cneutral\u201d (−1 < TSV < 1), and \u201chot\u201d (TSV ≥ 1). This method of transformation, which uses slightly cool and slightly warm as boundaries, has also been used in similar studies [37,48]. After this, the thermal sensation prediction model was transformed into a random forest classifier. The input parameters were selected from existing data features: air, hand, and mean facial temperatures; these features and their combinations were modeled. The main reason we chose air, hand, and mean facial temperatures is whether these parameters can be measured by the sensors used. Because this study used an IR sensor to measure the skin temperature of the human body, so we chose the mean skin temperature of the hands and faces exposed to the outside world in a general indoor environment. As for whether these features can be used for thermal sensation, the facial [38,41] and hand [48,49] skin temperature has been used in many studies related to IR sensors, and proved feasible. According to Čulić et al.\u2019s [27] review of the application of smart sensors in personal comfort models, facial and hand skin temperature are also the most commonly applied features. For air temperature, a related study [21] has also shown that even if the only air temperature is used as the model input, good prediction results can be obtained. Therefore, we selected the air, hand, and mean facial temperature as the three main features based on the realization ability at the technical level and the experience of previous studies. 2.3 Air conditioner prototype performance test The thermal sensation prediction model must be verified in theoretical and practical applications. Accordingly, in this experiment, the thermal sensation prediction model based on an IR sensor (details are found in Section 3.1) is integrated into the control panel of a household air conditioner (details are shown in Appendix Table A.1). The prototype could measure the target temperature using the MIR8032B1-01 IR sensor. The measured temperature was inputted via the control panel for thermal sensation prediction. The predicted value was used as a basis to guide the set temperature adjustment. The experiment was conducted in a single-person office (Fig. 4 ). Except for the air conditioner prototype, original fan coils were present. Before each test, the experimenter turned on the fan coil unit and set the temperature to 22, 24, 26, 28, and 30 °C to create different initial environment conditions. When the actual test began, the experimenter turned off the fan coil and set the temperature values to 22, 26, and 30 °C as the initial working state of the prototype. For this experiment, the number of initial conditions was 15, and 30 subjects were recruited (10 men and 20 women). Each subject participated in the experiment once, and two subjects participated under each condition. Information on the subjects is summarized in Table 2 , and individual information on each subject is given in Appendix Table A.2. To simulate situations realistically, strict requirements on the type of clothing were not implemented in the experiment. Because the experiment was conducted in July, the subjects were all wearing summer clothes with a 0.36\u20130.61-clo clothing insulation range. As shown in Fig. 4, the IR sensor is below the prototype, and the distance between the IR sensor and the subject was 3 m. The selection of this distance considers actual scenes; it is also a factor in the proportion of the measured part in the IR image and the calibration range of the sensor error. The air supply plate was oriented in the upward direction to avoid draft sensation. The measured air velocity at approximately 30 cm above the head of a test subject was less than 0.1 m/s. Because the IR sensor in this study cannot automatically recognize human body parts, two temperature measurement windows with adjustable sizes and positions in the IR image are set. The red and green windows were used to measure the mean hand and facial temperature, respectively. In each experiment, when the subjects are seated and stable, the experimenter adjusts the measurement windows through a computer to ensure that the participants are within the target area. The subjects remain seated (metabolic rate: 1 met), and their head and hand positions do not move (a subject\u2019s right hand remained on the table attached to the seat) throughout the experiment. Each test lasted for 90 min. The prototype read the temperature data every 5 min and predicted the thermal sensation to adjust the temperature setting. Automatic regulation logic can be classified into basic and special case strategies. In the basic strategy, if the thermal sensation is predicted to be hot, the existing set temperature is reduced by 1 °C to obtain the new temperature setting. If the thermal sensation is predicted to be cold, the existing set temperature is increased by 1 °C to obtain the new temperature setting. If the thermal sensation is predicted to be neutral, the existing set temperature is not adjusted. For special cases, when the predicted thermal sensation is hot (cold) after the base adjustment based on cold (hot) prediction, the current setting must first be maintained. If the next thermal sensation prediction is also hot (cold) or neutral, control must be implemented according to the base adjustment. If the predicted thermal sensation is cold (hot), then the set value remains unchanged. Before each experiment started, the subjects would wait in the corridor outside the office to calm down and were asked to keep their mood and body in a stable state before and throughout the experiment. The subjects reported their feedback every 10 min from the beginning to the end of the test (the left hand was used for voting on a smartphone). The questions in the questionnaire are shown in Fig. 5 . To simplify the voting operation, the TSV and other indicators ranged from − 30 to 30; these were linearly converted to −3 to 3 in the analysis. When the subjects completed the questionnaire, the experimenter recorded the set temperature displayed on the panel of the prototype and the environmental parameters on the WSZY-1 recorders. 3 Results 3.1 Measurement error analysis of IR sensor The IR images captured by FLIR C2 and MIR8032B1-01 at different distances are shown in Fig. 6 . Although the set temperature in each region of the manikin\u2019s body was consistent, the manikin\u2019s chest and abdomen region temperature in the image was selected as the target temperature during the data analysis to reduce the difficulty of temperature extraction. Skin temperature extraction from the FLIR C2 IR image was also performed using the FLIR Tools software. The mean value was obtained by selecting the target area through the box. Similarly, the skin temperature in the MIR8032B1-01 image was extracted by setting a window corresponding to the number of pixels in the image at different distances and calculating the mean temperature of the pixels in the window as the measured target temperature. In the measurement error analysis, the manikin\u2019s set temperature was defined as the true value, and the error of each IR sensor was obtained by subtracting the true value from the measured temperature. Table 3 summarizes the mean error and standard deviation of the two IR sensors at different measurement distances. As indicated by Table 3, the error of FLIR C2 is considerably smaller than that of MIR8032B1-01, especially at 2 m, with a mean error of only −0.05 °C. At 3 m, the mean error is only −0.26 °C, which is considerably lower than the ±2 °C error mentioned in the manual. Therefore, we believe that FLIR C2 has no distinct systematic error and can accurately measure the surface temperature of an object. Considering the results in Table 3 and the automatic calibration of FLIR C2, no additional error calibration was performed on the data obtained from FLIR C2 in subsequent studies. The temperature measurement accuracy of MIR8032B1-01 and the obtained manikin\u2019s skin temperature were lower than the true values. The mean value and standard deviation of the measurement error increased with the distance. Hence, distance can be concluded as an important factor affecting the accuracy of MIR8032B1-01. In addition to distance, air temperature is another factor that affects the measurement accuracy of the IR sensor. Each subfigure in Fig. 7 corresponds to the change in the error of MIR8032B1-01 with the air temperature at different measurement distances. The results of linear fitting showed no significant linear relationship between the error and air temperature at a measurement distance of 1 m (p-value greater than 0.05). However, a significant relationship was observed at distances 3 and 2 m (p-value = 0.00) although the R2 value corresponding to 2 m was extremely low (distance = 3 m, R2 = 0.283; distance = 2 m, R2 = 0.038). Therefore, the main influencing factor for MIR8032B1-01 is a small measurement distance. However, when the measurement distance exceeds 2 m, the influence of air temperature gradually becomes significant. In practical application scenarios, the measurement distance more probably exceeds 2 m (in the prototype test of this study, the distance is 3 m); therefore, the measurement distance and air temperature must be considered. Data must be calibrated to reduce measurement errors. The measurement distance and air temperature were deemed as the two main influencing factors, and the corresponding relationship between the measurement error and these two factors was explored. The experimental data indicate that a monotonic relationship exists between error and distance (the farther the distance, the greater the error). Moreover, air temperature and error had a linear relationship. Accordingly, multiple linear regressions of error, air temperature, and measurement distance were considered. Table 4 summarizes the results of the regression analysis. Table 4 indicates that the coefficients of all parameters in the multiple linear regression are significant (p-value < 0.05), and the R2 is 0.591. The error calibration method is given by Eqs. (1) and (2): (1) δ T = 0.1206 × T a - 1.7446 × d - 2.9483 (2) T ' = T - δ T where Ta is the air temperature; d is the distance; δT is the error calibration value; T is the sensor measurement value; and T' is the temperature after calibration. The error distributions before and after calibration are shown in Fig. 8 . The mean value of the measurement error after calibration was 0; the error distribution was more concentrated than that before calibration. The root mean square error decreased by 68.9 %. Detailed data are summarized in Table 5 . Although the calibration method reduces the error to a large extent, the error remains between −2 and 2 after calibration; this error is inevitable for low-cost IR sensors. However, with advancements in related industries, a reduction in the cost of high-precision sensors is anticipated to greatly improve the situation. 3.2 Thermal sensation prediction model In this study, we established multiple ML thermal sensation prediction models based on different input parameters. The prediction accuracy of the models is summarized in Table 6 . The list in Table 6 indicates that the prediction accuracy when only the skin temperature is used is low, whereas when only air temperature is considered, high accuracy is achieved. The highest prediction accuracy of the model was achieved when the mean hand, air, and facial temperatures were considered. These results are consistent with those of previous studies [38]. Higher accuracy can be obtained using environmental information compared with employing physiological data. The use of combined data from environmental and physiological sensors can improve the prediction of thermal sensation by 3 %\u20135% compared with exclusively utilizing environmental data. To understand the impact of different features in the same model on the prediction performance, we used the scikit-learn function \u201cfeature_importances_\u201d to calculate the feature importance of the three models with multiple features and accuracy greater than 0.80, as shown in Table 6. The order of the numbers is consistent with the order of the features. The results show that air temperature appears to be the most important in all three models. When the model includes three input parameters of air, hand, and mean facial temperatures, the importance of the three features will be more balanced. 3.3 Performance analysis of air conditioner prototype According to the results in Section 3.2, we chose to apply the model using the air and skin temperatures (from the face and hand) as input parameters into the air conditioner prototype. Although high prediction accuracy can also be achieved using the combination of air and mean facial temperatures or that of air and hand temperatures, we believe that the input of more parameters, implying a more complex model structure, improves model robustness. By testing the air conditioner prototype as described in Section 2.3, environmental parameters, prototype set temperatures, and subjective feedback were collected every 10 min throughout the test. Based on these data, the performance of the prototype was evaluated in terms of objective and subjective factors considering the overall and specific performance. 3.3.1 Overall performance Initially, to prove that the air conditioner prototype can achieve automatic control, the changes in the set temperature during the test were analyzed. Three initial temperature settings were used in this experiment: 22, 26, and 30 °C. Based on experience, 22 °C is a low initial temperature setting of actual air conditioners during summer. This setting not only increases energy consumption but also leads to extremely low indoor temperatures, resulting in cold discomfort. Generally, 30 °C is a high initial temperature setting exceeding the comfort zone of personnel; hence, indoor environment comfort is not ensured. A more suitable temperature setting is 26 °C. These initial values were obtained 10 times in all 30 tests. If the performance of the air conditioner prototype is acceptable, a relatively ideal temperature range is expected to be maintained after it operates for a period, thus avoiding the occurrence of extreme conditions. Accordingly, the frequency of each set temperature in each period (from 0 to 90 min) is recorded, as shown in Fig. 9 . In Fig. 9, the abscissa and ordinate are the time and set temperature, respectively. The size scatter depends on the frequency of occurrence of a specific set temperature at that time point. To express this more directly, the frequency information is marked at the node. The frequency of occurrence of 22 and 30 °C gradually decreases from 10 times (at 0 min) to 6 times (at 90 min). The frequency of occurrence of 26 °C increases from 10 to 11 times. The other temperature settings are between 23 and 29 °C. At 90 min, the number of occurrences of 23, 25, 28, and 29 °C was 1, 2, 3, and 1, respectively. Hence, the air conditioner prototype can be adjudged as capable of achieving a more reasonable automatic temperature adjustment. In some instances, 22 and 30 °C occurred in the final 90 min because of the test conditions. For example, when the initial air and set temperatures were 22 and 30 °C, respectively, and the indoor temperature did not reach the comfort zone of personnel during the 90-min test, the subjects remained in a cold state. Hence, reducing the set temperature of the prototype was unnecessary. Another situation is when the initial air and set temperatures are 30 and 22 °C, respectively. Similarly, the temperature during the entire test did not reach the comfort zone; the personnel remained in a hot state. Consequently, the instruction to raise the set temperature was not given. For these two cases, the former rarely occurs in real life: when the air temperature is extremely low, the personnel are not expected to actively turn on the air conditioner for cooling. The latter may generally occur; however, when the air temperature cannot be lowered after the air conditioner is turned on, the situation is mainly caused by the limited cooling capacity of the air conditioner. Overall, the test results show that the current prototype operates well and can realize reasonable automatic control. For some uncommon situations, a specific analysis considering an actual combination must be implemented. We further suggest that the personnel be allowed to actively make adjustments when the aforementioned situations occur to ensure thermal comfort. The changes in the mean values of the TSV and thermal comfort vote (TCV) of all 30 tests over time are shown in Fig. 10 . The mean TCV decreased significantly from 0 min forward and reached its lowest value at 20 min. However, after 20 min, the TCV generally showed an upward trend. It declined to a certain extent at 50 and 80 min, it reached a maximum of 0.693 at 90 min after 0 min. The reason for the lowest TCV within 20 min was speculated to be related to the initial set value of the air conditioner. For example, when the initial air and set temperatures are 26 and 22 °C, respectively, the overall air temperature tends to drop, and the subjects are in an uncomfortable cold state. Only when the air conditioner operates for a period are the subjects in a cold state. Then, the set temperature is increased to increase the air temperature and improve the comfort of the subjects. The foregoing also indicates that although the experiment can simulate more scenarios, testing real scenarios may be more advantageous to obtain satisfactory performance results. As for why the TCV was highest at the beginning of the test, we believe that the subjects voted as soon as they entered the office; in this instance, the effect on the environment was less. In addition, before the test, the subjects were in the corridor outside the office where the environment was moderate. Consequently, the test participants tended to choose a comfortable option. The mean TSV throughout the test was within the comfort range, −0.5\u20130.5. However, this is most probably because the TSVs for the cold and hot conditions cancel each other out; thus, the mean is approximately 0. Therefore, the mean TSV is insufficient to prove that the performance is acceptable; it must be supported by specific test results. The foregoing analysis indicates that the subjects distinctly experience thermal discomfort when the test duration is 20 min. Therefore, in analyzing the thermal acceptability rate of personnel (thermal acceptability vote (TAV) refers to the proportion of acceptable thermal comfort to the above options), 20 and 90 min were selected for comparison. The statistical results showed that at 20 min, the thermal acceptability rate of the subjects was 80 %, and 13.3 % of the subjects gave a \u201cvery satisfied\u201d rating. At the end of the test (90 min), the thermal acceptability rate of the subjects was 80 %, and the proportion of subjects who gave a \u201cvery satisfied\u201d rating was 30 %. Although the thermal acceptability rate of the personnel was the same at the two moments, the proportion of people who gave the \u201cvery satisfied\u201d rating with regard to the current environment increased by 16.7 %. However, Fig. 11 also shows that the thermal acceptability rate at 90 min was not the highest; this indicator was higher at 0 and 10 min. A possible reason for the foregoing is the same as that when the TCV corresponding to these two moments is high. Nevertheless, at 90 min, the proportion of participants who gave the \u201cvery satisfied\u201d rating was the highest among all the test durations. 3.3.2 Specific experimental performance Section 3.3.1 presents the analysis of the overall performance of the air conditioner prototype and proof that the prototype can achieve automatic control. However, some details may have been overlooked in data processing; hence, separate data analysis for each test is necessary. A summary of the maximum, minimum, and final values of the TSV and TCV at 90 min in each test is shown in Fig. 12 . Yellow and red circles represent the minimum and maximum values of corresponding indicators, respectively, and green stars denote votes at 90 min. Blue shadows correspond to TSV and TCV ranging − 1\u20131 (slightly cool to slightly warm) and 0\u20133 (subjects tend to be comfortable). The votes of subject nos. 1\u20136, 14\u201317, 27, and 28 were in the range\u20131\u20131 throughout the test. At 90 min, the TSV of the other subjects (except for subject nos. 8, 11, 13, 20, 21, and 26) was also between −1 and 1. The TSV of 80 % of the personnel on the air conditioner prototype was maintained between −1 and 1. The TSV of subject no. 11 was less than −1 (poor performance) throughout the test, although a maximum TSV value was reached at 90 min. This situation is most probably related to the low initial air and set temperatures. The TSV values at 90 min were maximum for subject nos. 8 and 13 and minimum for subject nos. 20, 21, and 26 throughout the test. These situations indicate that air conditioners may have unreasonably predicted the thermal sensation for some subjects, leading to unreasonable regulation. Further analysis of individual responses must be conducted. The variations among individuals are more evident in terms of TCV; this is mainly reflected by the fact that the coverage of TCV is significantly larger than that of TSV. The TCV of subject nos. 1, 2, 17, and 27 all exceeded 0 throughout the test. All subjects (except subject nos. 5\u20138, 11, 13, 19\u201322, and 26) tended to have a TCV rating of \u201ccomfortable\u201d at 90 min. This result is generally consistent with the characteristics of TSV; however, between subject nos. 5\u20137, 19, and 22, even a TSV between −1 and 1 does not guarantee comfort among personnel. For example, the voting intervals of subject nos. 5 and 6 were extremely narrow, whereas those of subject nos. 7, 19, and 22 were extremely wide. Therefore, the TSV evaluation can be adjudged as tending to be more uniform, whereas TCV is more influenced by individual preferences. The TSV and TCV values of subject no. 11 are consistently low. However, for subject no. 26, although the TSV is also less than −1, the TCV covers a wide range, −2.5\u20132. The foregoing analysis confirms Humphrey\u2019s view [50] that thermal neutrality is not necessarily equivalent to comfort. The current control logic is based on thermal sensation prediction. Therefore, although the TSV results indicate that the performance is satisfactory, the comfort of personnel is the goal that must be achieved. Although the TCV value is a more suitable indicator for the foregoing, in practice, differences among individuals may lead to inadequate performance if it is directly used for prediction. We also have a reason to believe that with the increase in the amount of data generated by individual feedback, replacing the original group data with specific user data to establish the TCV prediction model is possible. However, more tests are required to determine the amount of data and time necessary for this process. The above analysis focused on the state of subjects at certain time points and found problems in some tests. To explain the causes of these problems, analyzing the process of each test is necessary. The data summary results showed that the set temperature of the prototype was unchanged in 22 of the 30 tests; however, in all the tests, when the initial set value was 26 °C, the set temperature remained unchanged. Accordingly, the tests with a constant set temperature are analyzed first; the results are shown in Figs. 13 and 14 . The subjective and objective data with an initial set temperature of 26 °C are shown in Fig. 13. According to the control logic of the prototype, a constant setting implies that the predicted thermal sensation of the subject is neutral. Compared with the analysis results shown in Fig. 12, the TSV of subject nos. 1\u20136 in the experiment (Fig. 13) is −1\u20131; therefore, the prediction of the air conditioner prototype is accurate for these tests. The TSV of subject nos. 7, 9, and 10 (Fig. 13) is also in the neutral range at the end of the test, whereas that of subject no. 8 was greater than 1 at the last moment. The presumption is that the TSV exceeds the neutral interval and the predicted value is neutral because the time of voting is not consistent with the control time of the air conditioner prototype. Moreover, the time cycle of subjective voting is longer than that of air conditioner automatic control; hence, they are inconsistent. Further, the accuracy of measurement and predictive ability of the model are more probably limited, thus resulting in biases. The TCV results indicate that subject nos. 1\u20134 exhibit similar characteristics. The TCV of subject nos. 1 and 2 rose in the first 20 min and then remained constant at a high level. The TCV of subject no. 3 dropped in the first 10 min (due to air temperature decrease) and then returned to a \u201cvery comfortable\u201d level due to the rise in temperature. The TCV of subject no. 4 also showed an upward trend; however, the increase was relatively small. It gradually increased from the level of \u201clittle uncomfortable\u201d at the beginning to that of \u201clittle comfortable.\u201d The corresponding air temperature and TSV were also relatively stable, with the former remaining at 26 °C and the latter remaining neutral after 40 min. The TCV values of subject nos. 5 and 6 were relatively stable; the equivalent level was neither \u201ccomfortable\u201d nor \u201cuncomfortable.\u201d Moreover, the TSV was in the neutral interval, and the air temperature was relatively stable. The TCV may have fluctuated because these two subjects had no evident preference for hot or cold and tended to vote for a more moderate option. The TCV of subject nos. 7 and 8 exhibited a distinct downward trend, and the TSV of subject no. 7 was below 0 throughout the test. Although the air temperature gradually stabilized at 26 °C, the subjects remained slightly cold, which led to a sharp decline in the TCV from the beginning of the experiment; the subject preferred warm temperatures. Again, this indicates that individual differences cannot be ignored in air conditioning control. Such differences may be physiological or affected by the psychological state of individuals at that time. Subject no. 8 was more sensitive to temperature rise, and the thermal sensation was neutral in the first 60 min, as indicated by the results. As the air temperature gradually increased, the TSV significantly increased, whereas the TCV decreased. These results indicate that the neutral temperature preferred by the subject was relatively low. Moreover, the air conditioner prototype failed to provide effective feedback on the special situation caused by individual differences. For subject nos. 9 and 10, especially subject no. 10, the TSV, TCV, and corresponding air temperature preferences are considerably synchronized. The synchronization of the TSV and air temperature is in line with existing knowledge. The consistency in TCV can be regarded as indicating that the thermal sensation of the subjects in the test is consistently either neutral and hot or neutral and cold. When the temperature becomes extreme, discomfort increases, whereas when the temperature becomes neutral, discomfort decreases. Therefore, the TCV monotonously varies with air temperature. The results when the set temperature does not change during the test and the initial set temperature was 22 or 30 °C are shown in Fig. 14. The default temperature, 26 °C, compared with other temperature values is closer to neutral for most people and more conducive to creating a comfortable thermal environment. However, at 22 and 30 °C, which we consider to be outside the neutral range, if the temperature setting is unchanged, the air temperature may be extremely low or high and does not ensure the comfort of subjects. The results of subject no. 11 were the most unsatisfactory among all the tests. The TSV and TCV were consistently less than − 1 and \u201cuncomfortable\u201d level, respectively. As shown in Fig. 14, the initial air and set temperatures are both approximately 22 °C. Although the TSV and TCV of the subjects were extremely low, the air conditioner was not regulated. After 40 min, subject no. 11 gradually became accustomed to the environment, and the TSV slightly increased to −1. The experimental data are insufficient to provide a convincing explanation for the situation because the air temperature is also an input parameter of the thermal sensation prediction model. Even if the skin temperature is incorrectly measured because the subject\u2019s position may have deviated from the IR temperature measurement window, the low air temperature must guide the air conditioner to increase the set temperature. One possible explanation is that the thermal sensation prediction model is nonlinear; therefore, the prediction is poor for some scenes missing from the training data. In the test, the deviation of the skin or air temperature measurement from the range of the training set leads to a prediction error. The robustness of the model, therefore, requires further improvement. After all, the experiment was only performed when the subjects sat still. The situation can become more complicated if the subjects moved. For effective air conditioning control, we believe that establishing the comfort zone of the set value according to relevant standards and automatically raising (lowering) the set temperature when the air temperature is lower (higher) than a certain value are necessary to avoid similar situations. The set temperature in the test of subject nos. 12\u201317 was 30 °C. A high set temperature value does not indicate high air temperature; the maximum air temperature in these tests does not exceed 28 °C. In particular, for subject no. 12, the maximum air temperature was only 26.15 °C due to the low initial air temperature. The TSV of subject nos. 12 and 13 exceeded 1; however, the maximum value was only 1.3, which was slightly higher than \u201cslightly warm.\u201d Subject nos. 14\u201317 rated the thermal sensation between − 1 and 1 throughout the test. The results of subject no. 14 indicate that although the set temperature exceeds the air temperature, the change in air temperature over time is gradual and virtually remained at 28 °C. This is because the control logic of the air conditioner prototype is not designed for cooling and heating modes. Because the test was conducted in summer, the cooling mode ran throughout the test. In other words, although the temperature setting was 30 °C, the compressor was in an inactive state and did not supply heat to the room. To avoid solar radiation interference, the curtains remained closed; thus, the most likely natural room temperature during the experiment was 28 °C. Only subject no. 13 was sensitive to the hot environment, and the TCV continuously decreased. The TCV of subject no. 14 fluctuated with values corresponding to that between \u201ccomfortable\u201d and \u201cuncomfortable\u201d sensations. The TCV of subject nos. 12, 15, and 16 exhibited an upward trend, and that of subject no. 17 remained high. At the initial setting temperature of 22 °C, the air conditioning performance was generally poor except in the test of subject no. 18. However, note that the main reason for the situation of this subject was that the initial air temperature was relatively high. The temperature dropped throughout the experiment decreased the TSV and then remained constant at approximately 0; in contrast, the TCV showed a moderate upward trend. For subject nos. 19\u201322 with the same low initial air temperatures, the air temperature was even lower than 22 °C. The TSV showed a decreasing trend with increasing air temperature, whereas the TCV decreased more significantly. In these tests, although the subjective feedback of the subjects was not as extreme as that of subject no. 11, it also indicated the poor performance of the air conditioner prototype at low temperatures. To solve this problem, future improvement schemes must be consistent with the foregoing. Further, more studies must be implemented considering two aspects: broadening the coverage scenarios of training data for the thermal sensation prediction model and formulating stricter control strategies. The experimental results shown in Fig. 15 indicate that the air conditioner prototype is controlled according to the prediction of the thermal sensation. In the test of subject no. 23, the initial air temperature was approximately 25 °C, and the prototype was initially set at 22 °C. Because the temperature setting was lower than the air temperature, the air temperature dropped to the lowest value within approximately 40 min. The air conditioner prototype detected changes in the skin temperature of the subject and predicted that the thermal sensation was cold. Thus, the set temperature gradually increased according to the control logic and remained at 25 °C for 60 min. The air temperature then rose to approximately 25 °C, the TSV of the subjects approached 0, and the TCV increased to approximately 3. For subject no. 24, the initial set temperature was consistently lower than the air temperature; consequently, the air temperature continued to decrease and reached the minimum at approximately 50 min; both the TSV and TCV decreased during this period. However, the air conditioner prototype predicted that the thermal sensation of subjects was cold at approximately 40 and 50 min and then gradually increased the set temperature, which remained at 25 °C after 60 min. With an increase in air temperature, the TSV of the subjects approached 0; the TCV also increased. The situation of subject no. 25 is similar to the two foregoing cases, which reflected reductions in TSV and TCV due to the initial decrease in the air temperature. However, the air conditioner prototype adjusted the set temperature; hence, the TSV returned to the neutral interval, and the TCV exhibited an upward trend. The situation of subject no. 26 is more similar to that of subject no. 21, as shown in Fig. 14. The difference is that for subject no. 26, the set temperature increased by 1 °C for 30 min and then remained stable. However, this adjustment had no significant effect. In subsequent tests, the air temperature was approximately 21 °C, and the TSV and TCV of the subjects exhibited a declining trend. The initial set temperature in the tests of subject nos. 27\u201330 was 30 °C; the air conditioner prototype performed well in these four tests. Although the test results of subject no. 27 indicate that the set temperature was adjusted only after 80 min because of the low air temperature, the set temperature of 30 °C had no impact on the environment. Meanwhile, the TSV of the subjects was stable at 0, and the TCV showed an increasing trend. The test results of subject no. 28 were similar, but the air temperature was higher throughout the test. However, after 40 min, the TSV of the subject was in the neutral range, and the TCV changed from \u201cslightly uncomfortable\u201d to neither \u201ccomfortable\u201d nor \u201cuncomfortable.\u201d In contrast, in the tests of subject nos. 29 and 30, the air conditioner prototype adjusted the set temperature earlier than the adjustment of the temperature of aforementioned subject based on the prediction of thermal sensation. Despite the evident fluctuation, the TCV of subject no. 29 was consistently greater than 0, whereas that of subject no. 30 showed a distinct upward trend. The final TSV of both subjects was between 0 and 1. In summary, the overall performance and specific experimental performance of the air conditioner prototype were discussed in detail using subjective and objective parameters. The results show that the air conditioner prototype designed in this study can achieve reasonable automatic adjustment based on thermal sensation prediction. Moreover, the prototype can satisfy the requirements of fundamental use. However, some problems, such as the inadequate adjustment of the prototype to low initial temperature settings, remain. In the future, the thermal sensation prediction model must be further improved to expand its application scope. From the perspective of control, in addition to model-based intelligent control, traditional control logic based on comfort zones must also be considered to cope with unreasonable situations caused by model prediction errors. Many topics worthy of discussion in the experimental design and improvement of the air conditioner prototype in this study are elaborated in Section 4. 4 Discussion The main purpose of this study is to explore the performance of a smart air conditioner with an IR sensor to recognize the thermal state of personnel and automatically adjust the temperature on this basis. According to the results (although not satisfactory for all subjects), favorable feedback on actual situations has been received. The thermal comfort achieved by the current system may not be superior to direct human intervention. However, to our knowledge, our work is the first to apply a thermal sensation identification model based on IR sensors to air conditioners and conduct subject experiments. Compared with model optimization at the theoretical level, this approach has a reference value for the implementation of new technology. To summarize the shortcomings and future development of this study, we expanded our focus to studies without IR sensors and reviewed previous studies on HVAC system control based on recognizing individual requisites. In these studies, HVAC systems usually learn user preferences based on user feedback in the interactive interface [51\u201353] or use physiological parameters measured by wearable devices [54,55] to guide corresponding regulation. Although the actual scenario test duration and evaluation metrics varied from study to study, the results all showed that the thermal comfort of the subjects was improved. The difference between these studies and our study lies in the data collection methods. The use of IR sensors is less invasive than employing wearable devices, such as smart wristbands. Even in a multi-person space, provided that the resolution is sufficient, wearing a specific device is not necessary. A considerable amount of data can be obtained using few devices. Furthermore, the IR temperature measurement process does not require active feedback from personnel and can realize control without affecting daily life and work. However, undeniably, the methods used in some studies require specific body parts using RGB cameras, and potential privacy concerns remain [56]. Kim et al. [30] believe that relevant standards must provide guidelines for such methods. These standards must also resolve privacy and security concerns regarding data collection, data storage, and access. We presume that the extraction of fuzzy personal information from data at the technical level will be the focus of the next stage of research. No unified index for the analysis of the final use performance was also found in studies on the use of comfort identification in HVAC systems. Some studies have focused on the improvement of thermal comfort, whereas others have focused on the reduction of thermal discomfort. The emergence of this situation primarily depends on the experimental design, and the experimental scheme depends on the specific problems confronting research. Notably, this problem exists not only in the system performance evaluation stage but also in the modeling stage; however, the use of a unified approach has not been reached. Martins et al. [32] summarized the performance evaluation indicators of a personal thermal comfort model. As used in this study, accuracy is the most common indicator considered in related research. In most studies, the most widely used resampling technique, whether in hyperparameter tuning or in the final model evaluation stage, is k-fold cross-validation. The foregoing discussion has covered some of the common problems in the current situation, and a scope for improvement exists in the specific content of this study. This content is summarized, and suggestions are proposed for future research and applications. The first problem resolved in this work is to determine whether the temperature measurement results of the IR sensor are accurate. The results of studies on contact skin temperature measurement methods have already been summarized in MacRae et al. [57]. However, the requirements of various indicators of non-contact skin temperature measurement seem to be uncertain. In this study, FLIR C2 (accuracy: ±2 °C or 2 % greater at 25 °C nominal) and MIR8032B1-01 (IR sensor: 80 × 32) were used. We did not obtain information on the accuracy of MIR8032B1-01 from its official manual; the error after calibration was found to be approximately ±2 °C. For FLIR C2, although the official error information is ±2 °C, the measurement error is found to be only 0.14 ± 0.41 °C (1 m distance) in our analysis; moreover, the sensor has an automatic calibration function. Therefore, we believe that FLIR C2 has no evident systematic error, and its measurements are accurate. Accordingly, the measurement accuracy of the IR sensor satisfies the requirements of skin temperature measurement. Related studies have offered their own explanations. Li et al. [41], Aryal et al. [38], and Cosma et al. [39] all used the FLIR Lepton thermal camera (accuracy: ±5 °C; resolution: 0.1 °C). To evaluate the applicability of this low-cost IR sensor, Li et al.[41] compared it with the FLIR T450SC thermal camera (accuracy: ±1 °C or ±1 %). The results show that, in most cases, the difference between the two cameras is within 1 °C, proving the applicability of FLIR Lepton. Aryal et al. [38] also chose FLIR Lepton for their experiment, considering that the device was factory-calibrated and had an automatic calibration function; hence, sensor calibration was not conducted. Cosma et al. [39] believe that consumer-grade thermal cameras are new in the market, and higher-resolution sensors may appear in the future; our opinion is consistent with the foregoing. Furthermore, considering the accuracy of FLIR C2, the thermal sensation prediction model\u2019s performance is not inferior to that of the PMV model [42]. Second, this study failed to achieve thermal comfort identification in a dynamic activity state. Because this study did not explore the recognition of human body parts based on IR images, the subjects were required to sit and remain still during the experiment. This limits the generalization of the conclusions of this study to complex activity scenarios. In this respect, previous studies [36,39,41] provide numerous experiences. The IR sensors are usually located close to the subjects (approximately 1 m), and the main body part recognized is the face, thus reducing the difficulty of body part recognition to a certain extent. In actual scenarios, to reduce cost and cover a wider area, the distance between the IR sensors and subjects may be increased, undoubtedly causing considerable difficulties in the face or hand recognition. In addition, Li et al. [40] proposed a distinction between the front and side of a face in their study. The error caused by object occlusion and distance variation is also a major problem that challenges the robustness of this method. Third, in terms of data, the subjects involved in the collection of IR skin temperature data and those involved in the prototype test experiment were not from the same group of people. In particular, there is an obvious gender ratio difference between the two data sets. The gender ratio of the modeling data is 304 (male): 237 (Female). For the prototype test experiment, the female subjects are more than the male subjects. To explore whether there is a difference between genders, we used the Mann-Whitney U Test to compare the mean facial, hand, and air temperature of male and female data when the TSV is 0, 1, and −1 (9 tests in total). The results showed that there was no significant difference (p-value > 0.05) in the mean facial and hand temperature when TSV is 1 and the air temperature when TSV is −1, and significant differences were found in other cases. From this, it can be inferred that gender may be a factor affecting the application effect of the model, and according to the results in Fig. 15, the proportion of male subjects reached 50 % (higher than the proportion of male subjects in all test experiments), which indicated that the model performed better in the experiment with male subjects. As for the difference between the subject\u2019s clothing insulation, it seems that the higher clothing insulation in the modeling data results in more data with TSV equal to 1 than with TSV equal to −1, leading to a better prediction of \u201chot\u201d sensation, which may also be the reason why there are more cold discomfort situations (e.g., subject no. 11) in this experiment. Though we hope that the effect of clothing insulation will eventually be reflected in skin temperature, it seems that the influence of \u201cexternal\u201d factors such as clothing insulation should also receive more attention during the data collection. In summary, factors such as gender, clothing insulation, and even age need to be considered to further improve the performance of the model. We also hope that more researchers will conduct experiments based on this to make up for the shortcomings of the existing personal comfort model in data diversity. Moreover, considering the limited data provided by each subject, we used the data of all 19 subjects to establish the model. As a result, the thermal sensation prediction model applied is not individual-specific but a population-average model, such as PMV. Although the subjects recruited for the tests were all university students whose BMIs were within a reasonable range, the prediction performance of the model and the effect of the air conditioner could decrease to some extent. However, note that in a multi-person scenario in which the overall environment is adjusted by the HVAC system, if the deviation between the thermal sensation weighted value and the thermal sensation of the individuals is greater than the deviation between the actual thermal sensation and the predicted value of the individuals, then the population-average model may also have valuable use. In addition, the data used for modeling in this study were obtained from a steady-state environment, whereas the prototype test was a dynamic process involving temperature change. Studies have demonstrated that the thermal comfort interval in a dynamic thermal environment is wider than that in a steady-state environment [58]. Whether this difference is reflected in skin temperature or other physiological parameters must be determined through further research. Finally, for the subject experiment carried out in this study, we focused on considering the performance of the prototype in the actual scene. So, the clothing insulation is not strictly controlled. Although we focused on the results of each subject, more empirical studies need to be conducted to enhance the reliability of the conclusions, considering clothing as a possible influencing factor. Another optimization direction of this experiment is the consideration of energy consumption, which is often the focus of studies related to HVAC system control. Because only one household air conditioner was used in this study and the duration of a single experiment was short, the energy consumption data were not monitored. In the future, if the thermal comfort prediction model is applied to a large HVAC system, the analysis of energy consumption data should be paid more attention to. To explore a control strategy capable of achieving comfort and energy savings and verify the actual operation performance, it is necessary to carry out longer-term real-scene data collection or side-by-side experiments used in related research [59]. Accurate thermal demand identification is the focus of the current research. The next step will focus on accurate thermal services. Based on this goal, we believe that PCS is an effective solution. The automated control of PCS is considered as a necessary condition for the simultaneous realization of two system goals: maximum thermal comfort and maximum energy savings [60]. Previous studies have proved that the PCS is an effective means for controlling the local micro-environment [61], and the study of Kim et al. [62] also inspired us to use PCS as a means for determining the personnel\u2019s perception of the environment. The PCS can be used to learn the thermal preferences of occupants based on their control behaviors; this not only enables the collection of a larger dataset and reduces the necessity for long-term feedback from users but also aids in avoiding potential misunderstandings caused by the nuances of questionnaire scales [32]. Notably, Aryal et al. [37] showed that establishing a separate personal thermal comfort model is necessary whether or not a PCS is used. They also explored the performance improvement effect of applying corrective power [63] to the model. This study is anticipated to be an important reference for the promotion of follow-up work. It is a reminder of the urgency of promoting research pertaining to the relationship between local and overall comfort as well as dynamic environmental characteristics using the PCS. 5 Conclusion Personal comfort models and model-based indoor thermal environment control are expected to be the main trends in the field of built environments in the future. This study explored a thermal sensation prediction model based on an IR sensor to measure skin temperature and the entire process of air conditioning control by implementing subject experiments. The main conclusions are as follows. The measurement accuracy of IR sensors affects the prediction performance of human thermal sensations. In this study, artificial climate chamber experiments under different environmental conditions were conducted to analyze the causes of measurement errors, and an error calibration method based on multiple linear regression was established according to the analysis results. This method can effectively reduce the mean and standard deviation of measurement errors, and the root mean square error can be reduced by 68.9 %. Based on the facial and hand temperature data obtained by IR sensors as well as the air temperature and subjective voting data at corresponding times, a data-driven three-category classification thermal sensation prediction model was formulated for multiple feature combinations. The comparison among the models showed that the model with air temperature as the only input parameter could also perform well, whereas the model with skin temperature as the only input parameter exhibited inadequate performance. The prediction accuracy of the model with more parameters was better, and that of the model with air, hand, and mean facial temperatures as input parameters was 0.84. The main innovation of this study is that it applies the thermal sensation prediction model to actual environment control and systematically tests the performance of the air conditioner prototype through subjective and objective experiments. The experimental results showed that the prototype could automatically regulate the temperature setting according to the prediction of thermal sensation, and the frequency of cold and hot temperature settings decreased with time. The overall subjective feedback results showed that the mean TSV of the entire test was in the comfort zone of −0.5\u20130.5, and the mean TCV showed a rising trend 20 min after the beginning of the experiment and reached its highest value at the end of the experiment. When the thermal acceptability remained unchanged, the \u201cvery satisfied\u201d rating of the subjects also increased by 16.7 %. In view of some cases of poor performance, this study focuses on the process of specific experiments and discusses the causes and improvement schemes in detail.

        "dc:description": "The accurate identification of the real-time thermal state of personnel working indoors has been the focus of researchers. In this study, a detailed examination of the entire process of developing a personal comfort model, from theory to practice, is conducted. In particular, the subject of this investigation is a smart air conditioner capable of predicting thermal sensation based on an infrared (IR) sensor that measures the skin temperature of personnel and then implements automatic control. Random forest algorithm was employed to establish a thermal sensation prediction model, which accepts skin and air temperatures as input parameters. The model achieves a high prediction accuracy value of 0.84. Given the measurement errors of low-cost IR sensors, a simulated temperature measurement experiment based on the manikin was conducted, and an error calibration method based on multiple linear regression was developed through the experiment. 30 subjects participated in another prototype test experiment, which proved that the air conditioner can accomplish effective automatic control based on the prediction of thermal sensation, avoid the occurrence of extreme temperatures, and ensure the thermal comfort of personnel. The possible causes of remaining problems and potential improvement schemes are discussed in detail.",
