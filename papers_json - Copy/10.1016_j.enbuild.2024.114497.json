Architecture and Regional Planning IIT Kharagpur West Bengal India The potential of Micro-Zonal Occupant Centric Control (MZOCC) to save HVAC energy consumption in medium sized open-plan offices has been established in literature. This is done by virtually dividing a thermal zone into micro-zones and allowing independent diffuser-level control in each micro-zone when the micro-zone is occupied. In continuation, there is a need to ensure that thermal comfort is achieved within micro-zones under such localised control. This is important because several forms of discomfort such as draft, horizontal thermal asymmetry and vertical thermal gradients may arise in MZOCC. Further, the effect of MZOCC airflow control strategies, such as setback flow and setback temperature, which were proposed in previous studies on thermal comfort of occupants needs to be evaluated. In an attempt to address these research gaps, this study explores thermal comfort for different scenarios of diffuser arrangements, airflow control strategies and occupancy conditions and also explores the effect of varying supply velocities used in setback flow and setpoint temperatures used as setback temperatures on air distribution and thermal comfort. Results show that low PMV values, increased draft discomfort and heavy thermal gradients are observed for certain scenarios of MZOCC. Tuning airflow control by choosing appropriate setback flow or setback temperature helps in restoring thermal comfort. As different forms of discomfort are observed in different cases, it is important to plan micro-zones and control airflow, such that, MZOCC does not violate thermal comfort criteria while optimising energy efficiency. This study gives a framework for selecting appropriate airflow control strategies for a selected diffuser arrangement for a given occupancy condition. Comfort-based MZOCC that uses appropriate airflow control strategy saves about 60% energy when the zone is half occupied and about 85% energy when the zone is quarter occupied. Results also show that, improving the diffuser arrangement improves energy savings and increases the options of airflow control strategies that can be used. Also, different airflow control strategies behave differently for each diffuser arrangement and has to be chosen separately for given diffuser setting and occupancy condition. Keywords Micro-Zonal Occupant Centric Control (MZOCC) Thermal comfort, Open-plan offices Energy efficiency Setback temperature Setback flow Draft 1 Introduction Micro-Zonal Occupant-Centric Control (MZOCC) reduces energy wastage by air conditioning only the occupied regions of a thermal zone [1]. Previous studies on MZOCC highlight its energy saving potential [2,3] and economic viability [4], however, only limited studies have evaluated thermal comfort in micro-zones. Previous studies have shown that micro-zoning can reduce comfort violations [5,6], but this was stated under the assumption that micro-zonal boundaries are adiabatic with no thermal interaction between micro-zones. Recent studies highlight that inter-micro-zonal interactions influence air jet trajectories and cooling pattern [1]. This may even lead to over cooling due to unwanted merging of jets [4]. Another study analysed the thermal perceptions of occupants to allot seats to occupants in a co-working office such that temperature setpoints in each micro-zone can be maintained as per the thermal perception of the group of occupants seated there. But the study assumed that the air temperature and velocity within a micro-zone is uniform and the thermal sensation experienced at all points in the micro-zone is the same [3,7\u20139]. But, recent studies that used experimentally validated CFD simulations show that regions of high and low air temperature and velocities are present within micro-zones [4]. This may lead to thermal discomfort due to thermal asymmetry and draft. Hence, there is a need to evaluate thermal comfort and discomfort under MZOCC by considering the transient thermal exchanges across virtual boundaries and variations in temperature and velocity within micro-zones. Such an in-depth analysis will help in developing strategies for ensuring thermal comfort under MZOCC. Previous studies suggest that factors such as (1) supply air velocity [10], (2) distance between diffusers [10], (3) ambient conditions [1] and (4) relative location of occupied micro-zones [1] influence the airflow in the zone. Considering these, two strategies have been proposed to avoid concentration of cool air at certain regions in the micro-zone. These are (1) using a setback flow or (2) using a setback temperature in the unoccupied micro-zones [4]. The setback conditions can be applied to all unoccupied micro-zones or to the unoccupied micro-zones adjacent to the occupied micro-zones depending on the required spread of air jets. These studies assumed a fixed supply velocity for setback flow and setpoint temperature for setback temperature. Hence there is no clarity on how air distribution within micro-zones varies on changing the setback conditions. Furthermore, previous studies on zonal air-conditioning suggest that thermal comfort may be achieved before reaching the set-point [11]. Hence, there is also a need to evaluate the energy saving potential on using a comfort-based MZOCC with respect to a set-point based MZOCC. The research questions this study wishes to address are: (1) Is thermal comfort achieved under MZOCC? What are the forms of discomfort within micro-zones? (2) How can MZOCC strategies be tuned to improve thermal comfort? (3) How much energy can be saved by using a strategized comfort-based MZOCC? Though the study area (i.e., the open-plan layout considered) and method used in analysing air-distribution in this study are similar to the previous publication of the authors [4], there are remarkable differences in the objective and contributions. While the previous work focused on attaining a pre-decided set-point temperature (i.e., 23 °C) in the occupied micro-zones using MZOCC, this study aims at attaining thermal comfort using PMV equation that uses air-temperature, velocity and humidity as input. Such a comfort-based control is observed to save 15 % more energy than a set-point based control. Further, the previous study introduced the potential of setback flow and setback temperature in altering air-jet trajectories and improving MZOCC. But a fixed setback flow and setback temperature was considered. This study delves deeper into analysing how changing the supply velocities in setback flow and setpoint temperatures of setback temperature influences air distribution and thermal comfort. Results show that tuning the setback conditions considering diffuser arrangement and occupancy improves thermal comfort and energy savings. Further, while the previous study only analysed temperature contours in the zone, this study analyzes thermal discomfort due to draft, horizontal and vertical gradients under diffuser arrangement and airflow strategies in addition to PMV contours, to give a comprehensive understanding on how supply airflow is to be modulated for different scenarios to achieve maximum energy savings without compromising thermal comfort. Thus, this study builds on existing literature and enhances MZOCC by giving a framework to maximise energy savings by considering thermal comfort as a constraint to be attained. The study puts forth two novel contributions. First, by analysing thermal comfort, the study shows that mere smart operation of diffusers based on occupancy cannot yield comfortable indoor conditions. Unplanned MZOCC may lead to uncomfortable conditions and energy wastage. Well-planned micro-zones with strategized airflow control are required to attain comfort within micro-zones. Second, the study gives a method of strategizing MZOCC by tuning setback flow and setback temperature in unoccupied micro-zones. Thus, along with highlighting the need for considering thermal comfort while planning MZOCC to reduce HVAC energy consumption, the study also gives a framework that can be used to select appropriate micro-zonal diffuser arrangements and airflow strategies. 2 Literature review ASHRAE 55 prescribes standards for evaluating comfort through predicted mean votes (PMV), predicted percentage of dissatisfaction (PPD), minimum horizontal and vertical temperature gradients, and percentage of dissatisfaction (PD) due to draft [12]. The PMV model was developed by Fanger in the 1970 s following extensive field studies and provides a mathematical expression to calculate thermal comfort. Six variables\u2014air temperature, mean radiant temperature, air velocity, humidity, metabolic rate, and clothing insulation of occupants\u2014are used to estimate the average thermal sensation of a large group of occupants in the form of a thermal comfort vote, termed as the 'Predicted Mean Vote\u2019 (PMV) [13]. The personal variables such as metabolic rate and clothing insulation may not vary drastically for people dressed in similar clothes doing mild sedentary activity in an office and are usually assumed constant. But the environmental variables may vary drastically within a zone if the space is not uniformly air-conditioned. MZOCC tries to cool only the occupied region in large rooms, hence, the indoor conditions at different regions of the room will be different. This transient variation in air temperature, velocity and humidity needs to be modelled accurately to evaluate thermal comfort within micro-zones. In addition, two types of discomfort may arise under MZOCC. First is discomfort due to horizontal or vertical thermal asymmetry [12]. In typical full-zone conditioning, diffusers are appropriately spaced to ensure good diffusion of cool air with the room air. Air diffusion performance index (ADPI) measures how effectively cool air spreads in the zone. Spaces with ADPI above 80 % indicates a space with well mixed air with homogeneous indoor thermal condition without discomfort due to thermal gradients [14]. MZOCC on the other hand aims at heterogenous cooling of the zone and hence ADPI may not be applicable. Thermal gradients are caused in MZOCC due to the attachment of cool air jets to adjacent surfaces, ceilings or convergence of air jets that concentrates cool air at the occupied region below the supply diffuser. Cool air jets from supply diffusers initially spread in all directions, but, in the absence of attractive forces from adjacent sides, air jets concentrate on a small region in the occupied zone, which leads to very low temperature in the concentrated zone and high temperature in the remaining region [4]. In typical full zone conditioning, cool air from adjacent diffusers provides the required attractive forces that prevents such convergence of air jets. The behaviour of cool air jets to converge or attach to nearby surfaces and concentrate in small regions under MZOCC have been detailed in a previous publication of the authors [4]. Furthermore, when the distance between supply diffusers are less, air jets are observed to merge and move away from its expected path [4]. Merging of air jets and attachment of cool air to surfaces are a concern in full-zone conditioning also, but, as the entire zone is conditioned, this leads to a cooler temperature near the ceilings and comfortable temperatures in the occupied zone. This is experimentally proven in an earlier work of the authors [15]. But in MZOCC, cool air jets are directed towards the occupants, hence merging of air jets increases the air velocity and contributes towards the second form of discomfort \u2013 draft. Draft is asserted to be more prominent in MZOCC than zone level OCC. Using a setback flow or a low velocity flow in unoccupied micro-zones increases the spread of air jets [4]. This is because, low velocity air jets get deflected off towards high velocity air jets due to pressure drop between the air jets and reduced momentum of low velocity jets. This deflection leads to merging of low velocity air jets from unoccupied micro-zone with the high velocity air jets of occupied micro-zones in the occupied micro-zone. Hence, the temperature difference and variations in air velocities experienced in the micro-zone are reduced due to increased spread of the combined air jets. In setback-flow, the air-temperature attained within unoccupied micro-zones is not usually monitored as the objective is to continuously provide low velocity air-jets to influence the spread of the air-jets in the occupied micro-zone. The spread of air jets can be asserted to change with change in the velocity of setback flow. On the other hand, maintaining a setback temperature or a high setpoint temperature in the unoccupied micro-zones ensures that a required temperature is attained in the unoccupied regions. The supply air-velocity in unoccupied micro-zones is same as that of occupied micro-zones until the setback temperature is attained in the unoccupied micro-zones, after which, the diffusers in the unoccupied micro-zones are switched off. Hence, high velocity air is supplied to unoccupied micro-zones for a short duration to attain setback temperature. This lowering of air temperature in unoccupied micro-zones reduces the variations in air temperature across micro-zones compared to air-conditioning only the occupied micro-zone. This also reduces loss of cool air from occupied to unoccupied micro-zones by controlling inter-micro-zonal interactions through the virtual boundaries [4]. This air distribution within and across micro-zones may vary based on changes in the temperature set as setback temperature. 3 Method From literature, it can be asserted that using setback flow or a setback temperature helps in reducing thermal gradients and draft, and improving thermal comfort. This brings forth the question on which all micro-zones should setback conditions be applied to and what are the optimal setback conditions? Literature shows that though applying setback flow to all unoccupied micro-zones aid in increasing the spread of air jets, this can also lead to unwanted merging of air jets and attachment of cool air to the ceiling [4]. Hence applying setback flow only in the micro-zones adjacent to the occupied micro-zone is observed to save more energy in a typical Indian open-plan office [4]. Further, previous studies used a fixed setback flow, but variations in supply velocities of setback flow can also influence thermal comfort and energy consumption. Hence, there is a need to explore the effect of varying supply velocities of setback flow on air distribution and thermal comfort. In contrast to setback flow, literature states that maintaining setback temperature in all unoccupied micro-zones is more effective than applying it only in micro-zones adjacent to occupied micro-zones [4]. This is because setback temperature in all unoccupied micro-zones reduces the overall air temperature of the zone and this reduces the loss of cool air from occupied to unoccupied micro-zones. Again, a fixed setback temperature was used in the previous study [4] and hence, there is a need to explore how variations in setback temperature influences inter-micro-zonal interaction, thermal comfort and energy consumption. Hence, this study evaluates and compares the effect of maintaining setback flow and setback temperatures in all unoccupied micro-zones and only in micro-zones adjacent to the occupied micro-zones for varying setback flows and varying setback temperatures. This will help in understanding the effects of these parameters on airdistribution and aid in strategizing OCC within micro-zones. The aim of this study is to use experimentally validated transient CFD models to evaluate thermal comfort and discomfort within micro-zones and develop a method to plan MZOCC such that thermal comfort is achieved. The objectives are to (1) evaluate thermal comfort under different (a) micro-zonal configurations, (b) micro-zonal airflow strategies and (c) occupancy conditions and (2) explore the effect of supply velocity and setpoint temperature in setback flow and setback temperature, respectively. The study follows a two-stage approach where a parametric analysis is performed to evaluate thermal comfort and discomfort under MZOCC using a validated CFD model in the first stage, and, the effect of setback flow and setback temperature on thermal comfort are evaluated in the second stage. The energy consumed while using comfort-based MZOCC is also evaluated in the second stage. 3.1 Parametric analysis 3.1.1 Details of the CFD model Field study experiments are performed in a typical open-plan office in India to develop and validate the CFD model. The office is located in Cochin, India, which falls under a warm and humid climatic zone. The details of the experiment are elaborated in a previous publication of the authors [4] and is briefly described here. Two hot-wire anemometers and 18 DHT22 sensors are mounted on measuring poles and furniture to measure the inlet and outlet supply air velocity, temperature and humidity, and ambient indoor conditions at different parts of the room. A measuring pole has DHT22 sensors placed at 0.6 m, 1.1 m and 1.8 m from the floor following ASHRAE standard locations to measure air temperature at ankle height, breathing height and standing height of occupants [16]. Four such poles are used and testo hotwire thermo-anemometers are mounted on two of the poles at a distance of 0.2 m below the supply diffusers to measure the diffuser boundary conditions. Remaining DHT22 sensors are placed on the furniture in the office. All readings are recorded every 2 s and stored in a cloud drive using ESP8266 micro-controller coded using Arduino IDE. In the previous publication [4], a CFD model was validated using sensor readings of air-temperature and velocity. In this study, in addition to modelling air temperature and velocity, humidity is also modelled in CFD by activating the species transport equation given in Equation (1) and compared against the humidity sensor readings sensed and stored using DHT22 temperature humidity sensor. The sensor has a sensing error of ± 2 %. (1) ∂ ρ ∂ t ρ Y i + ∇ . ρ → v Y i = ∇ . → J i + R i + S i Where, Y i is the local mass fraction of water vapour (Yi) present in air. Ri is the rate of production of water vapour through chemical reaction Si is the rate of creation of water vapour through addition Ji is the diffusion flux of water vapour. The heat sources, boundary conditions and numerical scheme used in CFD are similar to the previous study [4]. These are briefly repeated here for clarity. Occupants are assumed to emit 75 W/person, 180 W/personal computer and 120 W/light following literature [17]. The supply air temperature is set as 13 °C. The study uses the Eulerian method in CFD, where entire room is discretised into discrete control volumes and the equations of conservation of mass, momentum and energy are solved for each control volume to estimate the transfer of air-temperature, velocity and pressure across each control volume. The turbulence model used is RNG K-epsilon with enhanced wall function that helps in modelling the two-layer turbulence model [18]. Finite volume discretization scheme is used with an unstructured tetrahedral mesh. Humidity is modelled using a species transport model that estimates the transfer of water-vapour across each control volume. Indoor air is assumed to be warm and humid and the incoming supply air from diffusers are assumed as cool and dry. Radiation is modelled using discrete ordinates method. SIMPLE algorithm is used to handle the pressure velocity coupling. Inlets, outlets and all surfaces are considered as boundaries. Experimental data collected near the diffusers are used to model inlet boundary conditions. Momentum method is used to model inlets as it is best suited for modelling square ceiling diffusers compared to other methods [19]. The initial room conditions are set at an air temperature of 30 °C with a humidity level of 60 %. The comparison of air temperature, velocity and humidity readings obtained from sensors readings and CFD model is shown in Fig. 1 . The CFD model has an error of ± 0.6 °C for air temperature, ±0.1 m/s for velocity and ± 5 % for humidity and is acceptable compared to sensor error of ± 0.5 °C, ±0.1 m/s, ±2 % respectively. These are considered acceptable following literature that state that a temperature difference of ± 1 °C [20], velocity difference of ± 0.15 m/s [17] and humidity difference of ± 5 % [21] does not limit the capability of the CFD model to predict these variables. Further, from Fig. 1, it is also evident that despite the error, the CFD model accurately predicts the transient trends in the sensed variables. Hence, this validated CFD model is used to explore thermal comfort under varying parametric conditions. 3.1.2 Evaluation of thermal comfort Thermal comfort is evaluated using ASHRAE 55 Predicted Mean Vote (PMV). PMV gives the mean thermal sensation experienced by a group of people in the given thermal setting. This is computed using Equations 2\u20137 and gives a value ranging from −3 to +3 (cold to hot) with 0 indicating thermal comfort. For comfortable conditions, PMV must lie between ± 0.5 [12]. (2) PMV = L ∗ 0.303 ∗ E x p - 0.036 ∗ M + 0.028 Where, (3) L = M - W - 3.05 ∗ 10 - 3 . 5733 - 6.99 ∗ M - W - p a - 0.42 ∗ [ M - W - 58.15 ] - 1.7 ∗ 10 - 5 ∗ M ∗ 5867 - p a - 0.0014 ∗ M ∗ 34 - t a - 3.96 ∗ 10 - 8 ∗ f c l ∗ [ ( t c l + 273 ) 4 - ( t r ¯ + 273 ) 4 ] - f c l * h c * ( t c l - t a ) (4) tcl = 35.7 - 0.028 M - W - R c l ∗ { 3.96 ∗ 10 - 8 ∗ f c l ∗ t c l + 273 4 - tr ¯ + 273 4 + f c l ∗ h c ∗ ( t c l - t a ) (5) Rcl = I c l ∗ 0.155 (6) fcl = 1.05 + 0.1 ∗ I c l (7) hc = 12.1 ∗ V ar Where, M − metabolic rate (W/m2). W − the effective mechanical power (W/m2). Icl − the clothing insulation, in square metres kelvin per watt (m2 ⋅ K/W). fcl − the clothing surface area factor. ta − the air temperature, in degrees Celsius (°C). tr ¯ - the mean radiant temperature, in degrees Celsius (°C). V ar - the relative air velocity, in metres per second (m/s). pa − the water vapour partial pressure, in pascals (Pa). hc − the convective heat transfer coefficient, in watts per square metre kelvin [W/(m2⋅K)]; tcl − the clothing surface temperature, in degrees Celsius (°C). As per ASHRAE 55 the maximum temperature difference between head and ankle is 3 °C for seated occupants and 4 °C for standing occupants. The percentage of people dissatisfied by draft is calculated using Equation (8) [22]. (8) PD = 34 - T a ( V - 0.05 ) 0.62 ( 0.37 V . T u + 3.14 ) Where, Ta is the is the air temperature in °C. V is the air velocity in m/s Tu is the turbulence intensity. Transient Tu values at every point in the computational domain are obtained from CFD results. 3.1.3 Scenarios used in parametric analysis Three scenarios of diffuser arrangement, three scenarios of occupancy conditions and three scenarios of airflow strategies with three variations of setback flow and setback temperature are analysed. The objective of the analysis is to understand how thermal comfort and discomfort varies under different scenarios to understand the effect of these different parameters. The three diffuser arrangements and occupancy conditions follow the scenarios discussed in the previous publication of the authors [4] and is briefly reiterated here for clarity. D1 represents the typical conditions existing in the thermal zone, D2 represents the scenario where diffusers are rearranged according to the functional planning of the space, and D3 represents the scenario where additional diffusers are added to micro-zone the room by taking into account the functional planning of the room. The occupancy scenarios are: (O1) when the entire zone is occupied, which corresponds to 100 % occupancy, (O2) when only half of the zone is occupied which corresponds to 50 % occupancy and (O3) when only one micro-zone is occupied which corresponds to 25 % occupancy. These diffuser arrangements and regions where occupants are present for the occupancy scenarios are shown in Fig. 2 . First two airflow scenarios are the (A1) typical conditions where the entire zone is conditioned and (A2) when only the occupied micro-zone is conditioned. A3 corresponds to the airflow strategy where a setback flow is used in unoccupied micro-zones. Two options of the same are explored, where in 3a, setback flow is maintained in only one unoccupied micro-zone adjacent to the occupied micro-zone. In 3b, setback flow is maintained in all unoccupied micro-zones. Similarly, airflow strategy A4 corresponds to maintaining setback-temperature, with 4a maintaining setback temperature in the micro-zone adjacent to the occupied micro-zone and 4b maintaining setback temperature in all unoccupied micro-zones. The parameters are shown in Table 1 . The effect of the variations in the supply velocity of setback flow and setpoint temperature of setback temperature are also explored as detailed in section 3.2.1. PMV, PD and vertical thermal contours are evaluated at points V1 and V2 for O2 and O3 conditions respectively. In O2 cases, 10 occupants are present in two tables, each accommodating 5 occupants. V1 is a point between the two tables, within the micro-zonal boundary and placed at a distance from the diffusers in the micro-zone, but near the occupants. This is also the point where draft discomfort have the highest probability of occurrence, as air jets from the two diffusers may merge. Hence, evaluating comfort conditions at V1 is asserted to aid in understanding the discomfort experienced by occupants. Similarly, V2 is a point used in O3 cases and is located within the micro-zonal boundary near the occupants, where thermal gradients are highly probable. Though thermal gradients and draft may be experienced in other points as well, V1 and V2 are taken for the preliminary analyses of thermal comfort. PMV contours are later plotted in the breathing level to evaluate whether thermal comfort is violated in other locations. 3.2 Comfort-based MZOCC analysis 3.2.1 Variations in setback flow and setback temperature Total 12 airflow control strategies are explored which corresponds to exploring three different velocities for (A3) setback flow and three different setpoint temperatures for (A4) setback temperature, with each exploring the effect of maintaining (a) setback conditions only in the unoccupied micro-zones adjacent to the occupied zone or (b) setback conditions in all unoccupied micro-zones. Personalised ventilation systems, that uses special air handling units or fans placed near occupants to create micro-comfort zones around occupants, typically uses a supply velocity of 0.25 m/s [23]. This is about 50 % of the actual supply velocity of overhead diffusers. Following this, velocities about 1\u20131.5 m/s lower and higher than 0.25 m/s are used as supply velocities in setback flow. Previous studies on zone level OCC have used a setback temperature of 27 °C, which was 3 °C higher than set-point temperature [24]. The set-point temperature used in this study is 23 °C and hence setback temperatures 25 °C, 26 °C and 28 °C are used in the analysis. These are given in Table 1. 3.2.2 Estimating energy consumption Comfort-based controllers can reduce energy consumption compared to set-point based controllers because thermal comfort is often achieved even before reaching the set-point conditions. Energy consumed by the HVAC system is estimated by adding the energy required to achieve thermal comfort ( E comfort ) and energy required to maintain thermal comfort ( E maintenance ). It is assumed that comfort conditions are met when PMV = 0 while calculating energy consumption. E comfort and E maintenance are estimated by multiplying the power required for cooling ( P comfort ) and maintaining cooling ( P maintenance ) with the corresponding duration of operation and the total energy is estimated using Equation (9). The power consumed at any instance is the sum of cooling power ( P cooling ) plus fan power ( P fan ) which is calculated using Equations (10), 11 and 12. The ventilation required for comfortable conditions ( Q outdoor ) is estimated following ASHRAE 62.1 [25] using Equation (13). The airflow required to maintain thermal comfort is evaluated using Equation (14). (9) E Total = P comfort ∗ T comfort + P maintenance ∗ T operation - c o m f o r t (10) P = P cooling + P fan (11) P cooling = Q ∗ h r - h s (12) P fan = γ Q ∗ Δ p 3600 ∗ 1000 ∗ η (13) Q outdoor = R p ∗ O + R a ∗ A zone (14) m s = ( Q sr C pm t i - t s ) E Total is the total energy consumed when the space is conditioned for one hour; P is the power consumed and T is the duration of operation; Q is the volumetric flow rate; h r and h s are the return and supply enthalpies; γ is the specific weight of air (taken as 2.09 N/m3 for 13 °C); Δ p is the total fan pressure (assumed 750 Pa); η is the efficiency of the fan (assumed as 70); Rp is volumetric flow required per person; O is the number of occupants; R a is the flow per square meter to remove toxic gases, which is 0.06 CFM/ft2 for office spaces; A zone is the area of the occupied zone; m s is the mass flow rate to maintain cooling and Q sr is the heat generated in the micro-zone; C pm is the humid specific heat of moist air; t i and t s are the indoor and supply temperatures respectively. 4 Results 4.1 Thermal comfort for different scenarios The transient PMV pattern at points V1 and V2 in the occupied micro-zone for occupancy cases O2 and O3 respectively are given in Fig. 3 . Points V1 and V2 are shown in Fig. 2. For all O2 cases, (i.e. when only half of the zone is occupied), PMV values are observed to be high when only the occupied micro-zone is conditioned (A2) for all diffuser arrangements. Though the use of airflow strategies such as setback flow and setback temperature can reduce the time taken to achieve comfort for all O2 cases, this is not true for the cases when only a quarter of the zone is occupied (O3 cases). As seen in Fig. 3, for case D1O3, supplying setback flow in micro-zones adjacent to occupied micro-zones (A3a) increases the time taken to achieve comfort and similar is the situation for supplying setback flow in all micro-zones (A3b) for case D3O3. This is because in D3A3bO3, using a setback flow also leads to unwanted merging of air jets, deviating air-jets from the occupied region and leading to increase in time to reach PMV = 0. Nonetheless, this time is lower than the time taken to reach setpoint (23 °C). The time taken to reach set-point conditions are detailed in the previous publication [4]. This indicates that switching the air-conditioner from high power cooling mode to low power maintenance mode following PMV values can improve both comfort and energy efficiency. It is to be noted that while using a setback temperature (A4), in few cases such as cases D1A4aO2, D2A4bO2, D3A4aO3, the PMV values do not immediately drop after reaching PMV = 0 unlike other strategies. This is due to increased inter-micro-zonal interaction from adjacent micro-zones and cool air from occupied micro-zones are lost to unoccupied micro-zones through the virtual boundaries. Hence in such cases, the air-conditioning system has to continue operating in high-power cooling mode and can only shift to low power maintenance mode after PMV starts to drop below −0.5. For clarity, PMV contours at the breathing level (1.1 m height from floor) and section AA\u2019 and BB\u2019 for O2 and O3 cases respectively are plotted for the time at which thermal comfort is attained within occupied micro-zones and is shown in Fig. 4 . As observed, under full zone conditioning (O1), the zone is overcooled to 20 °C leading to PMV < -1 at several parts of the room. For the case with typical diffuser arrangement (D1), warm discomfort is also observed near few occupants as seen in the section given in Fig. 4b. For D2 and D3 cases, attachment of cool air to the walls leads to PMV < -1.25 near the walls. This clearly indicates cold discomfort and energy wastage. For scenarios when only half of the zone is occupied (O2), airflow strategy A2 (in which cool air is supplied only in the occupied micro-zone) is observed to create regions of cold discomfort (PMV < -1.25) within occupied micro-zones and comfortable conditions (PMV with ± 0.5) in unoccupied regions. This throws light on why it takes more time to reach comfort when only the occupied micro-zone is conditioned (A2). The entire zone is conditioned through the air supplied in the occupied micro-zone before achieving comfortable conditions around the occupants. Hence, A2 is not a good MZOCC strategy for O2 cases. Airflow strategy A3a is found to suit D2 and D3 diffuser arrangements, whereas, using it in D1 leads to cold and warm discomfort within occupied micro-zones. At the same time, strategy A3b leads to warm discomfort in D1 and D2, and cold discomfort in D3. This is because, excessive merging of cool air with setback flow leads to unwanted deflection leading to concentrated regions with PMV < -1, while other regions have warm discomfort. For 25 % occupancy, i.e., O3 cases, in contrast to the observations made in O2 cases, A2 strategy is found suitable for D3. The reduced size of micro-zone and corner location of micro-zone may be the reason for this. The corner walls block the free movement of cool air to unoccupied regions and hence the occupied micro-zone is conditioned before the unoccupied regions. This is clearly observed in the plan and section shown in Fig. 4a&b where it is observed that the occupied region has attained comfort when the unoccupied region has a PMV > 1. Strategies A3a is found suitable for all diffuser arrangements whereas, A3b leads to uncomfortable conditions. While using a setback flow, the air temperature in the unoccupied micro-zones varies from 28 °C to 23 °C. As setback flow influences the spread of air jets, it is continued until comfort is achieved within the occupied micro-zone irrespective of the temperature in the unoccupied regions. For the strategy of using setback temperature, A4a and A4b are found efficient in maintaining comfortable conditions for O2 cases. Cooling the region around the occupied micro-zone or entire zone to the setback temperature (i.e., 4a and 4b respectively), reduces the inter-micro-zonal interaction and loss of cool air to unoccupied regions. For O3 conditions, as the size of micro-zone reduces, strategy A4b leads to better thermal comfort distribution with PMV within ± 0.5 than A4a. These observations are similar to the observations discussed in the previous study that analysed the temperature contours under diffuser airflow conditions [4]. This may be due to the significant effect of air-temperature on PMV evaluation. To understand the effect of air-velocity, the percentage of people dissatisfied due to draft is estimated using Equation (8) and plotted in Fig. 5 . Conditioning only the occupied micro-zone (A2) has PD > 20 % indicating draft discomfort for 50 % occupancy (O2) for most cases and reduces below 20 % only for short durations. This trend is similar to the PMV trend discussed. Using setback flow in all unoccupied micro-zones leads to excessive merging of air-jets and leads to PD > 20 %. It is noteworthy that for O3 occupancy, though A3b (setback flow in micro-zones adjacent to the occupied micro-zone) reaches PMV = 0 after cooling for 14 mins, direct flow of high velocity air on occupants increases the PD value to be above 20 % as shown in Fig. 5. This shows that even when PMV is within the comfort limits, discomfort due to draft can exist within occupied micro-zones. Hence it is important to separately estimate different discomfort indices. The air temperature along lines AA\u2019 and BB\u2019 for O2 and O3, respectively, are plotted to analyse the horizontal temperature asymmetry. Similarly, the air temperature along lines V1 and V2 are plotted to analyse vertical thermal gradients. Lines AA\u2019, BB\u2019, V1, and V2 are shown in Fig. 2. A temperature difference greater than 3 °C within the occupied micro-zone indicates thermal discomfort due to horizontal asymmetry. Similarly, discomfort due to vertical thermal gradients arises when the temperature between the head and ankle is greater than 3 °C for seated occupants or greater than 4 °C for standing occupants [12]. Fig. 6 shows the horizontal temperature variations at a height of 1.1 m from floor along AA\u2019 and BB\u2019 for O2 and O3 respectively. The dotted vertical lines in Fig. 6 indicate the start and end of occupied micro-zone. Conditioning only the occupied micro-zone (A2) is observed to increase the temperature difference across the micro-zone for all diffuser arrangements and occupancy conditions. D1A2O2, DA2O2 and D3A2O3 have a temperature difference greater than 4 °C indicating thermal asymmetry on a person in the micro-zone. For O3 cases, 3 °C temperature difference is observed for few cases of D1 and D2. Though high temperature difference is observed for D3A2O3 along line AA\u2019 through the zone, the temperature variations within the occupied micro-zone is only about 0.5 °C. This reinforces the earlier observation that A2 strategy is good for small micro-zones located in a corner of the room. Using setback-flow in micro-zones adjacent to the occupied micro-zone was found to achieve PMV = 0 for D1O2 case after 10 min of air-conditioning, but the results of thermal gradient analysis show that a person in this micro-zone experiences a temperature variation of 4 °C on moving within the micro-zone which leads to thermal discomfort. Similar is the case of D3A4bO2. For D2O3 cases, airflow strategies A1, A2, A4a and A4b lead to temperature difference greater than 3 °C leading to discomfort due to horizontal thermal gradients. Fig. 7 shows the vertical temperature along a vertical line at points V1 and V2 in the occupied micro-zone for O2 and O3 respectively. Similar to horizontal thermal gradients, A2 cases are observed to have maximum vertical temperature difference compared to all airflow strategies. Despite this, only for case D2O3 does this temperature variation leads to thermal discomfort. For all other cases the difference in temperature between head and knee falls within the comfortable limits. In D2O3, even A3b leads to a temperature difference of 3 °C between head and knee of a seated occupant. From the analysis of transient PMV, PMV contours, PD due to draft and thermal gradients in the occupied micro-zone, it is clear that setback conditions help in reducing the time taken to achieve comfort, helps maintain PMV within ± 0.5, reduces draft and thermal gradients compared to conditioning only the occupied micro-zone. At the same time, it is understood that improperly planned setback-control leads to thermal discomfort. Thermal discomfort is observed even in full-zone conditioning and indicates that the air distributions need to be improved. Setback flow in all unoccupied micro-zones (A3b) leads to unwanted merging of air jets, leading to over-cooling at certain regions in the micro-zone and increases draft and thermal gradients. Thus, the assertion made at the beginning of the study on the need to tune the supply velocities of setback flow and setpoint temperatures of setback temperature and select the micro-zones in which setback conditions are to be maintained is found to be valid. 4.2 Effect of setback flow and setback temperature on thermal comfort As discussed, the effect of 3 different supply velocities for setback flow and 3 set-point temperatures for setback temperatures are analysed and the results of PMV analysis are plotted in Fig. 8 . For typical diffuser arrangement (D1) with 50 % occupancy (O2), the velocity of setback-flow is found to have only marginal effects. The PMV pattern is observed to have similar trends for all velocities. It was discussed in the previous section that airflow A3a was not able to achieve PMV within comfort limits for D1O3. However, Fig. 8 shows that increasing the velocity of setback flow to 0.3 m/s (A3a3) from 0.25 m/s (A3a2) helps in achieving comfort quickly. Even decreasing the airflow to 0.1 m/s (A3a1) reduces the time taken to attain PMV = 0. This is because, for an airflow of 0.25 m/s, cool air is deflected away from the occupied region, while it is not for 0.3 m/s and 0.1 m/s. Thus, it is observed that there exists an optimal setback flow for a given case and increasing the velocity beyond this optimal flow also increases the cooling time. The influence of setback flow velocity on air distribution is discussed here by taking the example of D2A3bO3. The transient thermal contours for D2A3b1O3 and D23b2O3 are shown in Fig. 9 . For D2A3bO3, using a low supply velocity in setback flow (3b1) leads to the merging of setback flow to the main flow and increases the spread of the cool air-jets in the occupied micro-zone. But when the supply velocity of setback flow is increased, it is seen that the setback flow spreads and gets attached to an adjacent wall. This pulls the cool air from occupied micro-zone to the unoccupied region, leading to increased thermal contours. In cases when wall is not near the diffuser, cool air spreads and moves to the occupied region. In the case of D2A3b3O3, on trying to cool the occupied region, the space is over-cooled with air-temperature in both occupied and unoccupied regions dropping to 20 °C. Using setback temperature in unoccupied micro-zones also show similar patterns as setback flow. For D1O2, decreasing the setback temperature to 25 °C (A4b1) from 26 °C (A4b2) reduces the time taken to reach PMV = 0 within occupied micro-zone. Reduced setback temperature reduces the temperature difference between the occupied and unoccupied region and thereby reduces the loss of cool air to adjacent unoccupied regions. It is surprising to observe in Fig. 8 that in few cases, increasing the setback temperature to 28 °C (A4b3) also reduces the time taken to attain PMV = 0. These are observed in cases D1A4O2, D1A4O3 and D2A4O2. This may be because of the aforementioned excessive merging of air jets. While cooling to a lower setback temperature, all diffusers are simultaneously operated at a high supply velocity for a longer time. If the distance between diffusers are less than the spread of air jets from diffusers, air jets will merge [4] and increased duration of operation increases the merging and deflection. A high setback temperature can be achieved before cool air jets start to merge, and switching off the diffusers in the unoccupied micro-zones on attaining the setback temperature reduces the unwanted deflection of air jets. Thus, similar to setback flow, optimal setback temperatures also exist for each case of diffuser arrangement and occupancy. Case D3A4O3 is taken as an example to show how setback temperature influences air distribution and is shown in Fig. 10 . It is seen that the cooling pattern is the same for both A4a1 and A4a3 until the required setback temperature is achieved. For A4a3, setback temperature is 28 °C and is achieved after 2 mins of cooling and from then, only the occupied micro-zone is cooled. Though this initially creates a comfortable region around occupants, after a few minutes of air-conditioning, cool air starts to get attracted by the adjacent wall and this leads to a higher temperature near the head and lower temperature near the feet of one occupant, thus leading to discomfort due to vertical thermal gradients. However, on cooling for some more time, as cool air graces the walls and moves to the unoccupied regions, the temperature difference between occupied and unoccupied regions reduce and hence cool air detaches from the wall to cater to the region around the occupants. On the other hand, when a setback temperature of 25 °C (A4a1) is used, the airflow in the diffusers in the unoccupied micro-zones are stopped after 4 mins. As the temperature difference between occupied and unoccupied micro-zones are less, cool air spreads adequately without attaching to the walls. And thus, the diffuser in the occupied micro-zone can be switched to the lower power maintenance cooling mode after about 7 mins of air-conditioning. This switch from high power to low power mode is needed not to only to save energy, but to also avoid over-cooling. Draft discomfort is also influenced by variations in supply velocities of setback flow and setpoint temperatures in setback temperature. Fig. 11 shows the transient variations in draft discomfort for different setback conditions. For D1A3O3, PD is less than 20 % while using a setback flow of 0.1 m/s (A3a1), but increases to 50 % when the velocity of setback flow increases (A3a2 and A3a3). Similarly, for D1A4O2, a setback temperature of 26 °C is observed to have lower PD than a setback temperature of 25 °C or 28 °C. But, when the diffuser arrangement changes, the optimal setback conditions also change. For D2A3O2, using a low setback temperature of 0.1 m/s increases PD to above 50 %, while a high velocity of 0.3 m/s reduces PD to less than 20 %. Similarly, for D3A3O3, using a setback flow of 0.25 m/s in all unoccupied micro-zones leads to a high PD, whereas all other setback velocities lead to a low PD. Fig. 12 shows the horizontal thermal gradients for different setback velocities and setback temperatures. The temperature difference within the occupied region is more than 3 °C for cases D1A3a1O2, D1A3a2O2, D1A3b1O2, D1A3b2O2, D1A3b3O2, D1A4b3O2, D1A3b1O3, D1A3b3O3, D1A4a1O3, D1A4a2O3, D2A3a2O2, D2A3a3O2, D2A3b1O2, D2A3b2O2, D2A3b3O2, D2A4a3O2, D2A4b2O3, D2A3a1O3, D2A4a3O3, D3A1O1, D3A3a1O2 and D3A2O3. Even when difference in temperature is within the expected limits, the overall temperature at certain micro-zones is very low, which indicates over-cooling. For instance, in D3A3O3, thermal gradients are within the limits, but airflow cases such as A3b3, A3b2 and A3a3 yield very low air temperature. This is reflected in low PMV values estimated for these cases. Vertical thermal asymmetry is violated only by a few cases, i.e.,D2A3a2O3, D3A3a2O3, D3A3b2O3. Fig. 13 gives the vertical temperature gradients for different setback velocities and setback temperatures. From the analysis of PMV, PD due to draft and thermal gradients in occupied micro-zones using different setback velocities and setback temperatures, it is observed that there exists optimal setback velocities and setback temperatures for a given layout and occupancy condition. The airflow control strategy to be used is influenced by several factors such as diffuser arrangement, location of micro-zone, occupancy, furniture type and partition etc., influence the air distribution and hence it is difficult to decide on the best airflow control strategy without exploring different strategies. Thus, an iterative search of different setback flows and setback temperatures aimed at optimising the energy savings will be beneficial. It is also understood that compliance to PMV, PD and thermal gradient standards are important. Hence, a suitable method to select the best airflow strategy for a given scenario will be to optimize energy consumption such that the optimised strategy does not violate the thermal comfort standards of PMV, PD and thermal gradients. The optimisation can be defined as given in Fig. 14 . 4.3 Energy consumption The energy consumed for MZOCC is calculated by adding the energy required to reach comfortable conditions (i.e., PMV = 0) and energy required to maintain comfortable conditions as discussed in section 3.2.2. The return air temperature is taken from CFD simulation while calculating the cooling and maintenance power. A higher return air temperature increases the energy consumption and a low return air temperature requires more volumetric airflow which can also increase energy. Hence a balance is to be maintained. The total energy consumed for each scenario for given occupancy conditions are given in Fig. 15 . The details of the energy calculations are given in Annexure A1. It is seen that all MZOCC strategies have lower energy consumption compared to typical full zone air-conditioning. Further, the maximum and minimum energy consumption is while using D3 \u2013 arrangement with more diffusers. This shows how airflow strategies in MZOCC improves energy performance. For D2A3b3O3, the energy consumed under MZOCC is almost similar to full zone conditioning. But changing the airflow strategy reduces energy consumption. As discussed, thermal comfort is not met in several simulation cases. Hence, following the method discussed in Fig. 14, thermal comfort compliance in terms of PMV votes around the occupants at breathing level and sectional planes, PD around occupants, horizontal and vertical thermal gradients are evaluated and the cases not complying all the comfort criteria are filtered out. The details of comfort compliance for all cases are given in Annexure A1. The percentage of energy saved with respect to full zone air-conditioning of each diffuser layout for the cases where thermal comfort is met are estimated and arranged in descending order is given in Fig. 16 . It is observed that, as the diffuser arrangement is improved from D1 to D3, the percentage of energy savings is also improved for both O2 and O3. Further, the number of airflow strategies that can be used for MZOCC without violating thermal comfort also increases. As observed, D2 has the least number of suitable airflow strategies, while D3 has the maximum. It is also seen that the best strategy for each diffuser arrangement and occupancy condition varies. For O2 (50 % occupancy cases) about 35 % to 60 % energy can be saved and for O3 (25 % occupancy cases), about 55 % to 85 % energy can be saved using comfort-based MZOCC. This saves 15 % more energy than using a set-point based control discussed in the earlier publication on MZOCC [4]. In few cases, such as D1A4a2O2, D1A4b3O3, D3A4a3O3 etc., using comfort-based MZOCC increases energy consumption as thermal comfort is not achieved even on reaching the set-point. This is because set-point temperatures are measured using thermostats placed at a fixed location in the micro-zone. Hence, in the aforementioned cases, though the temperature near the thermostat reached the required temperature, the required combination of air temperature, velocity and humidity was not achieved, which led to unsatisfactory PMV values in the occupied zone. This was mainly because of the high setback temperature maintained in the adjacent unoccupied micro-zones, that led to attachment of cool air to adjacent wall and increased thermal exchanges between the occupied and unoccupied micro-zones which created heavy thermal gradients in the occupied micro-zone. The adjacent unoccupied micro-zones were cooled through inter-micro-zonal interaction by the airflow in the occupied micro-zones before attaining comfortable conditions in the occupied micro-zone, which eventually increased the energy consumption. The need for additional air-conditioning to avoid thermal gradients in case of D3A4a3O3 was discussed in Fig. 10. For the aforementioned cases, decreasing the temperature set as setback temperature was found to reduce thermal gradients and energy consumption. This was because lower set-back temperature reduced the temperature difference between micro-zones and reduced the loss of cool air from occupied to unoccupied micro-zone. Thus, in comfort based MZOCC, cooling needs to be provided until all comfort criteria are met. Though this improves thermal comfort and reduces energy consumption compared to zonal level air-conditioning systems, the energy consumed may be a bit higher compared to setpoint based MZOCC in certain cases. Using appropriate airflow control strategy helps in reducing energy consumption without violating thermal comfort. 5 Discussion On evaluating thermal comfort and discomfort for different scenarios of diffuser arrangement, airflow control and occupancy, the research questions raised in the beginning of the study can be answered as follows: (1) Thermal comfort is not attained in all scenarios and there is a need to tune diffuser arrangement and airflow control to achieve thermal comfort. Hence just employing occupant centric-control (OCC) of diffusers in open-plan offices cannot ensure thermal comfort of occupants. Few common discomforts observed are − low PMV values that rises out of over-cooling due to concentration of cool air near walls, furniture and regions around diffusers, and draft discomfort due to excessive merging of air-jets. Horizontal thermal gradients are also common. Vertical thermal gradients are not common, but are observed in few cases. (2) For the studied medium sized office, tuned setback flow or tuned setback temperature are found effective in restoring thermal comfort. Optimal setback flows and setback temperatures need to be estimated separately for each scenario as they are influenced by a variety of factors. Spatial layout of the zone, size of the micro-zone, location of occupied micro-zone, presence of walls or partitions, duration of occupancy etc. are few parameters observed to influence optimal setback conditions. (3) The results of this study clearly show that comfort-based MZOCC is more efficient than a setpoint based MZOCC. This is because, by using appropriate airflow control strategy, thermal comfort can be achieved even without attaining set-point conditions. For the studied medium sized office, compared to typical full-zone air-conditioning, about 60 % energy can be saved when only half of the space is occupied and about 85 % energy can be saved when only quarter portion of the zone is occupied. This is about 15 % more than the total energy savings using set-point based control. It is also inferred that micro-zoning and airflow control strategy used are two critical aspects that can be tuned to improve MZOCC. Micro-zoning is the process of dividing a given thermal zone into micro-zones and allocating diffusers within each micro-zone. It is observed in this study that as micro-zoning improves, energy savings also increases. Further, it gives more flexibility on the airflow control strategy to be used. The factors that influence micro-zoning broadly includes the functional planning of the zone, furniture used, activities performed in the space, diffusers used etc. Detailed analysis of spatial planning of different open-plan offices will help in identifying the parameters to be considered while planning micro-zones and in developing protocols for micro-zoning. On using typical diffuser arrangements where micro-zoning is not optimised, airflow control plays the key role in improving MZOCC. Hence, only selected airflow control strategies are suitable to achieve thermal comfort and this restricts the efficiency of MZOCC. Once micro-zones are planned, airflow strategies can be planned using the method given in Fig. 14. This helps in selecting airflow strategies with minimum energy consumption that satisfies the comfort criteria following PMV votes, draft, horizontal and vertical thermal gradients. This framework can be used in future studies to explore best airflow control strategies for different office rooms. Thus, by analysing different office spaces with different occupancy scenarios, protocols for airflow control can also be formulated in the future. This will help in further shortlisting the different airflow control strategies to be included in the optimisation framework. 6 Conclusion and future directives This study analyzes thermal comfort under MZOCC and explores the energy saved by using a comfort-based MZOCC rather than typical set-point based control. In continuation to previous studies that explored the potential of MZOCC, this study explores how MZOCC can be strategized to achieve maximum energy savings without compromising thermal comfort. Reduced PMV votes that indicates over-cooling, draft discomfort rising out of unwanted merging of air-jets from adjacent diffusers and horizontal and vertical thermal gradients due to deflection of air-jets, attachment of air jets to walls or partitions etc., leads to thermal discomfort within occupied micro-zones. This study comprehensively evaluates these discomforts for different scenarios of diffuser arrangement, airflow cases and occupancy conditions. On observing that airflow control strategies such as setback flow and setback temperature improves thermal comfort, the effect of variations in setback flow and setback temperature on indoor air distribution, thermal comfort and energy consumption are evaluated. Results show that tuning the supply velocities of setback flow and setpoint temperatures of setback temperature after improving the micro-zonal layout improves thermal comfort. The energy consumed by using comfort-based MZOCC is estimated considering the time taken to reach PMV = 0 and the return air temperature on reaching PMV = 0. From all the airflow control strategies analysed for each diffuser arrangement, the scenarios in which thermal comfort criteria are met are selected and the energy saved using comfort-based MZOCC is compared against typical zonal level comfort-based control. Results show that energy savings increases with improvement in diffuser arrangement. At the same time, different airflow control strategies are found to perform differently for different diffuser arrangement and the best control strategy differs for each of the cases. Hence a systematic method in which diffusers are first planned and then the best airflow control is selected must be devised. This study gives a methodological framework for selecting airflow control strategy. But the method can be further improved by analysing the space and selecting strategies that fits the functional planning of the zone. This requires detailed analysis of the spatial planning of open-plan office, usage pattern, activity type and schedule, furniture used and analysis of air distribution under MZOCC for these varying spatial settings. As performing experiments in different office settings is not feasible, validated digital twins of office spaces can be used to analyse the indoor conditions. Such in-depth analysis will help in developing protocols for planning airflow and will help in shortlisting strategies that are used as input to the optimisation framework discussed in this study. One limitation of this study is that, though humidity was considered while evaluating thermal comfort, the variations in humidity due to occupancy is not taken into consideration. This was because the experiments performed to validate the CFD model was done in an unoccupied room. Occupants alter humidity patterns in a room by sweating and breathing. In another publication of the authors, a simulation model has been developed where humidity due to occupancy is also considered [26]. This validated model and the optimisation framework suggested in this study can be used in future studies to develop protocols for micro-zoning and airflow control. Further, the study assumed that airflow is controlled through each diffuser using automatic volume control dampers and the required velocity and temperature at the diffuser boundary was manually altered in the CFD model to explore different strategies. Though fan power at the AHU was considered while estimating energy consumption with respect to the supply air velocity at each diffuser, AHU with fan was not modelled in CFD. Future studies can explore methods of modelling AHU and developing a smart control system for modulating airflow through the AHU in tune with the required velocity at the diffusers. This study uses CFD simulations to develop a method of strategizing MZOCC to ensure thermal comfort at minimum energy consumption. Future studies can explore methods of implementing MZOCC. This has to be done in two stages, where the static parameters such as micro-zonal layout, diffuser arrangement and furniture arrangement are optimised in the first stage. In the second stage, airflow through diffusers is to be controlled considering transient changes in occupancy pattern and thermal preferences. The first stage requires detailed analysis of the activities in the zone, usage of spaces etc. The second level requires control systems that can dynamically alter airflow control. This requires a real-time sensing mechanism which is capable of communicating to a server that optimises the airflow strategy so that minimum energy is consumed without violating thermal comfort and communicates the required airflow to automatic volume control dampers attached to each diffuser. Advanced zone level OCC systems discussed in recent studies [27] can be improved to operate at a micro-zonal level by incorporating the aforementioned bi-level optimisation framework. Further, personal comfort models can predict the inter-personal and intra-personal variations in thermal preferences [28] and can be used in comfort based MZOCC to further improve the efficiency.

        "dc:description": "The potential of Micro-Zonal Occupant Centric Control (MZOCC) to save HVAC energy consumption in medium sized open-plan offices has been established in literature. This is done by virtually dividing a thermal zone into micro-zones and allowing independent diffuser-level control in each micro-zone when the micro-zone is occupied. In continuation, there is a need to ensure that thermal comfort is achieved within micro-zones under such localised control. This is important because several forms of discomfort such as draft, horizontal thermal asymmetry and vertical thermal gradients may arise in MZOCC. Further, the effect of MZOCC airflow control strategies, such as setback flow and setback temperature, which were proposed in previous studies on thermal comfort of occupants needs to be evaluated. In an attempt to address these research gaps, this study explores thermal comfort for different scenarios of diffuser arrangements, airflow control strategies and occupancy conditions and also explores the effect of varying supply velocities used in setback flow and setpoint temperatures used as setback temperatures on air distribution and thermal comfort. Results show that low PMV values, increased draft discomfort and heavy thermal gradients are observed for certain scenarios of MZOCC. Tuning airflow control by choosing appropriate setback flow or setback temperature helps in restoring thermal comfort. As different forms of discomfort are observed in different cases, it is important to plan micro-zones and control airflow, such that, MZOCC does not violate thermal comfort criteria while optimising energy efficiency. This study gives a framework for selecting appropriate airflow control strategies for a selected diffuser arrangement for a given occupancy condition. Comfort-based MZOCC that uses appropriate airflow control strategy saves about 60% energy when the zone is half occupied and about 85% energy when the zone is quarter occupied. Results also show that, improving the diffuser arrangement improves energy savings and increases the options of airflow control strategies that can be used. Also, different airflow control strategies behave differently for each diffuser arrangement and has to be chosen separately for given diffuser setting and occupancy condition.",
