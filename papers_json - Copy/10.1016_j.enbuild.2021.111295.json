In this study, a refrigerant evaporating temperature control algorithm was developed for the variable refrigerant flow (VRF) system, and its effect was quantitatively examined through a multi-calorimeter experiment and a field test in actual buildings. As previous studies on refrigerant evaporating temperature control have been predominantly conducted through experiments and simulation, aspects such as the impact of refrigerant evaporating temperature control on energy-saving and indoor temperature in an actual building and the change in the energy efficiency of the VRF system due to the Thermo on\u2013off change of indoor units, have not been examined. As such, in this study, an algorithm that predicts the indoor load based on the indoor temperature change and controls the refrigerant evaporating temperature based on the load was developed. Before applying the developed algorithm to actual buildings, the effectiveness of refrigerant evaporating temperature control was evaluated through an experiment. Changes in the performance and efficiency of the VRF system according to the evaporating temperature and the number of operating indoor units were measured in a multi-calorimeter, and the effect of refrigerant evaporating temperature control on the reduction in the actual number of operating indoor units due to the Thermo off was examined under part-load conditions. In addition, the developed algorithm was applied to the office and education buildings in a factory located in Thai Nguyen city, Vietnam, and its energy-saving effect on the indoor temperatures was verified as per the energy effect verification process provided by the International performance measurement and verification protocol (IPMVP). The verification results confirmed that conducting refrigerant evaporating temperature control saves energy by increasing the Thermo on rate and the refrigerant evaporating temperature. It was additionally confirmed through the actual operation data that refrigerant evaporating temperature control has the effect of improving the indoor thermal environment by increasing the accuracy of indoor temperature control.

The world\u2019s primary energy consumption increased by 50.3% from 100,776 TWh in 2000 to 151,448 TWh in 2019, and it has been increasing by 0.73\u2013 4.86% compared to the previous year except for 2009 [1,2]. International Energy Outlook 2019 (IEO 2019) Reference case, which is a U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) Project, predicted that this trend will cause the primary energy consumption to increase by approximately 50% in 2050 compared to 2018. It also expects that a sharp increase in energy consumption will occur not in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries but in the non-OECD countries, and especially in Asian countries [3]. Regarding the energy consumption by sector, the industrial sector represents the largest proportion (approximately 45%) in 2018, followed by the building sector that combines both household and industrial energy consumptions (29%), and the transportation sector (21%). Considering that it is difficult to improve energy efficiency and save energy in the industrial sector, energy-saving measures for the building sector, especially for the heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems that represents half the energy consumption in a building, are required. In this regard, in the field of HVAC facilities, the variable refrigerant flow (VRF) system, which has higher efficiency compared to the conventional HVAC system, has attracted attention. The VRF system has mainly grown in Asia and continues to grow worldwide. It exhibited a high growth rate from 2013 to 2018 as its compound annual growth rate (CAGR) was 11%, and is expected to grow at a high CAGR of 12.7% from 2020 to 2025 [4,5]. With the expansion of the VRF system in the market, related studies have additionally been actively conducted. To verify the energy efficiency of the VRF system, studies on simulation model development and energy consumption prediction for VRF systems and their energy-saving potential compared to the conventional HVAC system have been conducted. Furthermore, research was conducted on advanced control strategies for more efficient operation. Simulation models for the VRF system have been developed and implemented in several building energy simulation programs, including eQUEST, EnergyPlus, Trace 700, and IES-VE. The existing models can predict the energy performance of the entire system by inputting the system-level performance curves provided by the maker [6]. Subsequently, Tianzhen Hong et al. and Rongpeng Zhang et al. developed a new physics-based model, and examined accuracy improvement and advanced controls, such as refrigerant evaporating temperature and condensation temperature controls, under part-load conditions. Another key feature of the model is the introduction of component level curves for indoor units and outdoor units instead of system-level performance curves [6,7]. Models for direct expansion air handling unit-water source VRF heat pump system and VRF system with a dedicated outdoor air system were developed by expanding these models, and the model accuracy was improved by performing correction using actual operation data. Consequently, the models exhibited high accuracy with CV (RMSE) values of 14.5% and 15.7%, respectively [8,9]. Recently, data mining methods have additionally been used in predicting the energy consumption of the VRF system. Deyin Zhao et al. predicted the energy consumption of the VRF system using artificial neural network (ANN), support vector regression (SVM), and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models, which are data mining methods, and observed that the ANN model most accurately reproduced the energy performance of the VRF system [10]. Min Hee Chung et al. and Bo Rang Park et al. constructed models for predicting the energy consumptions of cooling and heating operations using the ANN model, and performed model optimization for accuracy improvement and stable prediction. The Cv (RMSE) values of the cooling and heating models were found to be 11.28% and 4.87%, respectively, showing that the data mining method additionally has high accuracy in predicting the energy consumption of the VRF system [11,12]. The energy-saving potential of the VRF system compared to the conventional HVAC system has been examined using energy consumption prediction models [13\u201315] Dongsu Kim et al. compared the energy consumption of the Roof Top Unit(RTU) \u2013 Variable Air Volume(VAV) system, which has been widely used in the United States, with that of the VRF system using the medium office prototype building model developed by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). For various performance evaluations, they selected and compared 16 cities that represent all the climate zones of the United States. The simulation results showed that the VRF system can save energy by 15% to 42% per year [15]. The examination of the energy-saving potential by simulation thus far, however, assumed that all indoor units operated during a certain period. In actual buildings, the number of indoor units varies because they are turned on and off by the user [16]. Moreover, the Thermo off operation in which the supply of refrigerant to indoor units is stopped and only indoor fans are operated occurs for indoor units in operation once the indoor temperature has reached the set temperature, thereby constantly changing the number of operating indoor units in the refrigeration cycle. The change in the number of operating indoor units by the user and indoor unit control specifications and the subsequent change in the performance of the VRF system have not been reflected in previous simulations. Je Hyeon Lee et al. verified the energy-saving effect in consideration of the change in the number of operating indoor units through a field test based on the operation data measured by varying the number of operating indoor units in an occupancy-emulated research building where both the RTU-VAV system and VRF system were installed [17]. For operational advanced control strategies for more efficient use of the VRF system, studies on the control of the refrigerant evaporating temperature and the optimal control of the coolant temperature and flow rate for the water-cooled VRF system were conducted [18]\u2013[21]. Deyin Zhao et al. examined the effect of the refrigerant evaporating temperature control under the same load condition through a multi-calorimeter experiment, and observed that the effect significantly increased at a part-load factor of 50% or less [18]. Geun Young Yun et al. calculated the annual energy-saving effect through refrigerant evaporating temperature control by performing simulation based on the multi-calorimeter experiment results, and observed that the energy-saving effect increased during periods with small loads and that energy could be saved by approximately 14% per year [19]. Insung Kang et al. and Jin Woo Moon et al. developed a model for predicting the energy consumption and operational cost of the water-cooled VRF system according to the coolant temperature and flow rate using the ANN model, and additionally developed a control set value calculation algorithm that minimizes energy consumption and operational cost. When they examined the effect through the simulation corrected using actual operation data, an energy-saving effect of 28.44% for cooling operation and an operational cost saving effect of 7.93% for the heating operation were observed [20,21]. In this study, the effect of refrigerant evaporating temperature control, one of the advanced control strategies, was examined through an experiment and its application to actual buildings. Previous studies on refrigerant evaporating temperature control were conducted through experiments and simulation, but they did not consider the performance of the VRF system according to the number of operating indoor units as aforementioned. As such, in this study, an algorithm that predicts the indoor load based on the indoor temperature change, and controls the refrigerant evaporating temperature based on the load was developed. For the developed algorithm, changes in the performance and efficiency of the VRF system according to the evaporating temperature and the number of operating indoor units were measured in a multi-calorimeter, and the effect of refrigerant evaporating temperature control with respect to the change in the number of operating indoor units due to the Thermo off was examined under part-load conditions. In addition, the developed algorithm was applied to the office and education buildings in a factory located in Thai Nguyen city, Vietnam, to verify its effect in actual buildings. Moreover, the energy-saving effect of refrigerant evaporating temperature control was verified through the energy effect verification process provided by the International performance measurement and verification protocol (IPMVP), and changes in indoor unit Thermo on\u2013off and indoor temperature control accuracy due to the refrigerant evaporating temperature control were clarified. 2 Development of a refrigerant evaporating temperature control algorithm A control algorithm that predicts the indoor load based on the changes in the indoor temperature and the refrigerant evaporating temperature in real-time was developed. Fig. 1 shows the flow chart of the developed algorithm. As the central air-conditioning system supplies the heat required indoors using water and air as media, it is possible to calculate an accurate performance by measuring the temperatures, humidities, and flow rates of the media. For the VRF system that uses a refrigerant as a medium, however, the flow rate cannot be accurately measured because the refrigerant exists both in liquid and gaseous phases, making it impossible to accurately calculate the performance of the system installed at an actual site. Therefore, in this study, the indoor load was predicted by calculating the required capacity (Q_req) of each indoor unit through the indoor temperature trend, and the difference between the indoor temperature and set temperature. The indoor temperature trend was identified by calculating the difference (dT1) between the current indoor temperature (Tindoor_t) and the previous indoor temperature (Tindoor_t-1) for the indoor unit in operation. The difference (dT2) between the indoor temperature (Tindoor_t) and set temperature (Tset) was then calculated. When the indoor temperature tended to decrease with a negative dT1 value, the required capacity of the indoor unit was set to 100% of the rated capacity for a dT2 value of 3 K or more, 66% for 2 to 3 K, 33% for 1 to 2 K, and 0% for less than 1 K. On the contrary, when the indoor temperature tended to increase with a positive dT1 value, the required capacity of the indoor unit was set to 100% of the rated capacity for a dT2 value of 2 K or more, 66% for 1 to 2 K, 33% for 0 to 1 K, and 0% for less than 0 K (Fig. 2 ). The required capacity was calculated for all the indoor units operated, and the value obtained by dividing the sum of these values by the sum of the rated capacities of all the indoor units operated was used as the part load ratio (Eq. (1)). (1) Q PLR = ∑ i = 1 n Q _ r e q i / ∑ i = 1 n Q _ r a t e d i where, Q PLR is the part load ratio (−), Q _ r e q is the relative required capacity (kW), Q _ r a t e d is the rated capacity (kW), and n is the number of the indoor units operated. The part load ratio was calculated every minute. Based on the 30-min average of the part load ratio, the refrigerant evaporating temperature was selected once every 30 min and set to the VRF system. The control interval of 30 min was determined considering the time required for a change in the set value of the refrigerant evaporating temperature to be finally reflected to the control of the actual device. The refrigerant evaporating temperature was set to 8 °C for a part-load factor of 0.8 or higher, 10 °C for 0.6 to 0.7, and 12 °C for 0.5 or less. The 0.7\u20130.8 and 0.5\u20130.6 sections were set as hysteresis sections to prevent the refrigerant evaporating temperature from increasing or decreasing repeatedly (Fig. 3 ). 3 Examination of the effect of refrigerant evaporating temperature control through an experiment 3.1 Experimental method To quantitatively evaluate the energy-saving effect of refrigerant evaporating temperature control, the cooling performance and efficiency according to the refrigerant evaporating temperature were measured using a multi-calorimeter. In addition, the effectiveness of refrigerant evaporating temperature control was examined by comparing the system efficiency that considered the change in the number of operating indoor units due to the Thermo off and the system efficiency owing to the control of the refrigerant evaporating temperature under part-load conditions. Fig. 4 shows the multi-calorimeter configuration used in the experiment and the installation status of the VRF system. Fig. 5 shows the pipe connection status between the indoor and outdoor units of the VRF system. Tables 1 and 2 show the specifications of the multi-calorimeter and VRF system. The multi-calorimeter consists of an outdoor chamber that reproduces the outdoor environment and an indoor chamber that reproduces the indoor environment. One outdoor unit was installed in the outdoor chamber and four duct-type indoor units in the indoor chamber, and all the indoor units were connected to the code tester (Fig. 4). For the outdoor chamber, the controllable cooling capacity ranged from 14.5 to 145.3 kW, the air temperature from − 30 to 60 °C, and the relative humidity from 5 to 90%. For the indoor chamber, the controllable cooling capacity ranged from 5.8 to 58.1 kW, the air temperature from 0 to 50 °C, and the relative humidity from 10 to 90%. Constant temperature and humidity control are possible for each chamber. The accuracy that represents the reliability of the measured data, which is the difference between the true value and the average of the measurements, and the error for repeatability, which is the degree of variability in the measurements by measuring instruments, are within ± 2% (Table 1). For the installed outdoor unit, the cooling capacity was 29.0 kW, and the integrated cooling power input was 8.0 kW. For the indoor units, the cooling capacity was 7.2 kW, and the power input was 130 W, and the airflow can be controlled by 1,020 m3/h, 900 m3/h, 700 m3/h (Table 2). The VRF system had a total pipe length of 50 m as per the multi-air conditioner and heat pump performance test method of South Korea. The pipe length from the outdoor unit to the branch joint was 35 m and that from the branch joint to each indoor unit was 15 m (Fig. 5) [22]. The air temperature and humidity in each chamber, the air temperature and humidity at the inlet and outlet of each indoor unit, the air differential pressure inside the code tester, and the power consumptions of all devices were measured and monitored. The cooling capacity of the indoor units was calculated using the air enthalpy method by measuring the air temperature and humidity at the inlet and outlet, and the air differential pressure inside the code tester, whereas the cooling capacity of the outdoor unit was the sum of the cooling capacities of all indoor units. The EER of the VRF system was calculated by dividing the cooling capacity of outdoor unit by the sum of indoor and outdoor power consumption. Test cases are shown in Tables 3 and 4 . Table 3 shows cases for examining efficiency according to the refrigerant evaporating temperature. The refrigerant evaporating temperature was varied to 8, 10, and 12 °C for a dry-bulb (DB) temperature of 35 °C /wet-bulb (WB) temperature of 24 °C, and DB temperature of 27 °C / WB temperature of 19 °C as outside air conditions. For each condition, the system performance and power consumption were measured. In this instance, the indoor conditions were a DB temperature of 27 °C and a WB temperature of 19 °C, and the number of operating indoor units was four. Table 4 shows cases for examining system efficiency according to the number of operating indoor units under part-load conditions. While the refrigerant evaporating temperature was constant at 8 °C when the outside air conditions had DB and WB temperatures of 35 °C and 24 °C, respectively and the indoor conditions were DB and WB temperatures of 27 °C and 19 °C, respectively, the system performance and power consumption were measured when the number of operating indoor units decreased from four to one, in decrements of one. In all cases, indoor unit air flow was operated at 1,020 m3/h. As for the experimental sequence, the multi-calorimeter was operated first, and the internal temperature and humidity conditions of the outdoor and indoor chambers were set according to the indoor and outdoor conditions for each case. When the temperature and humidity conditions of the chambers became constant, the indoor and outdoor units of the VRF system were operated. When the outdoor unit of the VRF system maintained constant cooling capacity, the system was judged to reach a steady state. Operation data for 30 min were then obtained, and average values were used for analysis. 3.2 Experimental results Table 5 shows the indoor unit operation results and Fig. 6 the efficiency of the VRF system according to the refrigerant evaporating temperature. As shown in Table 5, the air temperature at the indoor unit outlet increased as the refrigerant evaporating temperature increased. Based on the evaporating temperature of 8 °C, the air temperature increased by 0.5 °C (average of cases 2 and 5) at 10 °C and by 2.4 °C (average of cases 3 and 6) at 12 °C. In addition, the absolute humidity of the outlet air also increased as the evaporating temperature increased, thereby reducing the dehumidification amount of the indoor units. Based on the evaporating temperature of 8 °C, the amounts of sensible heat treated by the indoor units due to the change in evaporating temperature were 97.6 and 95.8% at 10 °C and 82.1 and 87.1% at 12 °C when the outside air temperatures were 35 and 27 °C, respectively. Based on the evaporating temperature of 8 °C, the amounts of latent heat were 86.9 and 86.0% at 10 °C and 23.3 and 53.7% at 12 °C when the outside air temperatures were 35 and 27 °C, respectively. The amount of latent heat was more reduced than the amount of sensible heat. In particular, the amount of latent heat was significantly reduced in case 3 with an evaporating temperature of 12 °C and an outside air temperature of 35 °C. The efficiency results according to the refrigerant evaporating temperature were expressed based on the energy efficiency ratio (EER) of case 1, which had a refrigerant evaporating temperature of 8 °C and an outdoor air DB temperature of 35 °C. As the refrigerant evaporating temperature increased, EER showed a tendency to increase. The improvement rate was observed to be similar regardless of the outdoor air conditions. Compared to the EER rates at a refrigerant evaporating temperature of 8 °C, the EER rates at 10 °C were observed to be improved by 8.4 and 9.7% when the outside air temperatures were 35 and 27 °C, respectively, and those at 12 °C were improved by 24.4 and 26.0%, respectively. Fig. 7 shows the experiment results on efficiency according to the number of operating indoor units, and the efficiency results according to the refrigerant evaporating temperature. The results were expressed based on the EER of case 1. In the graph, the difference in system efficiency depending on the part-load response control method can be seen. The VRF system supplies the refrigerant to the indoor units through expansion values to control the indoor temperature to the set temperature. If the indoor temperature reaches the set temperature, the expansion valves are closed to stop the supply of the refrigerant to the indoor units and only the indoor unit fans are operated. In other words, the number of indoor units that operate decreases under part-load conditions. Regarding the EER rate according to the number of operating indoor units, EER decreased along with the reduction in cooling capacity as the number of operating indoor units decreased. Based on the EER rate of four operating indoor units, the EER rate decreased by approximately 2% for three operating indoor units, 6% for two, and 20% for one. In particular, the EER rate significantly decreased when the number of operating indoor units decreased from two to one. NISHIZAWA et al. compared the power consumption between when the 50% load processed by the outdoor unit was handled by one indoor unit and when it was handled by two indoor units, by 25% for a system in which one outdoor unit was connected to two indoor units. It was observed that the power consumption decreased by approximately 27% when the load was shared by the two indoor units. The study indicated that the efficiency may differ depending on the number of operating indoor units despite the same amount of heat being processed [23]. Refrigerant evaporating temperature control can reduce cooling capacity while maintaining the number of operating indoor units, thereby making it possible to secure more operating indoor units than the conventional operation method for the same part-load. Therefore, it is expected to improve efficiency, by increasing the refrigerant evaporating temperature, and to prevent the system efficiency degradation due to the reduction in the number of operating indoor units. 4 Verification of the algorithm effect through application to actual buildings 4.1 Field test method The developed algorithm for refrigerant evaporating temperature control was applied to actual buildings, and the energy-saving effect of the algorithm was verified by comparing the energy consumptions before and after the algorithm application. The target buildings were office and education buildings in the factory located in Thai Nguyen city. Thai Nguyen city, a city located in northeastern Vietnam, is approximately 80 km away to the north of Hanoi. It has a subtropical climate with the rainy season from May to September and the dry season from October to April. In the rainy season, the weather is hot with an average daily temperature of approximately 28 °C and an average maximum temperature of approximately 32 °C. In the dry season, the temperature differs by month and the coolest periods of the year are December, January, and February when the average daily temperature is approximately 17 °C and the average maximum temperature is approximately 20 °C. In addition, the relative humidity is approximately 80% throughout the year, indicating humid weather [24]. The target buildings were completed in 2013. The office and the education buildings are both three-storied with a building floor area of 13,365 m2 and 22,275 m2, respectively. Regarding the target VRF system, 55 outdoor units (34.8\u201363.8 kW) and 284 indoor units have been installed in the office building, and the total outdoor unit capacity is 2,407 kW. In the welfare building, 66 outdoor units (34.8\u201363.8 kW) and 331 indoor units have been installed, and the total outdoor unit capacity is 3,230.6 kWh. For both buildings, no air-conditioning system other than the VRF system was installed. The total control, including turning on/off the indoor units, setting the indoor temperature (18 °C ~ 30 °C) and the air flow mode (Auto, High, Mid, Low), is freely performed by the occupants through the wired remote control installed on the wall. Fig. 8 shows the verification schedule. Verification was performed during the work hours from 09:00 to 17:00 on weekdays in October 2020. For the VRF system, algorithm operation, which applied refrigerant evaporating temperature control according to the load, and baseline operation were performed. The baseline operation controlled the refrigerant evaporation temperature of 8 °C, which is the default set value of the VRF system used in the field test. During October, in Thai Nguyen city, there are significant changes in daily outdoor air temperature due to the transition from the rainy season to the dry season. Therefore, baseline operation was performed from October 1st to 15th, whereas algorithm and baseline operations were performed alternately every other day from 16th to reduce differences in boundary conditions, including outdoor air conditions. The measured indoor and outdoor unit operation data items are shown in Tables 6 and 7 . The operation data of 8 indoor unit items and 11 outdoor unit items were measured every minute for all the indoor and outdoor units. The power consumption was measured only for the outdoor units, and it was not considered for the indoor units in this study. The power consumptions of all outdoor units were measured every minute by installing four watt-hour meters in each building considering the power connection status of the outdoor units. 4.2 Field test results Owing to the nature of the verification performed for the VRF systems installed in actual buildings, it is not easy to accurately verify the effectiveness of the algorithm as there are differences in boundary conditions, such as outdoor air conditions before and after the algorithm application, the hours of use of the indoor units, and indoor temperature. In this study, the method provided by IPMVP, which has been widely used as an energy-saving effect calculation method, was adopted for more accurate verification of the effect. The IPMVP was published in 1996 and has gone through several revisions, translated into about 10 languages, and is now a standard in energy efficiency projects [25]. The IPMVP provides a procedure for comparing the energy consumption levels before and after the application of energy conservation measurements (ECM) [26]. The IPMVP energy-savings framework is depicted in Fig. 9 [27]. The energy consumption measurement during the baseline period (blue line) serves as the basis of energy consumption in any building with respect to its independent variables without any intervention of ECM. To accurately report savings, the baseline energy is adjusted to the same conditions of the independent variables in the post-implementation period. The difference between measured energy consumption during the post-ECM implementation period (green line) and the adjusted baseline energy consumption is the energy that has been saved [28]. In this study, a multiple linear regression (MLR) model was used to predict the adjusted baseline energy during the post-ECM implementation period [29,30]. The MLR model was derived using the operation data of the days when baseline operation was performed. The accuracy and goodness-of-fit of the derived model were evaluated through the coefficient of determination and F-statistic. R2, which is additionally referred to as the coefficient of determination, represents how well the regression model describes the data. It ranges from 0 to 1, and the accuracy is higher as it is closer to 1. F-statistic tests the statistical significance of a regression model. It is recalculated as a P value and has statistical significance when it is 0.05 or less. The independent variables of the MLR model are the average outdoor air temperature during the indoor unit operating duration, the daily cumulative operating duration of the indoor units, and the average set temperature of the indoor units. The dependent variables of the model are the daily cumulative power consumption of the outdoor units. Eq.2 shows the form of the model, and the regression coefficient calculation results are shown in Table 8 . (2) P OU = a T out + b O T IU + c T i n _ s e t + d where, POU is the daily cumulative power consumption of the outdoor units (kWh), Tout is the average outdoor air temperature (°C), OTIU is the daily cumulative operating duration of the indoor units (h), Tin_set is the indoor average set temperature (°C), and a, b, c, and d are regression coefficients (-). As for the calculation results of the regression coefficients, the regression coefficients of the outdoor average temperature and the daily cumulative operating duration of the indoor units, a and b, have positive values, while the regression coefficient of the indoor average set temperature, c, has a negative value. The phenomena in which the outdoor unit power consumption increases as the outdoor temperature and outdoor unit operating duration increase, and the outdoor unit power consumption decreases as the indoor temperature increases in cooling operation, were well reflected in the regression model. Both the office building and education building models exhibited an R2 value of 0.89, which was higher than 0.75 required by IPMVP. The P values of F-statistic were 0.00041 for the office building and 0.00040 for the education building. They are statistically significant because they are less than 0.05. The adjusted baseline energy of the corresponding day can be calculated by inputting the outdoor average temperature, the daily cumulative operating duration of the indoor units, and the indoor average set temperature of the algorithm operation day into the derived MLR model. By comparing the adjusted baseline energy with the measured outdoor unit power consumption of algorithm operation, the power consumptions of the two operations can be compared under the same boundary conditions. Fig. 10 shows the results of comparing the outdoor unit power consumption. The bar graph represents the measured power consumption and the dotted line graph the adjusted baseline energy calculated through the MLR model. The results show that the measured power consumption of algorithm operation was lower than the adjusted baseline energy for both the office and education buildings. This confirmed that the application of the algorithm reduced the outdoor unit power consumption. The average power consumption reduction rates were 13.5% for the office building and 16.8% for the education building. During the algorithm operation, the refrigerant evaporating temperature was set to 12 °C for 89.4% of the total outdoor unit operating duration in the office building and for 78.2% in the education building owing to the low load. The average refrigerant evaporating temperatures were 11.7 and 11.5 °C, respectively, which were approximately 3.5 °C higher than 8 °C of the baseline operation. To identify changes in the number of operating indoor units due to refrigerant evaporating temperature control, the ratio of the duration in which the refrigerant was supplied to the indoor units to the total operating duration of the indoor units, i.e. the Thermo on rate, was compared before and after the algorithm application. As the Thermo on rate may vary depending on the load change due to the change in indoor set temperature, the indoor set temperature was compared first for an accurate comparison (Fig. 11 ). For the comparison, only the data from October 16th to 29th were used. For the office building, there was slight difference in indoor set temperature between baseline and algorithm operations. Operation at the indoor set temperature ranging from 24 to 28 °C represented approximately 93% of the total operation in the same way before and after the algorithm application, and the operation at the indoor set temperature of 26 °C exhibited the higher proportion of approximately 53%. For the education building, contrastingly, the indoor set temperature was widely distributed from 18 to 30 °C due to the building use characteristics in which the VRF system operates intermittently and users change over time, and there were differences in set temperature between baseline and algorithm operations. Therefore, the Thermo on rate was compared only for the office building with slight difference in set temperature. As for the Thermo on rate according to the outdoor air temperature (Fig. 12 ), the rate showed a tendency to increase for both baseline and algorithm operations as the outdoor air temperature increased due to the increase in indoor load. In addition, the Thermo on rate of the algorithm operation was observed to be approximately 5\u201310% higher than that of baseline operation at all outdoor air temperatures due to refrigerant evaporating temperature control. It was confirmed through the operation data in the actual buildings that the reduction in the number of operating indoor units was inhibited through the refrigerant evaporating temperature under part-load conditions. Next, the impact of refrigerant evaporating temperature control on indoor temperature was examined. Here, a comparison was performed using the data from October 16th to 29th for the office building with similar indoor set temperatures. dT, which is the difference between the set temperature and the indoor temperature, was classified into − 1 > dT, −1 ≤ dT ≤ 1, and 1 < dT sections, and the proportion of the operating duration corresponding to each section in the total indoor unit operating duration was compared (Fig. 13 ). The − 1 > dT section decreased by approximately 4% from 21.3% in baseline operation to 17.5% in algorithm operation, whereas the −1 ≤ dT ≤ 1 section increased by approximately 4.5% from 69.4% in baseline operation to 73.9% in algorithm operation. The 1 < dT section decreased by approximately 0.6% from 9.2% in baseline operation to 8.6% in algorithm operation. These results confirmed that overcooling operation was inhibited, and the accuracy of indoor temperature control was improved by refrigerant evaporating temperature control. 5 Conclusions In this study, a control algorithm that changes the refrigerant evaporating temperature in real-time based on the indoor load was developed for a VRF system, and its effect was verified using the VRF system installed in a multi-calorimeter and actual buildings. The following are the key findings and lessons learned from this case study. 1. As the amount of heat processed by the VRF system cannot be accurately measured in actual buildings, the amount of heat processed by the indoor units was calculated through the indoor temperature trend and the difference between the indoor temperature and the set temperature. Based on this, a control algorithm that changes the refrigerant evaporating temperature every 30 min was developed. 2. An experiment was performed in a multi-calorimeter to evaluate the effectiveness of the energy-saving effect through refrigerant evaporating temperature control. The cooling performance and efficiency of the system according to the refrigerant evaporating temperature were measured, while the indoor and outdoor conditions and the number of operating indoor units remained constant. The experiment results showed that the dehumidification amount of the indoor units was significantly reduced when the refrigerant evaporating temperature was increased from 8 to 10 and 12 °C due to the increase in the air temperature at the indoor unit outlet. Compared to the evaporating temperature of 8 °C, the outdoor unit efficiency was improved by approximately 9 and 25% at 10 and 12 °C, respectively. This confirmed the efficiency improvement effect due to the increase in refrigerant evaporating temperature. In addition, the number of operating indoor units decreased previously under part-load conditions because the indoor temperature was controlled through Thermo on\u2013off, but refrigerant evaporating temperature control is expected to prevent the efficiency degradation due to the decrease in the number of operating indoor units because it can reduce the cooling capacity while maintaining the number of operating indoor units. 3. The effect of the developed refrigerant evaporating temperature control algorithm was verified by applying it to the VRF system installed in the office and education buildings located in Thai Nguyen city, Vietnam. The verification was performed for one month in October 2020, and the effect was verified as per the effect verification process provided by the IPMVP using the measured operation data. The adjusted baseline energy was calculated by inputting the boundary conditions of the days when algorithm operation was performed into the multiple linear regression (MLR) model derived based on the baseline operation data, and compared with the measured power consumption of the days when algorithm operation was performed to verify the effect. The results showed that the outdoor unit power consumption decreased by 13.5% for the office building and 16.8% for the education building. In addition, when the Thermo on rate was analyzed for the office building where the indoor set temperature remained constant, it was found that the Thermo on rate increased by approximately 5\u201310% during algorithm operation. It was verified through the measured data that refrigerant temperature control has the effect of inhibiting the reduction in the number of operating indoor units and the subsequent efficiency improvement effect. The impact of the developed algorithm on indoor temperature control was examined through the measured data. The overcooling section in which the difference between the set temperature and the indoor temperature (dT) attained − 1 > dT, decreased by approximately 4% from 21.3% in baseline operation to 17.5% in algorithm operation, whereas the − 1 ≤ dT ≤ 1 section increased by approximately 4.5% from 69.4% in baseline operation to 73.9% in algorithm operation. Through this, it was confirmed that overcooling operation was inhibited and the accuracy of indoor temperature control was improved. In this study, however, the effect of refrigerant evaporating temperature control on indoor humidity was not verified through a field test. Therefore, further research is required in the future.

As previous studies on refrigerant evaporating temperature control have been predominantly conducted through experiments and simulation, aspects such as the impact of refrigerant evaporating temperature control on energy-saving and indoor temperature in an actual building and the change in the energy efficiency of the VRF system due to the Thermo on\u2013off change of indoor units, have not been examined. As such, in this study, an algorithm that predicts the indoor load based on the indoor temperature change and controls the refrigerant evaporating temperature based on the load was developed. Before applying the developed algorithm to actual buildings, the effectiveness of refrigerant evaporating temperature control was evaluated through an experiment. Changes in the performance and efficiency of the VRF system according to the evaporating temperature and the number of operating indoor units were measured in a multi-calorimeter, and the effect of refrigerant evaporating temperature control on the reduction in the actual number of operating indoor units due to the Thermo off was examined under part-load conditions. In addition, the developed algorithm was applied to the office and education buildings in a factory located in Thai Nguyen city, Vietnam, and its energy-saving effect on the indoor temperatures was verified as per the energy effect verification process provided by the International performance measurement and verification protocol (IPMVP). The verification results confirmed that conducting refrigerant evaporating temperature control saves energy by increasing the Thermo on rate and the refrigerant evaporating temperature. It was additionally confirmed through the actual operation data that refrigerant evaporating temperature control has the effect of improving the indoor thermal environment by increasing the accuracy of indoor temperature control.",
