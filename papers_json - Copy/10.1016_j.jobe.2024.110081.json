Construction Automation & Robotics Group CSIR-CBRI Roorkee 247667 India Thermoelectric module-based air conditioners (TEM-AC) are scalable, reliable, and have the potential to replace conventional air conditioners. However, the coefficient of performance (COP) of TEM-AC is still relatively low. Improving the COP requires a combination of temperature control, voltage control, heat recovery, airflow control, and material selection. The present study focuses on enhancing COP of the TEM-AC for building space cooling. To control and monitor the parameters of the TEM-AC, a low-cost, IoT-enabled monitoring and controlling system (MCS) is developed. The MCS helps in TEM-AC system designing as it can apply different current pulses to improve cooling capacity and control the temperature difference between both surfaces. MCS also measure all the required parameters of the TEM-AC to calculate the COP of the system and helps in reducing the calculation time for each experiment. Using a developed technique and TEM-AC design, a performance comparison of eight experimental cases has been done. Experiments have been performed in normal and control modes with different heat sinks and airflow of TEM-AC. The TEM-AC system is installed over a 16-inch × 12-inch enclosed space with a TEC-12706 module. The study indicates the COP of the system is enhanced by controlling the cold side temperature and air flow rate. For this study, maximum COP is achieved around 0.44 with control operation. The developed IoT-based monitoring and controlling system offers a promising solution for improving the performance of thermoelectric modules in building space conditioning applications.

Most energy is used to maintain human comfort, especially thermal management. Buildings use conventional air conditioning systems to maintain thermal comfort, which consumes massive electric power [3]. Using air conditioning systems not only costs a large amount of energy but also adversely affects climate change and global warming [4]. During the cooling and heating operations, much energy is wasted due to building planning, construction, and control processes [5]. To overcome power consumption and environmental safety, many researchers are focusing on another way of thermal management, such as a thermoelectric module (TEM), which consumes less power and does not use any phase change material [6\u20138]. A TEM is a semiconductor-based electronic device that can convert electrical energy into a temperature gradient [9]. The most important advantage of this technology is that efficient temperature regulation (cooling and heating) can be achieved without polluting the environment. The device that converts electrical power into a temperature gradient is known as a Thermoelectric Cooler (TEC) [10]. TEC is a solid-state device that can be operated in cooling and heating modes depending on the direction of the current flowing [11]. Due to the low coefficient of performance (COP) compared to conventional air conditioning system, building applications has not been entirely explored [12]. Researchers are focusing on improving the COP of the TEC system for confined cooling. Amaia et al. [13] investigated TEC for cooling and heating and compared it with a conventional vapor compression system. They have found the performance of TEC non-satisfactory, and further optimization is needed to increase the COP by reducing input power and proper ventilation system. To improve the performance of TEC, thermo-electric ventilation systems with photovoltaics have been developed [14]. COP of TEC increases by reducing power consumption and enhancing the heat sink to emit heat flux to the environment. Various heat sinks, including fans, to control the heat exchange have been analyzed to improve performance [15]. Miao et al. and Seyednezhad et al. [16,17]. conducted an experimental study to investigate a panelized ground-source thermoelectric system for building space heating and cooling. Still, improvement in COP was poor even when the ground was used as a heat sink. Smart devices that monitor and control the input power of the TEM-based air conditioner (TEM-AC) can also improve the COP by optimizing the input power. Liqun Hou et al. [18] discuss the development of a smart air conditioning system that utilizes Internet of Things (IoT) technology to improve energy efficiency and user convenience. The authors conclude that the IoT-based smart air conditioning system has great potential to improve energy efficiency and user comfort in residential and commercial buildings. Ghezlane et al. [19] reviewed thermal comfort with an intelligence system. They concluded that implementing artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) improves the energy efficiency of intelligent buildings in terms of thermal comfort. Georgios et al. [20] discussed the role of IoT for future buildings and developed a framework for the progressive phasing of construction. During the era of intelligent buildings and Industry 4.0, everything is controlled remotely. IoT offers service and protocol to control multiple devices from one master using wireless communication [21]. IoT-based systems are used to control and monitor various processes remotely. Appliances like air conditioners and fans can be controlled using IoT based on the thermal comfort of the space. A considerable amount of energy can be saved with preset regulated temperatures through IoT [22]. Usman et al. [23] present a comprehensive study of the design, implementation, and deployment of an IoT-based smart energy management system (SEMS) for efficient energy consumption in buildings. The temperature gradient of TEM depends on the amplitude and direction of the current flowing through it. Optimization of electric energy can help to improve the COP. The cooling characteristics of a TEM-AC system operating under steady current and current pulses were discussed by Irshad et al. [24]. The pulse operation provides an additional average temperature reduction of 3\u20134 °C on the cold side of TECs [25]. Building an envelope with TEC and a radiative sky cooler can help to achieve COP around 2.0 [26]. Different types of current pulse operation can optimize the input power and get maximum cooling capacity. However, directly controlling the shape and amplitude of the current pulse is difficult. The cost of current-controlled methods is high compared with voltage-control methods [27]. Buchalik et al. [28] have done an economics analysis of commercially available TEM-based air conditioning systems. TEM-AC gives comparable power but is more expensive and has lower COP. TEC1-12706 TEC module-based air conditioner costs 0.7 and 1.4 dollars per 1 kWh of cooling [29]. Kubwimana et al. [30] in his work on radiant cooling system used thermoelectric modules as a source of energy for producing cooling effect. He performed CFD simulation and experimental investigation of Radiant -TEC system using a box of 1.5-m cube. A reduction of 0.5 °C temperature is observed on the radiant panel when four TEC modules are used. The research concludes that TEC cannot produce required thermal environment. TEC and Radiant System Hybrid cannot have energy savings due to the Low COP of TEC modules. Rui Miao et al. [31] worked on combining the ground source heat pump system with thermo electric modules to develop a hybrid panel for building space conditioning. The average COP of this hybrid system is 0.59 and calls for further studies for improving the COP. Gaoju Xia et al. [32] worked on TEC with different heat sink configurations, he concluded that for better COP of TEC system, the hot side air temperature should be minimized. Rahul Chandel et al. [33] in his work on semi-transparent thermoelectric module (STEM) panels powered by a photovoltaic system claimed that the TEC modules can provide necessary cooling requirements within small spaces of building proving a temperature difference of 10 °C consuming 1.7 KW. Lumin Shi et al. [34] worked on the economic aspects of TEC for air cooling, his work concluded that increasing the TEM modules number will reduce the overall cost and claimed that 6 joined TEM\u2019s are 35 % cost effective in compared with 4 joined TEM\u2019s. To make TEM-AC more commercialized and cost-effective, the input power of the TEM-AC needs to be controlled as voltage, not as current. This is because handling current needs a specific instrument, whereas voltage controlling is easy and can be achieved by any pulse width modulation (PWM) circuit [35]. As TEM-AC is a growing field for researchers, we have to calculate all the parameters of the TEC manually based on hot and cold side temperature, input voltage and current, and Seebeck coefficient. Accurate drivers are also needed to control the current direction and voltage amplitude to drive TEC in a dual mode of operation [36]. This study aimed to enhance the COP of the TEM-AC by utilizing an IoT-based device to control the input supply, cold side temperature, airflow, and heat sink configurations. To control and monitor the TEM-AC parameters, a unique, low-cost, IoT-enabled monitoring and controlling system (MCS) has been developed. The developed system monitors all the necessary parameters of the TEM and calculates the COP. MCS comprises three temperature sensors, a current sensor, a voltage detector, an LCD, a memory card, and two dual-channel drivers to control the input supply. Incorporating the ESP8266 microcontroller enables MCS for IoT connectivity, which controls and monitors the TEM-AC system from remote locations. MCS uses a memory card to store data on the system and an IoT cloud to transmit data to remote locations. The performance curves are drawn using the developed device for TEM model RS Pro 2172394 for parametric study. The curve helps to get the relationship between cold side temperature and operating voltage with respect to current. The IoT device can control the amplitude and direction of the power supply. It is a programmable device that can provide direct, pulsed, and controlled supply to the TEM-AC system, which helps to improve the COP. This study has discussed eight experiments with different heat sinks and cold-side fan airflow rates. The experimental approach has been followed to perform comparative analysis for COP of TEM-AC in normal mode and controlled mode of operations. For the study, two different sizes of heat sinks were used, and the cold-side airflow rate was controlled. COP of the TEM-AC has been calculated by varying the temperature set point while keeping other parameters the same. 2 Methodology and instrumentation This paper presents the development of an IoT-enabled monitoring and controlling unit for testing various input current controlling techniques, followed by experimental validation. The efficient functioning of a TEM-AC necessitates the optimization of several components, including the TEM itself, a heat sink on both the cold and hot sides, an exhaust and axial fan, devices for controlling the input supply to the cold side fan and TEM, temperature sensors, and feedback controls to maintain the desired temperature on the cold side. This section discusses the theory behind TEM, explaining the parameters' roles in enhancing the COP. Subsequently, the development of the IoT device is detailed, which not only monitors the temperature and power of the TEM-AC but also regulates the input supply to the cold side fan. The importance and methodology of current control techniques are also deliberated, followed by rectifying errors in the developed devices. 2.1 Thermoelectric module The thermoelectric module is a solid-state device that works on the principle of the Peltier effect. The heat emitted and absorbed from the surface of the TEM depends upon the Seebeck coefficient, joule heating, and thermal conductivity. According to the first law of thermodynamics, heat is a form of energy; it is the principle of energy conservation. At the steady state condition, heat removed from the cold surface, Qc, and heat emitted from a hot surface, Qh, is given by [37]. (1) Q c = S I T c − I 2 R 2 − K t h Δ T And (2) Q h = S I T h + I 2 R 2 − K t h Δ T The temperature difference between both sides of the TEM can be expressed as \u2013 (3) Δ T = T h − T c The input supply voltage of the TEM can be calculated as [38]\u2013 (4) V = S Δ T + R I The COP of the TEM-AC, considering the supply of TEM and fans, can be given as (5) C O P = Q c P t o t a l Where, P t o t a l = P T E M + P f There is a non-linear relation between heat absorbed at the cold side and current supplied to the TEM module. From equation (5), it is clear that the COP of the system can increase by reducing the input supply to the system or by reducing the thermal conductivity between both surfaces of TEM, which can be done with proper heat sink design. In this article, experiments have been done to reduce power consumption using control techniques with a developed IoT device and various heat sink models to reject maximum heat. 2.2 IoT-based monitoring system To perform the experiments and to develop a technique to improve the COP of the TEM-AC system, an IoT-enabled monitoring and controlling system (MCS) device is designed. The designed device monitors all the essential parameters of the TEM-AC and provides control to the power supply. The proposed cloud-based IoT architecture for climate control is shown in Fig. 1 (a). The architecture of IoT can be classified into three parts. The first part is a measurement or hardware layer. The second part is the decision-making or backend layer, and the third is the access gateway. The hardware layer enables the virtual world to interact with the real world using sensors and actuators. Microcontrollers, sensors and interfacing circuits are the main components of the hardware. In MCS, Arduino and ESP 8266 microcontrollers interface with sensors and actuators. Two PT100, a thermistor, voltage, and current sensors are used to measure the performance, and the specifications of the sensors are listed in Table 1 . The PWM-enabled module is used to control the current following through TEM. Sensors measure the required parameters of the TEM-AC, and the Arduino microcontroller processes that information. The gateway layer establishes the connection between the backend and sensors. ESP8266 microcontroller provides gateway layer support. Arduino transfers data to the ESP8266 microcontroller using serial communication protocols. The wireless capability of ESP8266 pushes recorded data to the cloud, and the dashboard of the cloud enables visualization and control of set points. The cloud-based dashboard is shown in Fig. 1 (b). Users can access data from IoT controllers using the backend layer. The backend layer provides access to the storage and firmware of the controller involved. The MCS comprises a controller unit, IoT device, storage device, display, and sensors, as shown in Fig. 1 (c). PT-100 resistance temperature detectors (RTD) are used to measure the hot side temperature and cold side temperature. RTD has a positive temperature coefficient. The MCS uses a two-wire configuration of pt100 with ±0.3 °C of accuracy and measures temperature in the range of −50 °C to +250 °C. The temperature coefficient of resistance value for this sensor is 0.00385 per °C. An analog negative temperature coefficient (NTC) thermistor measures test room temperature. A current sensor module is installed to measure the operating current. It has an ACS712 linear Hall effect IC, which measures current in proportional voltage form. This IC can measure current up to 30A. Voltage sensors can measure voltage ranges from 0 to 25VDC. The resolution of sensors depends on the ADC, which is about 0.00489 V. The micro SD card with SPI communication records the live data. Data is recorded in a comma-separated text file with a sampling rate of 12 Hz. This sampling rate can be increased further if needed. In the current scenario, the system is used to monitor the temperature system, which is already a slow process, and the sampling rate is kept to 12 Hz to save memory and power. MCS is a unique system developed to monitor the performance of the TEM continuously but is not limited to TEM only. MCS can also be used for general-purpose measurement or as an IoT multi-meter. The system uses a 16 GB micro card to store continuous data for 30 days. The dashboard on the cloud represents the recorded data in graphical format. It is also able to monitor and control from a remote location. The Novelty of MCS for TEM performance monitoring is that it can directly give us the temperature difference between the hot and cold side of the TEM (ΔT), the current flowing through TEM (I), the direction of the current and supply voltage (V). With the help of measured parameters, Seeback coefficient (S), Thermal resistance (Rth), cooling capacity, heat rejected from a hot surface, and COP can be calculated using equation (1) to equation (5). In this work, the developed device is used to monitor the cold and hot side of the temperature, input voltage, and current for fans and TEM, as well as control the input supply of the cold side fan. The developed device also controls the input supply of the TEM, which is not covered in this article. 2.3 TEM-AC current control unit Controlling the amplitude and direction of the current following through the TEM-AC system affects the COP of the system. It is crucial to choose the proper input current to get maximum cooling capacity and COP. As per the literature, different current pulses can also improve the COP. In this work, a system is developed to perform several experiments with different types of current pulses applied to TEM-AC with varying heat sinks. The designed IoT device can control the set point and current pulses used to TEM-AC from a remote location. It also monitors the temperature and power of TEM-AC and is very helpful in performing long-term experimentation. The temperature of the TEM surface can be controlled by controlling the current flowing through it, but electronically speaking, controlling a current directly is difficult and costly. Various researchers have done simulations and laboratory tests with a constant current source to improve the COP of TEM. However, in practice, controlling and providing a constant current source is not possible by keeping minimum cost and making a controlled current source is another area for the researcher. So, to keep driving simple and cheaper, an H-bridge-based TEM controller controls the amplitude and direction of the current flowing through the TEM. Another advantage of using an H-bridge driver is that the same controller can be used for both the cooling and heating operation of TEM in a precise manner. MDD10A driver is used for TEM, and the L298-2A driver is used to control the fan's speed. The average power dissipation across the MDD10A was around 0.679 W when the voltage varied from 5 to 10 V. For the MDD10A control unit, the TEM terminal voltage and current reach 12 V and 3.8 A, respectively, at total capacity (100 % duty cycle). The controller unit uses feedback from sensors and a cloud dashboard to change the amplitude and direction of the current flowing through TEM-AC. 2.4 Measurement errors and calibration of IoT device Calibration of each sensor associated with the MCS system has been done by comparing the results with standard available instruments. Error in the measurements has been minimize by using the gain factor. Measurement errors of MCS have been calculated and corrected to make it more accurate for analysis. Verification of measured temperature value is done with commercially available thermometers and voltage and current are verified with a digital power supply. The error between temperature measurements was found to be approximately ±0.3 °C. Error due to microcontroller Resolution: Without averaging, resolution error was found around ±0.05 °C for RTD and ±0.08 °C for the thermistor. On average, this error is reduced to ±0.02 °C for RTD and ±0.04 °C for the thermistor. Sensitivity Error between RTD1 and RTD2: Both sensors were installed on the single side of the TEM using thermal paste. Measurements have been done for a temperature range between 8 °C and 30 °C by varying the current flowing through the TEM. The error was limited to −0.68 to +0.77 °C with an average value of 0.42. The Error correction has been done concerning RTD1 and is restricted to 0.002 °C. 3 Results and discussion Designing the TEM-AC system involves selecting TEM devices, heat sinks, exhaust and axial fans, and input power supply modules. In this study, a thermoelectric device is chosen based on performance analysis. Various experiments are conducted to determine the heat sink and input current required to achieve maximum COP. The IoT device controls the TEM-AC system by adjusting the input power supply with different duty cycles (current supply time) and pulse shapes applied to cold side fan of the TEM-AC. 3.1 Performance analysis of TEM using MCS Performance analysis of the TEM-AC system is required to select suitable TEM devices to develop TEM-AC. Performance analysis has been done for RS Pro 2172394 and specifications used for analysis are listed in Table 2 , which are also required for COP calculation. The developed IoT device measures all the required parameters to calculate the COP and provide variation of COP with respect to time and input parameters. Heat flow from one surface to another depends upon the input power of the TEM. The variation of voltage and temperature of the TEM module with current is shown in Fig. 2 , which is measured by the developed IoT device. Experiments have been conducted by varying the voltage from 0 to 12.5 V. Fig. 2 (a) shows the relation between the voltage and current of TEM during operation with two heat sinks and a single fan. However, the fan's voltage and current are not added to the measurement during this experiment. It was also observed that the cold side and hot side temperatures of the TEM increase after 2.6 A current, but the temperature difference is maintained constant for steady-state operation. Fig. 2 (b) represent the variation of temperature difference with respect to TEM current. The relationship between current and temperature difference has been estimated using a third-order polynomial. Correlation coefficient between original data and polynomial is about 0.99. The relationship is given by \u2013 (6) Δ T = 1.59 I 3 − 2.41 I 2 + 6.61 I − 0.84 Similarly, linear estimation has been employed to approximate the relationship between current and voltage across the TEM, yielding a correlation coefficient of approximately 0.98, as follows\u2013 (7) V = 4.92 I − 1.5 Equations (6) and (7) depict the correlation between temperature difference, current, and voltage. This relationship enables users to ascertain the optimal input voltage to achieve the maximum COP of the TEMs. For instance, if users aim to regulate the cold-side temperature while keeping the hot-side temperature constant using heat sinks, they can determine the necessary current to achieve a specific temperature since current cannot be directly controlled but is instead controlled in voltage form, equation (7) aids in determining the precise input voltage required to maintain the cold-side temperature. The performance curve of TEM with two similar heat sinks on either side is shown in Fig. 3 , which is helpful for cooling and heating performance analysis. CO P calculation has been done by ignoring the thermal resistance of the heat sink but taking into consideration the temperature recorded on the heat sink surface. The performance curve helps to get the relationship between current, temperature, and COP, which is helpful for the optimization of the input current range to operate TEM with maximum capacity. As the current increases, the cold side temperature decreases. However, the COP also reduces due to the increasing temperature difference. TEM governing equations help to calculate the heat capacity of the cooling unit. To get a more accurate result, the thermal resistance of the heat sink can be included in a governing equation. The overall cooling capacity of the TEM-AC can be driven as a function of input current/voltage and thermal resistance of the system using the measurement done by MCS under study state conditions. Marzieh et al. conducted a thermodynamic study of TEM associated with two sinks. The effect of heat emission and absorption is a function of the thermal resistance of the sinks. The absorbed heat by the cold side and transferred to the hot side can be written as [39] \u2013 (8) Q c = T c − T h R E q (9) R E q = R s c + R T E M + R s h Rsc and Rsh are the thermal resistance of the cold- and hot-side heat sinks, respectively. Equation (8) can also be utilized to account for the thermal resistance of the heat sink. The performance curve depicted in Fig. 3 assists in determining the optimal voltage and current values for driving the TEM with maximum COP. 3.2 Techniques to improve the COP of TEM-AC COP of the TEM can be increased by optimizing the input power supply and proper heat flow from the TEM-AC's cold and hot side surfaces. An experimental approach is followed to determine the best input current and heat sink to achieve maximum COP of the TEM-AC system. Experiments were conducted using developed MCS to do comparative studies when different duty cycle current applied to TEM-AC. A test box measuring 16 inches by 12 inches and made of Sun-board material is utilized to perform case studies, as shown in Fig. 4 . The box incorporates a TEC1-12706 module with two different sizes of heat sinks mounted on its side. An exhaust fan is placed on the cooling side, while an axial fan is installed on the hot side heat sink to maintain the hot side temperature constant. In this paper, input current of cooling side fan is regulated to control the airflow and improve the COP of the TEM-AC system. The TEM operates at a constant voltage of 11.8 V, while the both fans are powered by 12 V. MCS monitors the power consumption and temperature of the TEM device. The experiments are conducted in both normal modes of operations and control modes of operations. In the normal mode, a constant current is supplied to run the cold side fan at a constant speed to the TEM-AC, whereas, in the control mode of operation, the input current of the cold side fan varies based on the duty cycle. The paper discusses the improvements in COP achieved by implementing the control mode of operation in the TEM-AC system and compares it with the normal mode of operation. All the control actions are performed using the controlling unit of the IoT-based MCS. Temperature is monitored using sensors, and the power supplied to the fans is controlled using the PWM technique with different temperature set points. Experiments were conducted with two aluminum alloy heat sinks (45 × 45 mm2 and 60 × 60 mm2) at the cold side while at the hot side a fixed size heat sink is with fan is used to keep temperature constant. During the experiments, the applied voltage remains constant, while only the current varies according to the temperature set point and duty cycle. As a result, power is directly proportional to the applied current. In all the case studies, we have included power, as they are essential for calculating the COP. Initially, experiments are conducted under a normal mode of operation, where the TEM and fans operate with total input supply. These normal mode experiments are carried out with two types of heat sinks. Subsequently, the performance of normal mode operations is compared in terms of COP with control mode operations, where the input supply of the cold side fan is adjusted based on the temperature set point. 3.2.1 Normal mode of operation As discussed, changing the input current of the TEM-AC changes the COP of the system, and experiments were conducted with different current waveforms (duty cycle) and heat sinks. COP of all the experiments compared with the normal mode of operation where the constant current is applied to TEM-AC. In normal mode, all the devices are operated at fixed power. An aluminum heat sink of size 45 × 45 mm2 is mounted on the cold side with a 12-V fan to transfer heat flux from TEM to the setup box. The experiment was done at an ambient temperature of 27 °C. The temperature of the cold side reaches 19 °C when the fan runs at full speed, then the temperature becomes constant, and a 2 °C drop occurs in box temperature when there is heat leakage in the setup box. Similar procedures were also done using another aluminum alloy heat sink of size 60 × 60 mm2. The change in the cold side temperature of TEM-AC for both cases in direct mode is shown in Fig. 5 . The power consumption of the system is listed in Table 3 . Increasing the size of the heat sink restricts the temperature drop at the cold side immediately as the heat capacity of the heat sink increases. The supplied power to the TEM is kept constant for all the experiments to study the effect of cold side air flow on the COP. The COP of the TEM-AC has been found to be approximately 0.02 and 0.32 for 45 × 45 mm2 and 60 × 60 mm2 heat sink, respectively. To enhance the COP of the TEM-AC system, experiments have been conducted by controlling the fan speed. PWM is utilized as a technique to regulate the input current of the fan by adjusting the duty cycle. The duty cycle determines the duration for which the current supply is active and inactive. A 50 % duty cycle indicates that the current will be supplied for half of the duration and will be off for the other half. During the off-time, the cold side temperature of the TEM decreases as the airflow is halted, while during the on-time, the fan transfers cold air from the TEM to the room, thereby increasing the temperature of the cold surface. Therefore, the TEM draws more current. An H-bridge driver is employed to control the amplitude and direction of the output based on the input PWM signal [40]. The use of IoT enables the modification of the duty cycles of the supply of the TEM-AC. Multiple experiments have been done by altering the set point, duty cycle, heat sink, and current controlling technique to reduce power consumption. 3.2.2 Control mode of operation with set point 16 °C, 45 × 45 mm2 heat sink and on-off controlling for cooling side fan Experiments were conducted to analyze the effect of the heat sink and airflow rate from the cold side temperature of TEM. In this section, three cases with different input currents of cold side fans, which are air flow rates, have been discussed. For the control application, a set point value of 16 °C is chosen to achieve the maximum cooling effect from the TEM. The fan's power supply is adjusted based on the set point value. In this case, 45 × 45 mm2 heat sink and fan is attached to cold surface of the TEM. Case Ⅰ: With 100 % Duty Cycle In this case, the duty cycle of the fan is maintained at 100 %. If the temperature exceeds the set point, the fan turns off, and it runs at full speed if the temperature drops below the set point value. Current also changes to zero and maximum values. The variation in cold side temperature and power of the fan is illustrated in Figs. 6 and 7 , respectively. The average power consumption is approximately 8.21 W, which is lower than that of the normal mode of operation with the same cooling capacity. The COP of the TEM-AC has been found to be approximately 0.18. Case Ⅱ: With 50 % Duty Cycle An experiment has been conducted to investigate the effects of reducing the duty cycle on the fan's current and the system's COP. The results, depicted in Figs. 6 and 7, show the variation in cold side temperature and fan\u2019s power consumption. By reducing the duty cycle to 50 % in the PWM control, the fan operates at half speed, and the airflow rate decreases accordingly. As a result, the TEM requires less effort to achieve the same cold side temperature. Consequently, the current needed for the TEM also decreases, leading to an improvement in both COP and cooling capacity. The COP of the TEM-AC has been found to be approximately 0.16. Case Ⅲ: Dynamic Duty Cycle with a step size of 4 % Frequent power cycling of electronic equipment can reduce service life due to wear and tear. To achieve dynamic control, step controllers are preferred. In this particular case, the duty cycle of the fan varies based on the set point temperature. If the temperature is lower than the set point value, the duty cycle increases, decreasing by 4 % if the temperature exceeds the set point value. This approach allows the TEM to reach a lower temperature before the fan starts operating at minimum speed. Gradually, the fan's speed increases until the cold surface temperature exceeds the set point temperature. At a steady state, the average power consumption by cold side fan is approximately 7.7 W, with the cold side temperature being maintained. The variation in temperature and power can be observed in Figs. 6 and 7, respectively. The COP of the TEM-AC has been found to be approximately 0.09. Case IV: With set point 12 °C and Dynamic Duty Cycle with a step size of 4 % In this case analysis has been done by keeping all setting same as case III only set point has been changed to 12 °C. At a steady state, the average power consumption by cold side fan is approximately 7.47 W, with the cold side temperature being maintained. The variation in temperature and power can be observed in Figs. 6 and 7, respectively. The COP of the TEM-AC has been found to be approximately −0.01. 3.2.3 Control mode of operation with set point 20 °C, 60 × 60 mm2 heat sink and on-off controlling for cooling side fan \u2013 In this case, experiments are conducted using a 60 × 60 mm2 heat sink with fan. The set point is chosen at 20 °C. Case studies with an on-off controller and a step controller have been discussed. Case Ⅰ: with 100 % Duty Cycle In this case, the average cold surface temperature increases in response to the set point, as demonstrated in Fig. 8 . Additionally, when the system runs for 1200 s, the average power consumption by cold side fan is approximately 7.27 W, as shown in Fig. 9 . The COP of the TEM-AC has been found to be approximately 0.44. Case Ⅱ: Dynamic Duty Cycle with a step size of 4 % In this case, the duty cycle undergoes a 4 % change based on a set point. The average power consumption is approximately 7.71 W when the system operates for 1200 s. The variation in heat sink temperature and power consumption by the fans can be observed in Figs. 8 and 9, respectively. The COP of the TEM-AC has been found to be approximately 0.34. Fig. 10 illustrates the variation in COP for each case over time as the current is adjusted, as previously discussed. Developed device is directly able to provide variation of COP with time. Analysis of the plot indicates that COP correlates with the current supplied to the cold side fan. It is observed that the COP reaches its peak when using the 60 × 60 mm2 heat sink. Table 4 presents a list of experiments conducted with various configurations, and the average COP for each case is shown. The percentage change in power consumption is also calculated by comparing the results to the normal operation mode for both heat sinks. The table shows that COP, power consumption and cold side temperature should be selected based on the application. It can also be noticed that as the size of the heat sink increases, the COP also increases, and power consumption decreases. Based on the experiments, it is concluded that by changing the speed of associated fans and heat sinks with TEM-AC, COP and cooling capacity can be improved. A comparative study by Gaoju Xia et al. [32] used various heat sink configurations to enhance COP, achieving a 22.8 % increase. In contrast, this work has resulted in a COP improvement of 37.5 %. 4 Conclusions An IoT-based monitoring and controlling unit (MCS) has been developed to improve the COP of the TEM-AC. The MCS includes temperature, voltage, and current sensors to calculate the TEM-AC's COP. The developed MCS optimizes input supply of the TEM-AC to improve COP and achieve maximum cooling capacity. In this article, total eight case studies have been done by varying the air flow from cold side surface of the TEM. For each case COP of the TEM-AC has been calculated and plotted by using developed MCS. The study identifies cold side temperature, airflow rate, and power consumption as key factors influencing the COP of the TEM-AC. The findings suggest that using a larger heat sink and maintaining a higher set point for the cold side temperature maximizes COP, as these conditions also minimize airflow rate and power consumption. Specifically, case VII emerges as the optimal scenario for TEM-AC development, achieving a COP of approximately 0.44 while maintaining the cold side temperature within the range of human thermal comfort.

        "dc:description": "Thermoelectric module-based air conditioners (TEM-AC) are scalable, reliable, and have the potential to replace conventional air conditioners. However, the coefficient of performance (COP) of TEM-AC is still relatively low. Improving the COP requires a combination of temperature control, voltage control, heat recovery, airflow control, and material selection. The present study focuses on enhancing COP of the TEM-AC for building space cooling. To control and monitor the parameters of the TEM-AC, a low-cost, IoT-enabled monitoring and controlling system (MCS) is developed. The MCS helps in TEM-AC system designing as it can apply different current pulses to improve cooling capacity and control the temperature difference between both surfaces. MCS also measure all the required parameters of the TEM-AC to calculate the COP of the system and helps in reducing the calculation time for each experiment. Using a developed technique and TEM-AC design, a performance comparison of eight experimental cases has been done. Experiments have been performed in normal and control modes with different heat sinks and airflow of TEM-AC. The TEM-AC system is installed over a 16-inch × 12-inch enclosed space with a TEC-12706 module. The study indicates the COP of the system is enhanced by controlling the cold side temperature and air flow rate. For this study, maximum COP is achieved around 0.44 with control operation. The developed IoT-based monitoring and controlling system offers a promising solution for improving the performance of thermoelectric modules in building space conditioning applications.",
