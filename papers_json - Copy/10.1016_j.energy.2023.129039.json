In the context of the increasing popularity of distributed energy, this paper proposes a home energy management system method considering the working state of flexible load to deal with the problem of mismatch between home energy supply and demand. Specifically, in this paper, the flexible load in the system is studied, and the model of flexible load and its working state are established. On this basis, combined with the real-time electricity price of the grid, the model of home energy management system is constructed to minimize the electricity purchase cost and improve the utilization rate of renewable energy, the genetic algorithm is used to solve it, and the influence of time step, flexible load ratio and whether to use energy storage equipment on the optimization degree of the model are analyzed. The research results show that, while meeting the requirements of human comfort and electricity demand, the daily electricity purchase cost of the system with flexible load scheduling is 22.5% lower than that of the system without flexible load scheduling, and the utilization rate of renewable energy is increased by 16.5%. In terms of model optimization, shortening the prediction time step, increasing the proportion of flexible load and using energy storage equipment can further reduce the electricity purchase cost.

In recent years, with the increase of renewable energy integration, the application of distributed energy generation in home energy management system (HEMS) has been widely concerned. At the same time, with the continuous development of demand response (DR) and intelligent technology, it is widely believed that HEMS is an effective way to alleviate global warming and energy shortage problems. Moreover, it is one of the effective ways to reduce the electricity purchase cost, improve the energy efficiency of buildings, relieve the power grid pressure and improve the energy management level [3\u20135]. At present, the researches on HEMS mainly focus on the structural design of the system and the optimization of energy scheduling strategy [6\u20138]. In terms of the structural design of the system, in the traditional power supply mode, users can only take electricity from the grid as consumers in one way, while in the smart grid, the flow of energy and information are bidirectional. The user can transmit energy as a seller and a consumer, which improves the power quality and the economy of energy use [9,10]. In Refs. [11\u201313], authors believed that it is not cost-effective for HEMS when renewable energy is not integrated, thus, building energy consumption cannot be reduced. In Ref. [14], the systems with or without energy management are compared from the perspective of energy saving. The results showed that the proposed energy management based on fuzzy logic technology saves 26.49% and 25.54% energy in winter and summer, respectively. In literature [15], a HEMS model was established based on time-of-use pricing mode, in which used solar photovoltaic system is used as supplementary energy. The proposed HEMS model aims at adjusting the running of electrical appliances by using photovoltaic battery system without affecting the comfort of users. The reliability of the model was verified by case analysis, and the results showed that the electricity cost could be effectively reduced by 15% even under the condition of maximum power consumption. In order to save electricity costs without sacrificing the comfort of users, both the output of renewable energy system and energy storage system were considered in the HEMS. The results showed that the system explored had high economic benefits [16]. In Ref. [17], electric vehicles were introduced as energy storage devices, the charge and discharge mode of electric vehicles were modeled, based on which, the electricity cost can be minimized by energy consumption management and control. The integration of energy storage system into HEMS can further adjust the uncertainty of the output of renewable energy such as wind and solar energy, but the increased equipment cost is rarely considered, which hinders its development in rural areas. Regarding the optimization of scheduling strategy, different optimization algorithms (e.g., mathematical methods and heuristic algorithms) can be implemented to delay or reduce the operation of controllable equipment. Meanwhile, indicators (e.g., the total cost of energy, the electricity purchase cost of building users, the utilization rate of renewable energy, the user's comfort and carbon emission) can be concerned for the optimization objectives. Therefore, the power consumption can be reduced during peak hours, energy efficiency can be improved, and residential comfort can be achieved [18,19]. Among the mathematical optimization methods, the mixed integer nonlinear programming is the most common problem. In dynamic programming, the problem is composed of multiple stages, that is, scheduling decisions are made sequentially and one at a time, instead of making decisions independently at each time interval [20,21]. However, among the problems of large-scale planning, the mathematical optimization algorithm is complicated, while the heuristic algorithm is more convenient. Commonly used heuristic algorithms include genetic algorithm (GA) [22], particle swarm optimization [23] and so on. Based on the particle swarm optimization algorithm, Chen et al. [24] considered the energy storage cost and outage loss, and reasonably decided the energy storage capacity to reduce the total cost, but the thermal comfort was not considered. In addition, flexible loads have been demonstrated to have the ability of optimizing the load curve, thereby the economy of energy use can be improved [25,26]. Ref. [27] established the aggregation models of ON-OFF flexible loads and continuously adjustable flexible loads to reduce the system error and have a better respond to the DR in smart grid. In Ref. [28], load scheduling was performed in advance through HEMS based on mixed integer linear programming to reduce costs and provide optimal DR and PV self-consumption. In Ref. [29], in order to reduce the load difference between the peak load section and the valley load section in the process of power load dispatching and improve the stability of power operation, a distributed forward-looking dispatching scheme for intelligent buildings was proposed to smooth the power fluctuation in the distribution network. Shakir M et al. [30] proposed a prediction model based on long short-term memory and an optimization model based on GA, which were used in HEMS. The experimental results showed that the proposed model can stably predict the daily energy demand, and the algorithm used can realize the optimal scheduling of residential energy without sacrificing user comfort. Therefore, the lowest electricity expenditure can be achieved. Based on the end-user preference in Ref. [31], the mathematical models of electrical equipment, typical photovoltaic power generation system and energy storage system in the building are established, and the total energy cost, peak load and carbon emission are optimized by using mixed integer linear programming algorithm. The results showed that it can save up to 20% of energy cost and 50% of peak demand. The equipment was arranged to actively respond to the DR signal and to obtain economic benefits. In Ref. [32], an advanced HEMS considering the user's habit of setting time and temperature was proposed, and the model is verified by comparison with the traditional HEMS. In general, energy management of buildings can not only optimize the allocation of resources, but also minimize the cost of purchasing electricity and maximize the economy under the condition of meeting the user's electricity demand. Nowadays, with the popularization of renewable energy and smart home appliances in rural areas, it is of great significance to carry out energy management for rural houses to promote energy conservation and emission reduction [33]. Although rural areas have vast land and huge potential for clean energy development, energy use is also relatively dispersed. If centralized power transmission and distribution is adopted, it will not only cost a lot of investment and loss, but also difficult to meet the diversified needs of rural energy use. Distributed energy can fully tap the resource potential of rural areas and enhance rural energy self-sufficiency. With the application of distributed energy, the real-time dynamic monitoring and prediction of energy data in HEMS are still facing great challenges. For the integration of multiple energy sources, on the one hand, it alleviates the uncertainty of distributed energy supply, on the other hand, it increases the difficulty of coordinated management. Most of the existing research has looked at economic benefits, the time shifting characteristics of flexible load is commonly used on the optimization scheduling strategy, based on which the model is developed. On the premise of meeting the electricity demand of residential users, the load is transferred to the time period with more renewable energy power generation or the time period with relatively low electricity price. However, the working state model of the power load is rarely considered, and the impact of flexible load on the performance of HEMS is rarely considered and quantitated. Therefore, in this paper, the dwellings in southern Anhui were taken as the studied buildings. To solve the problems of high power purchase cost and low utilization rate of renewable energy caused by energy mismatch in home energy management system, a HEMS model based on flexible scheduling was proposed by combining the electrical load characteristics of household equipment with the real-time electricity price of power grid. The time range of electrical appliances were set according to the electricity consumption habits of residents. The genetic algorithm was used to solve the model. Finally, comparative analysis of economy and energy saving were carried out for the HEMS models with and without flexible scheduling to verify the effectiveness of the proposed flexible load model. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, the proposed mathematical model of flexible load and its working state are generally described, and the optimization model of load scheduling is established. Then, the simulation results are given in Section 3, and the factors affecting the optimization degree of the model are discussed in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 presents the conclusions and future work. 2 Methods 2.1 Household load characteristics and classification Household electricity load can be classified into rigid load and flexible load according to the operation characteristics and demand of household electricity equipment. Flexible load can also be divided into uninterruptible load and interruptible load according to its time elasticity [34,35]. The electrical characteristics of various loads are shown in Fig. 1 . In the figure, [ ∂ a , β a ] indicates the period when the device can run normally and [ t a s t a r t , t a e n d ] indicates the period when the device works. Generally, loads with constant power and stable operation are called rigid loads (Fig. 1(a)) (e.g., lighting, refrigerator, etc.). While loads that must be operated continuously after the equipment is switched on and whose operating time can be shifted are called uninterruptible loads (Fig. 1(b)) (e.g., electric cooker, dishwasher, etc.). Loads that can be interrupted during the work are called interruptible loads (Fig. 1(c)) (e.g., air conditioning, water heater, etc.). 2.2 Household energy system model 2.2.1 Flexible load model As the rigid load belongs to the household essential electricity load, it is an unadjustable load, which needs to be met first. According to the characteristics of flexible load time elasticity, it is necessary to establish a mathematical model to determine whether the load needs continuous power supply or intermittent power supply. Uninterruptible load: it has the characteristics of continuity and cannot be suspended during operation. Its mathematical model is shown in Eq. (1). (1) { ∂ a ≤ t a s t a r t ≤ h a ≤ t a e n d ≤ β a , a ∈ 1,2 , ⋯ , m d a ≤ β a − ∂ a + 1 x a h = 1 , h ∈ [ t a s t a r t , t a e n d ] x a h = 0 , h ∉ [ t a s t a r t , t a e n d ] E a = P a × d a t a e n d − t a s t a r t + 1 = d a Where, a is the serial number of the user's electrical equipment, m is the number of uninterruptible loads; t a s t a r t and t a e n d are respectively the start and end time of the operation of the equipment; h a is the possible operating time of the device; P a and E a are rated power and total power of the equipment respectively; d a is the working time of the device, that is the total running time of the device ( ∑ h ∈ ∀ h a x a h ). If the equipment is working normally, it is denoted by x a h = 1 . When the device is not in the working range, it is denoted by x a h = 0 . Interruptible load: it can be turned on or off at will within the allowed working period, and its mathematical model is shown as Eq. (2). (2) { ∂ a ≤ t a s t a r t ≤ h a ≤ t a e n d ≤ β a , a ∈ m + 1 , ⋯ , m + n E a = P a × d a d a ≤ β a − ∂ a + 1 x a h = { 0,1 } , h ∈ ∀ h a ∑ h ∈ ∀ h a x a h = d a ∑ ∂ a β a x a h × P a = E a Where, n is the number of interruptible loads, which is numbered after the uninterruptible loads, so m + 1 , ⋯ , m + n are the serial number of interruptible loads. 2.2.2 Flexible load working state model In order to facilitate calculation, the working state of flexible load in the HEMS is modeled. In the algorithm, the scheduling cycle is a day and the simulation step is 0.5 h, so there are 48 periods in total. The device's 24-h working state matrix is shown in Eq. (3). (3) X a = { x a h , h ∈ 1,2 , ⋯ , 48 } = [ x a 1 x a 2 ⋯ x a 48 ] The working state matrix ( X A ) of all household flexible loads in a day is obtained as Eq. (4). (4) X A = { X a , a ∈ 1,2 , ⋯ , m + n } = [ x 1 1 x 1 2 ⋮ ⋮ ⋯ x 1 48 ⋮ ⋮ x m 1 x m 2 x m + 1 1 x m + 1 2 ⋯ x m 48 ⋯ x m + 1 48 ⋮ ⋮ x m + n 1 x m + n 2 ⋮ ⋮ ⋯ x m + n 48 ] The power consumption matrix ( P A ) of flexible loads is obtained by multiplying the working state matrix of all flexible loads and the corresponding rated power matrix of flexible loads, respectively. The consumption matrix is obtained as Eq. (5). (5) P A = X A × P a = [ x 1 1 P 1 ⋮ x m 1 P m x 1 2 P 1 ⋮ x m 2 P m ⋯ ⋮ ⋯ x 1 48 P 1 ⋮ x m 48 P m x m + 1 1 P m + 1 x m + 1 2 P m + 1 ⋮ ⋮ x m + n 1 P m + n x m + n 2 P m + n ⋯ x m + 1 48 P m + 1 ⋮ ⋮ ⋯ x m + n 48 P m + n ] Flexible load working state matrix ( X A ) and power consumption matrix ( P A ) are used to analyze the working state set of equipment groups under different flexible electricity loads. The purpose of optimal scheduling of home energy management center is to make flexible load find the optimal power consumption matrix under the condition of satisfying its own constraints, so that the objective function of home energy management and scheduling can reach the optimal state. 2.3 Household energy system scheduling objectives 2.3.1 Objective function and constraints For building users, the mode of economic optimization is to minimize the cost of purchasing electricity. When electricity generated by renewable energy cannot meet the power demand of building users, the cost generated by purchasing electricity from the power grid according to the power demand of building users. The expression of purchased electricity is shown as Eq. (6). (6) E G i = E O i + ∑ a = 1 m + n E a i − E R i Eq. (6) represents the electricity purchased by users from the power grid at different time periods. Where E G i is the electricity required by users in the municipal power grid during the period i ; E O i , E R i and ∑ a = 1 m + n E a i are respectively the electricity consumption of rigid load, renewable energy usage and total electricity consumption of all flexible loads of users at time period i . When E G i ≥ 0, it means that the distributed power generation at period i does not meet the power consumption demand of building users. Otherwise, if it is satisfied, the amount of electricity will be abandoned. When the distributed generation is insufficient to meet the power demand of the building, the electricity purchase cost of user from the grid at this time period i is shown in Eq. (7). (7) C i = E G i ∙ λ G i , E G i ≥ 0 , i = 1,2 , ⋯ , 24 Where C i and λ G i respectively represent the power purchase cost and power grid price of users in time period i . At the same time, the purchasing power of the building from the power grid in time period i should be less than or equal to the maximum allowable purchasing power of the building ( B Max i ) at this time. The constraint condition is: (8) E G i ≤ B Max i Based on the above formulas, the obtained economically optimal objective function is: (9) min ∑ i = 1 24 C i 2.3.2 Genetic algorithm optimization scheduling GA can be coded in binary, so it can be used to represent the working state of household electrical equipment in different time periods. For example, 0 indicates that the electrical equipment is not working, and 1 indicates that the electrical equipment is working. Due to the characteristics of GA itself, it can globally optimize the objective function whether continuous or discontinuous, linear or nonlinear [36,37]. Since the operation period of some electrical equipment is half an hour, and the measured data of wind and solar energy are collected once an hour, the mean value is adopted to represent the power generation of wind and solar energy per half an hour. Then there are 48 time operating periods of electric equipment in a day, which the running state of an electric equipment is a vector of 48 columns in one row as shown in Eq. (3). In this paper, the objective function takes economic optimization as the scheduling model, which can be expressed as the smaller the difference between renewable energy generation and electricity consumption, the better, and the smaller the objective function value, the better. But for genetic algorithms, only the larger the fitness value of the dyeing group will be possible for the next iteration. The objective function value and fitness value present the opposite relationship, and the minimum objective function presents the maximum fitness value, so this paper takes the reciprocal of the objective function as the fitness function of the genetic function. Therefore, its objective function is shown as Eq. (10). (10) m i n C o s t = ∑ i = 1 24 C i The algorithm flow of flexible load scheduling model for home energy management is shown in Fig. 2 . The specific steps are shown below. Step 1 Establish mathematical models of different loads, and define the the operating time periods and time lengths of the different electrical equipment. Step 2 Create the initial population. Step 3 Update the operation status matrix of the electrical equipment. Step 4 Establish the fitness function, and select excellent individuals by the roulette wheel. Step 5 Judge whether the electrical equipment is uninterruptible or not. Step 6 Create a new generation of populations through selection, crossover and mutation. Step 7 Judge whether the total electricity consumption time of the electrical equipment is equal to the initial set operation time. If so, the working matrix of the electrical equipment is output. If not, it is returned to the third step. 3 Case studies and simulation results 3.1 Load parameters of household equipment Taking a single-family residential building in southern Anhui as an example, the structure of its energy management system is shown in Fig. 3 . HEMS includes renewable energy systems, smart electrical appliance systems, smart meters, controllers, energy storage systems, and power grids. The addition of energy storage system can further adjust the contradiction between supply and demand mismatch, and can store excess renewable energy for electrical use in time. It can also purchase electricity in the period of low electricity price to avoid peak electricity consumption and play the role of energy transfer. The parameter settings of the electricity operation of household equipment are shown in Table 1 . The rigid load is the necessary electricity load, so the working time is within the working interval time, while flexible load can be scheduled within the working interval to change the running time and set the working time. The electrical equipment in the building includes lighting lamps, television, computer, washing machine, water heater, electric cooker, air conditioners, refrigerator and electric vehicle, etc. At the same time, the use of the electrical equipment is clarified according to the functions and characteristics of the electrical equipment. It is assumed that users can only charge electric vehicle at night. In addition, the operation of the household air conditioners are related to the seasonal and outdoor environment temperature. In order to save electricity, air conditioners are only used in summer and winter, and the air conditioners are discontinued in the transition season. 3.2 Analysis of optimization results 3.2.1 Minimum electricity purchase cost There is more renewable energy generation in the summer than in the winter and more electricity is discarded in the absence of energy storage. Therefore, a typical day in summer was studied. When the load scheduling algorithm was not used, users arranged the working time of the flexible load in the front part of the allowable working time of the electrical equipment. From Fig. 4 , it can be seen that the electricity generation of renewable energy has a low matching degree with the electricity consumption of building load. In the period of 10:00am\u201319:30pm, there is a serious waste of renewable energy power supply, while in the period of 20:00pm\u201323:30pm and 0:00am\u20139:30am, household electrical equipment cannot use renewable energy generation to meet electricity demand. Especially in the night, building load is large while renewable energy generation is less. Therefore, when the electricity demand of building electrical equipment is not met, it is necessary to supply enough electricity from the grid. Combined with the real-time electricity price of the power grid, the electricity purchase cost can be calculated to be CNY 11.78. As shown in Fig. 5 , after load dispatching, a part of the building flexible electricity consumption is transferred to 10:00am−11:30am and 15:00pm−19:30pm. At the same time, due to the constraints of some of the electrical equipment, electricity demand can not be arranged in the moment of more renewable energy generation such as the period between 11:00am−15:00pm. In order to bridge the gap between supply and demand, when renewable energy can not meet the demand of building load, building users need to buy electricity from the power grid. The electricity purchase cost is CNY 9.13. Fig. 6 shows the optimization results of dwellings in southern Anhui after using load scheduling algorithm. The matching degree of renewable energy generation and building electricity consumption is higher than that without load scheduling algorithm. Due to the living habits of residents in southern Anhui, electricity equipment is less used in the daytime, the renewable energy generation can meet the needs of household electrical equipment. On the contrary, a large amount of electrical equipment work at night leads to large electricity load, and the renewable energy generation cannot meet the demand of building electricity. In this case, the load scheduling algorithm is used to transfer part of the electrical equipment to a period of sufficient renewable energy to improve the utilization rate of renewable energy. 3.2.2 Utilization rate of renewable energy In order to reflect the renewable energy utilization rate of the dwelling before and after load dispatching, the renewable energy generation and consumption of building at different times are compared. As shown in Fig. 7 , prior to load scheduling, electricity consuming equipment mainly works at night. However, the amount of renewable energy generated at night is less. Therefore, all the power generation at night can be used by buildings, while there is more waste of renewable energy power generation in the daytime. According to the formula of renewable energy utilization rate, as shown in Eq. (11), the renewable energy utilization rate is 53.92%. (11) ω R E R = E t o t , u E t o t , g Where ω R E R is the renewable energy utilization rate, E t o t , u and E t o t , g are the total renewable energy usage and total renewable energy generation, respectively. Fig. 8 shows the comparison of renewable energy generation and usage of residential buildings in southern Anhui under the condition of load dispatching and real-time electricity price. Compared with Fig. 7, the usage of renewable energy increased significantly in the afternoon, while the utilization rate of renewable energy decreased in some moments, such as 00:30am. This is due to the optimization of renewable energy under the control of global electricity optimization to improve the overall utilization rate of renewable energy, but not to sacrifice the overall interests in order to improve the utilization rate of renewable energy at some local moments. Due to the constraints of some of the electrical equipment, electricity demand can not be arranged in the moment of more renewable energy generation, there is a lot of waste of renewable energy for the time between 12:00pm and 15:00pm. Through the calculation of renewable energy utilization rate formula, the renewable energy utilization rate is increased to 70.42%. 4 Discussion In this part, we further analyze the influence of different factors on model precision control. Three factors are employed for further discussion, including the different time steps and the proportion of flexible load and whether to use energy storage equipment. The results and a more specific discussion of each section are shown below. 4.1 Time step The predicted time step is reduced to half of the original value, that is, the time step is 0.25 h. The predicted renewable energy generation and residential building power consumption are shown in Fig. 9 . Compared with Fig. 5, renewable energy generation is further utilized during the 13:00 p.m.-17:00 p.m., reducing energy waste. Table 2 shows the energy use and the required electricity purchase cost of the building under different prediction steps. The utilization rate of renewable energy with a projected step length of 0.25 h has increased and the cost of electricity purchases has decreased by 6.7% compared with the original value. This is because the shorter the forecast time is, the more accurate the control of the equipment will be, and more equipment will be transferred to a period of sufficient renewable energy generation. 4.2 Flexible load ratio In order to better reflect the effectiveness of the model and optimization algorithm for flexible load scheduling in HEMS, the energy supply and demand in the transition season are studied. Figs. 10 and 11 show the energy consumption changes of residential buildings in one day before load scheduling and the optimization results of typical daily load scheduling respectively in the transition season. Electricity is mainly purchased at night. The electric vehicle is charged at night, and insufficient renewable energy can not meet their electricity demand, resulting in large electricity purchase. Fewer devices are switched on during the day, so renewable energy can meet demand and excess power is discarded. Different from a typical day in summer, air conditioners are not used in the transition season, which reduces the total energy consumption of buildings. It is noted that the use of other equipment is exactly the same as that on the typical day in summer. Table 3 shows the parameters before and after load scheduling in summer and transition season. The flexible load accounts for 71.22% and 53.44% of typical days in summer and transition season, respectively. After using load dispatching, the utilization rate of renewable energy is increased by 30.6% and 4.67% respectively, and the power purchase cost is decreased by 22.51% and 15.26% respectively. Therefore, the optimization degree of load scheduling is also related to the proportion of flexible load. As the proportion of flexible load increases, the objective optimization becomes more significant. 4.3 Battery energy storage As is depicted in Fig. 4, the peak of building electricity consumption is concentrated in the evening, while the peak of renewable energy generation is concentrated in the noon. Therefore, renewable energy generation can meet the building electricity demand at noon, but not at night. It can be seen from Fig. 8 that the overall utilization rate of renewable energy can be improved by scheduling measures in a small range. Taking the above issues into consideration, the battery energy storage system is integrated into HEMS in this section to timely store the surplus power during the noon peak hours of renewable energy generation and use it during the night peak hours to improve the utilization rate of renewable energy. And the general specifications of the battery storage system [38] are given in Table 4 . Fig. 12 shows the battery charging and discharging process after load optimization for residential buildings with energy storage equipment and real-time electricity price. The bar chart shows the process of distributed energy generation and the grid charging the battery or the process of the battery supplying power to the building electrical equipment. For the period when renewable energy cannot meet the demand of building load, it is necessary to purchase electricity from the grid. After energy storage optimization, the purchased electricity cost is CNY 6.7, which is 26.62% less than that without energy storage equipment. This is similar to the effect achieved in literature [39] based on the battery integration strategy. Fig. 13 shows the comparison of renewable energy generation and usage after energy storage optimization. The renewable energy generation can be well utilized in most of the time periods, and the renewable energy utilization rate reaches 90.07% at this time. Compared with the residential buildings without energy storage equipment, the utilization rate of renewable energy in southern Anhui increased by 19.65%. 5 Conclusion In this study, the models of flexible load and its working state are proposed. Under the condition of renewable energy power generation and real-time electricity price, the flexible load of residential buildings in southern Anhui was optimized by load scheduling, in which, the optimization was formulated with the goal of minimizing the purchase cost. GA was applied to obtain the optimal relationship between the renewable energy generation and the demand for building electricity. The electricity time period of the flexible load was adjusted to match the renewable energy generation, and then the optimal flexible load working state was obtained to realize the maximum utilization of renewable energy. The utilization rate of renewable energy was increased by 16.5% compared with that of the residence without load scheduling. The electricity purchase cost was reduced by 22.5% when the load scheduling was used to transfer some electrical equipment that were used at night to a period with low real-time price or large distributed generation. The influence of prediction time step and flexible load ratio on the optimization results were studied. The analysis further verified the effectiveness of the model and algorithm. At the same time, it was found that a shorter time step and a larger proportion of flexible load can improve the matching degree between the power generation of renewable energy and the power consumption of residential buildings by using the scheduling model, thus the utilization rate of renewable energy is improved and the cost of power purchase is reduced. Compared with the system with energy storage equipment, the results show that based on the load scheduling strategy, the operation cost of the battery integration strategy was reduced by 26.62%, and the utilization rate of renewable energy was increased by 19.65%. Future works will be conducted by introducing energy storage devices (e.g electric vehicles) to reconstruct the distributed energy generation from the perspective of energy conservation and carbon reduction, and combining big data and artificial intelligence automatic analysis through intelligent technology to form a model of \"household photovoltaic + household energy storage + electric vehicles\". Then considering the characteristics of seasonal energy use in rural areas, a village energy management system is established to adjust the residential electricity consumption within a certain range.

        "dc:description": "In the context of the increasing popularity of distributed energy, this paper proposes a home energy management system method considering the working state of flexible load to deal with the problem of mismatch between home energy supply and demand. Specifically, in this paper, the flexible load in the system is studied, and the model of flexible load and its working state are established. On this basis, combined with the real-time electricity price of the grid, the model of home energy management system is constructed to minimize the electricity purchase cost and improve the utilization rate of renewable energy, the genetic algorithm is used to solve it, and the influence of time step, flexible load ratio and whether to use energy storage equipment on the optimization degree of the model are analyzed. The research results show that, while meeting the requirements of human comfort and electricity demand, the daily electricity purchase cost of the system with flexible load scheduling is 22.5% lower than that of the system without flexible load scheduling, and the utilization rate of renewable energy is increased by 16.5%. In terms of model optimization, shortening the prediction time step, increasing the proportion of flexible load and using energy storage equipment can further reduce the electricity purchase cost. The case study confirms the effectiveness of the proposed home energy management system model, which can provide an efficient optimal scheduling scheme for household energy saving.",
