Smart metering and the internet of things (IoT) accumulate massive time-series building data. Mining operation patterns from time-series data have huge potential to provide extra information for improving energy efficiency. Previous studies mainly focused on mining control patterns of the heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning system (HVAC). Mining operational patterns from time-series data can help building managers identify energy-wasting operations. This study proposes three methods of mining the operation hours on the time-series data of hundreds of buildings. A key performance indicator (KPI) of facility hours is proposed to indicate the discrepancy between occupants\u2019 requirements and facility hours. The study is carried out on the 240 office buildings of building data genome project 2 (BDG2). The proposed methods are evaluated by comparing mined hours with annotated hours. The impacts of eight operational KPIs are quantified with correlation coefficients and ensemble learning. The practicality of the proposed methods is evaluated on three case buildings. The results show that the cumulative histogram method is effective in mining operation hours. The regression results indicate that mined KPIs can improve the energy prediction accuracy (R2) from 0.35 to 0.41. The impacts of operational KPIs reveal that the KPI of weekends has a tremendous impact on energy consumption. The case study results show that reducing unnecessary facility hours can save from 2.9% to 10.6% energy. This study verifies that operational KPIs mined from time-series data can provide building managers with intuitive knowledge for improving operations. Keywords Data mining Operation pattern Time-series data Building energy efficiency Data availability Data will be made available on request. 1 Introduction 1.1 Background The building community has been realizing the huge potential value of building performance data. This phenomenon stimulates the collection of massive building performance data. Table 1 illustrates a general classification of the levels of accessibility of building performance data. Tier 1 is much easier collected than type 2 which is easier acquired than type 3. Data in existing building performance datasets that mainly came from building energy certificates and benchmarking are largely in the tier 1 level. A sophisticated dataset, i.e., the commercial building energy consumption survey (CBECS) only contains general information on heating, cooling, envelopes, and operations [1]. The releases of building performance datasets have stimulated the research and application of data-driven building energy analysis. Data-driven methods have been applied to quantify the impacts of features on building energy consumption [2]. High-level building data can be used to unveil better operation strategies for improving thermal, economic, and comfort performance. However, data handling and interpretation of high-intensive energy data become increasingly complex [3]. 1.2 Motivation Building managers have the responsibility for the normal work of building facilities and minimizing the complaint of consumers. They are considered to take more responsibility for the sustainability of buildings [4]. However, on-site surveys showed that building managers lack enough knowledge, technology, and authorization to improve building energy performance [5,6], or conduct detailed energy simulations [7]. From the technique perspective, building management teams can hardly understand the fluctuant data collected by smart metering and the internet of things (IoT). The operation patterns can provide intensive information about operation efficiency [8]. However, current time-series energy data usually lack basic annotations and labels which makes it difficult to read and search. The operations of lighting, plugin devices, and the thermostat have the characteristics of dispersity and huge variations in time and spatial dimensions. It is also unlikely that they can figure out energy-efficient strategies. There is a strong need of mining intuitive knowledge from the time-series energy data [9]. The mismatch between the requirements of people and the operation of HVAC systems may cause unnecessary energy consumption [10,11]. Field studies of lighting use patterns found that people tend to turn on the lighting as the first arrival in the morning and automatic dimming devices can reduce lighting energy consumption [12]. By visiting 15 schools across the UK, Demanuele et al. [13] conducted a sensitivity analysis to find key factors that affect building energy and found that operational issues tremendously influence energy consumption. Compared with finding operation patterns by voting and questionnaire, data mining has obvious advantages in saving time, labor, and capital. 1.3 Related works Mining operation patterns from time-series data have been explored by many studies as summarized in Table 2 . Mining controls of HVAC is one of the major applications of previous studies [14\u201318]. Ruiz et al. [19] applied clustering algorithms, i.e., K-means, to group the time-series data of a building and analyzed the energy periodicity on the time-series data of eight university buildings. Bode et al. [20] analyzed the time-series data of building automation and control systems with several clustering methods. Unsupervised learning, including clustering and statistical algorithms, always serves as a basic method for handling time-series data [21,22]. These techniques manipulate all kinds of time-series data, labeled and unlabeled. However, understanding a large piece of mined information is still a challenge, because the information may not have any physical meaning [23]. Supervised learning is always deployed to predict energy consumption in the near short period. Reviews of energy forecasting on time-series data can be found in [24]. From building managers\u2019 perspective, they want to know where and when the low-efficient operations occur, and what actions they can take, rather than a bunch of tedious information. High-quality data are the foundation of successful data-driven analysis. However, a large proportion of previous models were carried out on the time-series data of a single building [8,11,12,15\u201318,20,22,25\u201330] or two buildings [21]. In other words, the reliability and applicability of those models and mined knowledge are doubtful. Note that it is difficult to extrapolate wisdom and knowledge mined from a single building [31]. 1.4 Research aims The human brain is basically a pattern cognitive machine [32]. We can hardly summarize long-term time-series data into an indicator. If the overall energy performance is low as shown by the energy utility intensity (EUI) or the benchmarking results, building managers are interested in exploring the potential reasons. However, they lack smart tools that can help them identify deep reasons. The facility and HVAC operation hours can provide building management teams with intuitive knowledge of the building they operated. Although several studies have pointed out that human behavior information can improve the performance of machine learning (ML) models in predicting building energy [33,34], a comparison of models built with and without operation information needs further research. Exploring the impacts of operational KPIs on energy consumption with the data of hundreds of buildings is also an interesting topic. The main objective of this study is to propose effective methods for mining operation hours of office buildings with the time-series data of hundreds of buildings. The contributions of this study can be summarized as follows: \u2022 Three methods are proposed for mining operation hours from time-series data. \u2022 A KPI of facility hours is proposed to indicate the existence of extra operation hours of facilities. \u2022 The impacts of proposed operational KPIs on energy consumption are invested by two data-driven methods, i.e., correlation analysis and EUI regression. The remaining parts of this paper are organized as follows. In the next section, the research methodology is presented emphasizing the proposition and evaluation of methods of mining operation hours. Section 3 describes the results. A focused discussion is carried out on several prevalent topics related to this study. The conclusions are drawn in the final section. 2 Methodology To mine operation hours and invest in the impacts of operational KPIs, the methodology of this study is elaborated in Fig. 1 . Firstly, the patterns of time-series electricity of office buildings are explored with clustering learning. Secondly, based on uncovered patterns, this study proposes three methods of mining the operation hours that are evaluated with manually annotated labels. A KPI is proposed to indicate unnecessary operations of facilities. Thirdly, the proposed methods are implemented on several case buildings for identifying unnecessary operation hours and predicting potential energy savings. Finally, operational suggestions are recommended based on the research results for building managers. 2.1 Data and preprocessing 2.1.1 Basic information about the datasets The datasets utilized to drive the data-driven analysis come from the building data genome 2 (BDG2) [39]. It has three datasets, i.e., the metering dataset, the weather dataset, and the meta-dataset. The metering datasets contain the hourly energy data of 1636 non-residential buildings in which there are 254 office buildings. After removing buildings with bad data (e.g., constant values for long time periods), there is a total of 240 valid office buildings. Except for the hourly electricity data, the hourly chilled water or hot water data are also available for some buildings. By default, there are four features in the meta-dataset, i.e., year of built, area, floors, and primary uses. Several other features, including heating degree days (HDD), cooling degree days (CDD), chilled water used, steam used, and hot water used, are mined from the other datasets. In our previous study, six operational KPIs are mined from the time-series data as shown in Table 3 . 2.1.2 Clustering learning on time-series data Usually, as for office buildings, the electricity would increase around the beginning of a workday and decrease around the end of the workday. The clustering analysis aims at exploring patterns of the time-series data. We conducted the clustering analysis of the metering data of four workdays in July with the Dynamic Time Warping Barycenter Averaging (DBA) k-means. The Elbow method is used to find the optimum number of clusters represented as \u2018k\u2019. The results show that the optimal number of clusters is about 7. We also found that when k is between 3 and 7, the top 2 clusters have obvious shapes and contain more than half of the data. Since we just want to find out the general obvious patterns of time-series data, two obvious patterns (cluster 1 and cluster 2) and the remaining data (cluster 3) are plotted in Fig. 2 . Members in cluster 1 mimic a sinusoidal wave as centroid shows. The centroid of cluster 2 has deep upward or downward characteristics that are akin to continuous steep mountains. While time-series data in cluster 3 do not follow an obvious pattern. 2.2 Methods of mining operation hours 2.2.1 Mining methods As for buildings in cluster 1, we can observe a steep upward and downward trend which can be detected by the gradients of the curves. However, this pattern does not exist for buildings in cluster 2 where each curve has many hills. Based on the patterns of time-series data, we propose three methods to mine the operation hours as described in Table 4 . 2.2.2 Operation hours Facility hours are the servicing hours of the building. Heating hours are the average operation hours of heating equipment in the winter. Cooling hours are the average operation hours of cooling equipment in the summer. The mining strategies of these operation hours are summarized in Table 5 . Fig. 4 shows the hourly electricity data of a building of a week in August. With the above-proposed methods, the operation hours of this building are mined as shown in Table 6 . 2.2.3 KPIs of facility hours If the performance of a building was low, the building management team would like to know the extent of the extra hours. Eq. (1) defines the energy performance indicator (EPI) of facility hours, where H F H is the facility hours, and H W H is the work hours. This EPI can give building managers first-hand data on the building. However, they cannot conclude whether the facility hours of the building are too long. The KPI of facility hours of a building is evaluated by comparing it with its peer buildings. The rank percentile serves as a good indicator of performance. To follow the mechanism of KPI (i.e., the bigger value is better than the smaller value), the KPI of operation hours is defined as the ranking percentile of E P I F H . Eq. 1 E P I F H = 1 − ( H F H − H W H ) 8 2.3 Evaluation of proposed methods This study evaluates the proposed methods by comparing the mined results with the annotated labels. Annotation is a process of adding information about a specific event by observing the time-series data. In this study, each participant would check the hourly electricity data based on which determine the beginning and end of the facility hours. First, all participants are trained with the hourly energy data of a building whose operation hours are known. Secondly, the program randomly selects 6 buildings for each participant. We insert two default buildings for all participants which are used to avoid obvious errors. Finally, the mining hours and annotated results of selected buildings are compared using the coefficient of determination (R2) and Kullback-Leibler (K-L) divergence as the criteria. The schematic method of evaluating the data-mining method is shown in Fig. 5 . 6 graduated students participated in this experiment. These participants are requested to mark the facility hours of each workday in July. 2.4 The impacts of operational KPIs If the operational KPIs are important parameters of building energy efficiency, they shall have a profound impact on energy consumption. Here, we want to evaluate the impacts of operation patterns on the EUI. 2.4.1 With correlation coefficients The correlation coefficient measures the linear relationship between pair-wise continuous variables. In this study, we want to explore the correlation between operational KPIs and the EUI. The correlation coefficient is a commonly used statistical method in this field. 2.4.2 On EUI prediction EUI prediction is a fundamental work in this field. Significant research has been done to predict EUI with ML which are categorized as black-box models. It is difficult to predict EUI with those four features in BDG2. If mined KPIs are good indicators of energy consumption, they shall improve the EUI prediction accuracy. To test this idea, this study builds two types of regression models, i.e., with and without KPIs. Ensemble learning algorithms, including random forest and gradient boosting, which can achieve higher accuracy than traditional models such as decision trees, are adopted to carry out the study [33,40]. This study adopts the coefficient of determination (R2) and mean absolute error (MAE) to weigh the performance of different ML models. One of the reasons that R2 and MAE are used is that they are widely used in similar studies of EUI regression. So, it is convenient to compare the prediction accuracy with results achieved by other studies. For another reason, R2 does not have much relation with the unit and the ranges of the EUI. 2.4.3 With SHAP values Unlike physical models, the explanation of black-box models is an important work for advanced ML models. In this study, the SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations) method [41] is deployed to evaluate the impacts of operation hours on the outputs of ML models. Traditional ML strategies, including data preprocessing, feature selection, and hyper-parameter tuning, are used in building the supervised models. During the preprocessing, the Pearson Correlation Coefficients of operational KPIs and EUI are calculated to unveil their impacts on EUI. 2.5 Case studies Once building managers got the information that the building has unnecessary operation hours, they would like to take some measures to reduce facility hours. Because the BDG2 datasets lack the occupancy and HVAC operational data. To test the proposed methods and the impacts of reducing unnecessary facility hours, this study carries out case studies on three ASHRAE prototype buildings with detailed energy simulation. The prototype models of ASHRAE were developed to simulate the energy impact of ASHRAE standard 90.1 [42]. Fig. 6 shows the energy models of three office buildings. The simulations are fulfilled by EnergyPlus 9.0, a widely accepted energy modeling software [43]. Some basic information about office buildings is shown in Table 7 . It is supposed that these buildings locate in Shanghai which has a hot-summer-cold-winter climate. The strategy of reduction of facility hours is to cut the cooling, lighting, and equipment hours, but above the basic requirements of occupants. We want to know the energy-saving potential of reduced facility hours. 3 Results 3.1 Basic statistics of operation hours Table 8 lists the statistical information of facility hours mined by three proposed methods. The results show that on average, the hours mined by the dual-gradient method are higher than by the other two methods. The median facility hours of office buildings are 10.62 and 10.41 h in summer and winter mined by the cumulative method which are litter higher than the traditional legislated 9 h. Fig. 7 paints the distributions of facility hours in winter and summer by three methods. The distributions of facility hours mined by the cumulative histogram method are thinner than the distributions mined by the other two methods. 3.2 Comparison between mined and annotated results There are 48 pieces of labeled facility hours for the workdays of July. Table 9 demonstrates the R2 values and K-L divergences between annotated labels and mined facility hours. Both metrics unveil that the cumulative method performs better results. Fig. 8 shows the distributions of annotated and mined facility hours. If the mined results are the same with annotated values, scattered points shall spread on the backslashes from bottom left to top right. The facility hours mined by the dual-gradient method are usually smaller than annotated labels. 3.3 Impacts of operational KPIs on EUI 3.3.1 Correlation coefficient Each of operational KPI has two variations for different seasons, usually the summer and winter. Table 10 lists the Pearson correlation coefficients between operational KPIs and the EUI. KPIs of facility hours are the evaluation results by the cumulative histogram method. We can observe that KPI for weekends during winter (KPIW,W) ranks the highest, followed by KPI of weekends during summer (KPIW,S) and HDD. It turns out that the KPIs of facility hours do not have profound influence on energy consumption. Table 11 lists the correlation coefficients between pairs of operational KPIs. It can be observed that KPIs of facility hours have a negative correlation with the KPI of non-working hours, which follows the idea that if a building has a long facility hour, it consumes less energy during nonworking hours. The KPIs of transition seasons have little correlation with the KPIs of facility hours. 3.3.2 EUI prediction Table 12 demonstrates the prediction accuracy of EUI regression with and without KPIs as features by two ensemble learning models. The best results are achieved by the random forest model with KPIs as additional features where the prediction accuracy (R2) increases from 0.35 to 0.41. The random forest models have slightly better performance on training set than on testing set. Moreover, the variances are quite low which testify the random forest models are robust and faraway from overfitting. The results showed that mined KPIs can improve the prediction accuracy of EUI. 3.3.3 SHAP impacts on EUI Fig. 9 (a) shows the impacts of different features on the outcomes of random forest models. The results show that the KPI of weekends in winter (KPIW,W) has the largest influence, the same as the correlation coefficient results. In addition, we can observe that HDD has strong influence on the EUI which may because the data size is relatively small, but buildings have huge diverse weather conditions. To overcome the impacts of HDD and CDD, weather normalized EUI (EUI_WN) is reset as the regression objective. Fig. 9(b) shows the impacts of features on EUI_WN regression. Because weather normalized EUI is much smaller than the original EUI, the mean impacts of features are also much smaller. From Fig. 9 (b), KPIW,W ranks the highest, followed by KPIT,A. Because KPIW,W has a strong correlation with KPIN,S, KPIN,W, and KPIW,S, when building a EUI regression model, KPIW,W may has weaken the impacts of other similar features. 3.4 Energy savings of reduced facility hours on case buildings Tables 13 and 14 shows the performance of case buildings before and after reducing the facility hours. The occupant hours are the hours of occupant rate above 0.95 which comes from schedules of energy models. The reduced facility hours mainly come from the reduction of cooling hours. The facility hours are reduced range from 0.5 to 3.0 h. With the reduction of facility hours, the energy consumption is reduced range from 2.88% to 10.6%. 4 Discussion 4.1 Operational KPIs This field lacks enough readable KPIs for building managers who take charge of the operations of buildings. The operational KPIs are to identify low-performance operations in time and sub-system dimensions [9]. Previous studies have predicted time-varying human behavior with ML algorithms [44], but have not summarized long-term information into a single KPI. The KPI of facility hours proposed in this study is an important supplement to existing KPIs. Traditionally, only main features, such as area, activity, heating equipment, and HDD, are collected for energy certificates and benchmarking. Operational features are rare in current energy performance datasets. For example, the occupancy rate is the only operational feature of the energy benchmarking data of Singapore [45]. Scientists have built several datasets for benchmarking the performance of fault detection models [46]. There is still a lack of standard datasets for mining building operations. 4.2 The accuracy of EUI regression The mined operational KPIs have improved the regression prediction accuracy. As summarized in [47], seldom regression studies can reach the accuracy of 0.5 with R2 as the criterion. Existing open-accessible building performance datasets, such as the well-known CBECS, have few features relating to operation and maintenance. EUI regression models on those datasets cannot achieve desirable results. For example, Deng et al. [33]compared six famous ML algorithms in predicting EUI. Even though ensemble learning models achieved better results, the overall R2 values are smaller than 0.3. Human behavior information can provide an extra role in energy prediction. For instance, Lin et al. [34] have achieved an adjusted R2 value of 0.526 with maintenance/operation information used in predicting EUI. 4.3 Operation suggestions Economic feasibility, occupant impact, and technical practicality are three major concerns of facility managers for making decisions for energy efficiency [29]. This study has demonstrated that operations on weekends in winter tremendously influence energy consumption which may be because employees use electric heaters for heating. While the energy efficiency of electric heaters is much lower than heat pumps. If building managers found that the KPI of weekends in winter of the office is quite low, they can adopt energy-efficient measures to reduce energy consumption. Usually, the closure of unnecessary electrical equipment will not impact occupant comfort. The knowledge found in this study can provide facility managers with an obvious direction for improving building energy efficiency. 5 Conclusion and future considerations Adding readable and searchable attributes of time-series data is an important direction for promoting the value of these data. This study proposed three methods for mining operation hours from time-series energy data. The proposed methods were evaluated by comparing the mined hours with annotated hours. The results showed the accumulative histogram method is a preferable solution for predicting the operation hours. The correlation analysis showed that the facility hours have some, but not significant impact on energy consumption. The EUI regression results indicate that mined operational features can improve the prediction accuracy (R2 values were improved from 0.35 to 0.41). Out of several operational KPIs, the KPI of weekends has the highest impact on energy consumption. The case study showed that reducing unnecessary facility hours can save much energy. One major contribution of this study is the verification of the value of mined operational KPIs which can help building managers to find operational measures for energy-saving. Many more operational KPIs related to human behavior, operation, and maintenance can be mined from various time-series data, for example, the air temperature setpoints. What's more, on-site case studies should be conducted to test the practicability of mined operational KPIs.

Mining operation patterns from time-series data have huge potential to provide extra information for improving energy efficiency. Previous studies mainly focused on mining control patterns of the heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning system (HVAC). Mining operational patterns from time-series data can help building managers identify energy-wasting operations. This study proposes three methods of mining the operation hours on the time-series data of hundreds of buildings. A key performance indicator (KPI) of facility hours is proposed to indicate the discrepancy between occupants\u2019 requirements and facility hours. The study is carried out on the 240 office buildings of building data genome project 2 (BDG2). The proposed methods are evaluated by comparing mined hours with annotated hours. The impacts of eight operational KPIs are quantified with correlation coefficients and ensemble learning. The practicality of the proposed methods is evaluated on three case buildings. The results show that the cumulative histogram method is effective in mining operation hours. The regression results indicate that mined KPIs can improve the energy prediction accuracy (R2) from 0.35 to 0.41. The impacts of operational KPIs reveal that the KPI of weekends has a tremendous impact on energy consumption. The case study results show that reducing unnecessary facility hours can save from 2.9% to 10.6% energy. This study verifies that operational KPIs mined from time-series data can provide building managers with intuitive knowledge for improving operations.",
