Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) has become an emerging technology in the energy sector for its effectiveness in the energy disaggregation of individual loads from the measured aggregated energy in main power supply of building. NILM has also evolved gradually over the past few decades, due to the significant advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), embedded/edge devices, and internet of things (IoT). From the review of literature, we observed that most of the NILM systems were only capable of monitoring different loads and it fails to detect and disaggregate the energy consumption of similar loads effectively. Further, most of works in the literature were focused on improving the performance of energy disaggregation of different loads in residential buildings and very limited works have been carried out for the similar loads in NILM system. Therefore, there is a necessity to study and evaluate the state of the art NILM algorithms for similar loads in real case scenarios for effective implementation in the commercial and industrial buildings. In this paper, we present a case study of the developed DeepEdge-NILM device which has been installed in a commercial building (office environment), where multiple similar and identical air conditioners (AC's) are used in the monitoring environment. A deep learning framework, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) has been implemented on the new set of features which comprises of electrical features and intrinsic features derived from the basic electric features using geometric mean for capturing the signature of similar loads effectively. From our case study, we observed that the performance of the deployed NILM system outperforms the baseline systems that have been developed using basic electrical features significantly. Finally, the limitations and future scope of the NILM edge device in the commercial buildings are also discussed.

AI helps in dealing with big data from various data sources/monitoring environments for supporting decision making, forecasting future possible events and providing recommendations in many applications towards the smart sustainable cities development. It has been reported that more than half of the people in the world lives in cities. Therefore, cities are accountable for 70% of global carbon emissions and 60-80% of energy consumption [1]. The responsible use of energy resources, conserving the energy consumption as well as the environment, and improving the well-being of the societies are the major objectives for the development of smart sustainable cities [1]. Energy management plays an important role in utilizing and optimizing the available energy resources. The recent advancements in the smart metering, smart grid and internet of things (IoT) have improved the energy management strategies significantly [1]. Buildings across the cities contribute to the large energy consumption. Since the energy demand in the building sector increases gradually, optimal energy usage strategy need to be developed for effective energy management in commercial and residential buildings. Conventional approaches use the whole building energy consumption in real time and send back to the consumers at user defined intervals or continuously. The real-time energy consumption feedback to the consumers using conventional approaches could save around 9% of total energy consumption [2]. However, these approaches have not much impacted the energy usage behavior of the consumers due to insufficient details about the electrical utilities that are being used in the buildings [3]. Therefore, load/appliance level energy monitoring is required to understand the energy usage behavior of the consumers. However, this approach would require sensors for each load which would be expensive and may not be feasible in commercial and residential buildings. Therefore, Hart et al., [4] introduced non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) approach to monitor electrical utilities from the aggregated energy measured from the entry point of the building. NILM aims to detect the load events and disaggregate individual load energy consumption from the aggregated energy for the given time instances [5]. The signatures of the loads are captured through feature extraction from the measured electrical signals during transient and steady state operation of loads [6]. The extracted features are fed to the machine learning and deep learning algorithms for the load classification and energy disaggregation [7\u201310]. Further, efforts are being taken to address several challenges such as lack of ground-truth data, variability in appliance power consumption patterns, and the need for privacy-preserving approaches [11]. NILM also has significant potential applications in the energy sectors such as anomaly detection, load forecasting, distributed energy resources (DER), smart grid, and ambient assistant living (AAL) [10,12]. 1.1 Related works Generally, NILM has the tasks of load identification and energy disaggregation in the monitoring environment. The load identification involves only the detection of events (on/off) based on the aggregated electrical signals. However, energy disaggregation aims to estimate the individual energy consumption of loads from the aggregated energy. Therefore, researchers have explored these two tasks either separately or together based on their focus of the research problem. However, effective energy disaggregation would automatically lead to identify the load status as well as the energy consumption of the respective loads. The load identification and energy disaggregation can be carried out using classification and regression algorithms respectively in a supervised or unsupervised learning approaches [10]. Feature extraction plays a significant role in capturing signature of loads. Generally, real power (P) and reactive power (Q) are used for load identification and energy disaggregation [13,14]. The features can be extracted during the steady and transient state operation of loads in the time, frequency, and time-frequency domains respectively [15\u201317]. The transient state features require higher sampling rate of electrical signals to capture the load signature effectively. From the NILM literature, it is observed that the features such as active power, reactive power, apparent power, voltage and current effective values (RMS), power factor, odd harmonic current components, harmonic distortion of voltage and current, VI trajectory, load behavior information (statistical features of power values) are used in various NILM systems [18]. Recently, Souza et al. explored IEEE 1459 standard power theory and the conservative power theory (CPT) for NILM systems [18]. The IEEE 1459 standard power theory is a widely used power theory that defines four types of power: active power, reactive power, apparent power, and complex power. CPT is a newer power theory that defines two types of power: conservative power and non-conservative power. The authors argue that CPT features are more informative than IEEE 1459 standard power features for NILM applications since the CPT features take into account the non-sinusoidal nature of power consumption, which is a common occurrence in household appliances. The CPT features such as void power, void current, apparent current, active current, reactive current, reactivity factor and distortion factor are explored for improving NILM systems [18]. Kang et al. fused multiple feature sets to improve the NILM performance, adaptively adjusting the feature weight based on their importance [19]. The features such as time domain features (mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis, and total harmonic distortion), frequency domain features (amplitude and phase of harmonics, power spectrum density, and discrete Fourier transform coefficients), and statistical features (autocorrelation function, power, and wavelet transform coefficients) are used [19]. Feng et al. introduced a multichannel spatio-temporal feature fusion method for NILM which involves fusing spatial and temporal features from multiple channels, including voltage, current, and power channels [20]. The technique is evaluated on real-world datasets, and it is found to be effective in achieving higher accuracy in NILM compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Dowalla et al. combined signal processing techniques, such as cross-correlation, auto-correlation, and Fourier analysis, to identify the signature waveform of each appliance [21]. Xia et al. proposes a method for feature extraction in load monitoring using time-frequency analysis-based transient harmonic features. The approach involves using wavelet transform to extract transient harmonics from the power signal and constructing a feature matrix based on the extracted features [22]. These features help to detect up to six devices when they are operated simultaneously. The proposed approach has been tested on the Controlled On/Off Loads Library and Home Equipment Laboratory datasets [22]. Dash et al. also utilized low frequency energy data acquired from the smart meter to detect loads simultaneously using the time domain features such as voltage, current, active power, reactive power, and statistical features, mean, variance, and skewness of the power signals [23]. The proposed system uses attention based multi task probabilistic network (AMTPN) for load detection and energy disaggregation tasks [23]. Yin et al. used a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) for simultaneous detection and classification of multiple appliances [24]. The proposed method uses a load trajectory-based approach along with a multi-feature extraction technique to capture both the steady-state and transient characteristics of the appliances. Statistical and frequency-domain features, such as mean, variance, power spectral density, and total harmonic distortion, and load trajectory feature are used for simultaneous detection of loads in NILM system [24]. Drouaz et al., [25] used stockwell transform to extract the features from the current transient signals in the time-frequency domain. The reported approach has outperformed the state of the art systems for load classification [25]. In another study, symmetrical component transform has been used to extract transient features and identify individual appliances and estimate their power consumption. The proposed approach outperforms traditional NILM methods [26]. Ghaffar et al. analyzed frequency spectrum of power consumption data to detect individual appliances using spectral clustering [27]. The technique is evaluated on real-world datasets and is found to be effective in identifying appliance-level usage accurately. Similarly, Birch clustering and watchdog timers are also used detect the loads and disaggregate the energy consumption respectively [28]. These approaches are evaluated on real world datasets and found to effective in NILM systems. Event detection and thresholding methods are also used to detect and energy disaggregation of loads effectively [29\u201331]. Schirmer et al., [32] extracted a 2-D low frequency PQ signatures in the time and frequency domains from the aggregated data and then modeled it using convolution neural networks (CNN) for disaggregating the energy. The 2-D based PQ signatures marginally outperform the previously reported approaches [32]. Recently, a double Fourier integral analysis based CNN regression model has been developed using the raw current and voltage signals sampled at higher rates [33]. The proposed approach improves the energy disaggregation accuracy over the other approaches such as voltage and current spectrograms, and other CNN architectures [33]. Similarly, various deep learning architectures such as long-short term memory (LSTM) [34\u201336], CNN-LSTM [37] and variational autoencoders [38] have been used for improving the performance of load identification and energy disaggregation. Sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) learning approach has been explored in NILM that uses a deep recurrent neural network (RNN) to map the input power signal to the output appliance-level consumption. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art NILM methods on multiple benchmark datasets and can handle variable-length input sequences [39]. A new framework for NILM based on the conditional diffusion model has been introduced which utilizes a combination of diffusion processes and deep neural networks to accurately disaggregate electricity consumption data [40]. A deep adaptive ensemble filter (DAEF) has been proposed for NILM that can handle missing or corrupted data and adaptively update its parameters in real-time. The proposed method leverages the strengths of both deep neural networks and ensemble filters to improve disaggregation accuracy [41]. Transfer learning approaches are also explored improving the NILM systems. NILM using transfer learning involves leveraging knowledge from pre-trained neural networks for feature extraction and transferring it to a new model for improved accuracy and efficiency. This approach has shown promising results in both traditional and multi-objective NILM applications [42,43]. Numerous deep learning methods have been proposed in the literature to tackle the issue of non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) with promising results. However, these models often underperform in new environments and lack flexibility, making them difficult to scale without large, labeled datasets. The constantly changing nature of appliance ownership and usage further exacerbates this problem, requiring extensive training data. While transfer learning is a popular approach to address this issue, it assumes the availability of high-quality labeled data from the new environment. To overcome these challenges, an active learning framework has been introduced for NILM that can update deep learning models with minimal amounts of data, making them transferable to new environments [44]. Sykiotis et al. presented a transformer-based architecture named ELECTRIcity for NILM [45]. Unlike recurrent models, this approach solely relies on attention mechanisms to extract global dependencies between the aggregate and the domestic appliance signals [45]. Similarly, a NILM system also proposed that utilizes self-attention mechanisms to amplify the influence of critical features in the disaggregation process [46]. Angelis et al. introduced a new transformer-based model for energy disaggregation that leverages the inherent hierarchical structure of household electricity consumption data to improve disaggregation accuracy [47]. Yin et al. experimented attention convolution neural network (ACNN) which utilizes a multi-level attention mechanism to focus on specific parts of the incremental voltage-current representations (IVCR) representation and learn to effectively separate the contribution of different appliances to the overall power consumption [48]. Yu et al. presented a novel approach to energy disaggregation using a siamese network, which learns to identify the unique features of individual appliances in order to accurately disaggregate energy consumption [49]. Recently, graph signal processing has attracted researchers to explore in the NILM problem. Zhao et al. proposed an unsupervised approach for NILM based on graph signal processing [50]. They model the power sequences as signals on a graph, where the nodes represent appliances and the edges represent correlations between them and then graph signal processing technique has been applied to separate the power sequences into individual appliance contributions. The proposed approach outperforms existing unsupervised NILM methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency [50]. Similarly, Jiao et al. presented graph neural networks (GNNs) [51]. GNNs with novel attention mechanism has been used to model the relationships between appliances in a household and predict their power consumption. The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets for NILM [51]. Optimization based approaches are also explored to improve the performance of NILM systems. Sykiotis et al. experimented with performance-aware optimization approach for NILM models intended for deployment on edge devices. The approach involves optimizing the NILM model to achieve the desired accuracy while minimizing the computational and memory requirements [52]. Similarly, mixed-integer programming approach has been used for industrial non-intrusive load monitoring for improving the NILM systems [53]. Bousbiat et al. discussed the automation, hyperparameters, and modular pipelines in neural NILM [54]. The paper also highlights the importance of automating the NILM pipeline to reduce human intervention, optimizing hyperparameters to improve NILM performance, and designing modular pipelines to enable the easy integration of new approaches and models. Though these algorithms improve the performance of the NILM systems, the loads used in the electrical network are mostly different loads which is common in the residential buildings. However, there are scenarios, where multiple similar loads (e.g., air conditioners, computers, lights, fans etc) are used in the commercial buildings. In these scenarios, the performance of the NILM device may not be accurate due to overlapping signatures of similar loads. Few attempts have been made to distinguish multiple Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFL) which are having same technical specifications [55\u201357]. A feature mapping based deep neural networks have been explored to effectively distinguish the similar loads [57\u201359]. However, the reported approach is experimented only for the load identification and not experimented on energy disaggregation. From the review of literature, it is noted that most of the NILM works are more focused on residential buildings where use of different loads is common and very limited works have been carried out for monitoring similar loads where the use of similar loads is common in commercial buildings. Recently, Meier et al., [60] carried out a case study of NILM in commercial buildings and reported its practical limits. The report reveals that the NILM has largely failed to disaggregate the loads due to several similar loads in the commercial buildings [60]. Therefore, to overcome these limitations, effective methodologies need to be developed for energy disaggregation of similar loads. In this work, we considered multiple similar loads, air conditioners that are to be monitored using NILM in an office environment in the commercial building. The air conditioners are selected for this case study because of its high power consumption and it is used in large quantities in commercial buildings. The major contributions of this paper are: \u2022 An in-house NILM edge device/instrument has been developed for monitoring the loads from the main power supply of the building. The developed device is capable to collect, process, compute, and perform decision making of the electrical signals. \u2022 A new feature set has been introduced to capture the signature of similar loads. The new feature set has been developed by fusing the electrical features and intrinsic features that are derived from the electrical features using geometric mean. The geometric mean based fused feature set (GM-FFS) fed LSTM deep neural network captures the signatures of the similar loads effectively and improves the performance of energy disaggregation significantly when compared to the baseline systems. \u2022 The proposed NILM algorithm has been implemented in the developed NILM edge device and tested it successfully for monitoring multiple similar air conditioners in an office environment in the commercial building as a case study. To the best of our knowledge, a case study of an in-house NILM edge device with the new feature set, GM-FFS based LSTM network for the multiple similar air conditioners (similar loads) in the commercial building has never been explored in the literature. The details of the experimental design and deployment, methodology, experimental results are discussed in the following Sections, 2, 3 and 4 respectively. The limitations and future scope of the work have been illustrated in Section 5. The Section 6 concludes this paper. 2 Experimental design and deployment In this work, a commercial building (office environment) has been considered for the case study. Electrical loads such as air conditioners, lights, and other computer devices are being used in the environment. In this work, we focus on the air conditioners (AC's) which would lead to high energy consumption. Multiple air conditioners (AC's) are distributed across R and Y phases of the power supply. Some of the air conditioners in the monitoring environment are identical and similar power rated. Table 1 lists the loads connected to the R and Y phases. The developed NILM edge device is named as \u2018e-Sense\u2019 which has been connected to the main phases of the power supply. The photograph of the developed NILM edge device and its components are shown in the Fig. 1 and 2 respectively. Each phase current signal has been measured through clamp CT's and then output of the current sensors are connected to the e-Sense. For training purpose, separate clamp CT's are connected to each air conditioners through the data acquisition system which acquires and processes the data from each load and then transfers electrical signals to the remote server using wireless protocol IEEE802.11b/g/n. The Fig. 3 illustrates the main panel of the commercial building and the individual sensor and data acquisition device connected for each load. The e-sense comprises of signal conditioning unit, energy IC (Microchip ATM90E36A), a low cost high speed controller, ESP32S2, mini-PC (Odyssey \u2013 X86J4105864 board with 8 GB RAM, 64 GB storage and Ardinuo Co-processor Onboard) and other power modules to perform various operations which include collect, process, compute, and decision making of the incoming three phase voltage and current signals. Table 2 lists the design parameters of the e-Sense. As per the design specifications in Table 2, the printed circuit board (PCB) has been designed using EasyEDA PCB design tool. The energy IC has the analog to digital (ADC) converter which samples the incoming three phase voltage and current signals at 8 kHz sampling frequency. For each measurement cycle, ADC provides 160 samples. Therefore, the grid frequency of 50 Hz, 8000 (50 cycles*160) samples are acquired from the ADC. For every measurement cycle, electrical parameters such as Vrms, Irms, frequency, real power, reactive power, apparent power, and power factor are calculated from the input voltage and current signals using the energy IC. It is to be noted that the energy IC has the ability to extract electrical quantities continuously regardless of whether the signal is transient or steady state. Therefore, in this work, all the features extracted from the NILM device have the information about the transient state as well as the steady state operation of the loads continuously. Since this edge device is deployed in the monitoring environment, the samples are continuously acquired and processed. The extracted features are transferred to microcontroller using the SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) communication protocol. An UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) is used between the microcontroller ESP32 and edge device, mini-PC for sending the signals from ESP32 to mini-PC for processing and computations. The UART is an integrated chip (IC) through which the communication over a computer or peripheral device serial port is carried out. The electrical signals are monitored and recorded continuously from the individual loads and main power supply for this case study. However, the data from individual loads are used only during the training phase for learning the signature and validation during the testing phase. The loads are monitored through a web application based user interface. The time series data acquired through the developed edge device has been split sequentially in 80:20 (timestamp wise) to ensure that the model is trained on past data and tested on more recent or future observations, which aligns with the temporal nature of the data. The total number of data samples, 3,15,968 having sequential timestamp information, the data has been split into first 2,52,774 samples for training and remaining 63,194 samples for testing the energy disaggregation algorithms for similar loads. In this work, we developed the NILM edge device which is capable of connecting the loads from three phases with the range of voltage 0-400 V per phase and current 0-200 A per phase. In this case study, we have used 4 air conditioners in R phase and 3 air conditioners in Y phase. However, since the maximum current rating per phase is 200 A, we can connect multiple loads within its range and detect them simultaneously. For example, the air conditioner (2 Ton) maximum rating is 15 A. If we would like to connect multiple 2 Ton AC in one of the phases, the hardware is capable of monitoring and detecting loads up to 13 AC's per phase. Similarly, the other two phases can be utilized for monitoring various combinations of loads in commercial building within the range of 200 A of total current rating of loads per phase. The measured signals such as current, real power, and reactive power from the R and Y phases are represented through box plots in Fig. 4 to understand the distribution of the data samples of the loads. Fig. 5 illustrates the functional overview of the developed NILM edge device. Fig. 6 represents aggregated real power consumption of R and Y phases for a particular time period in the commercial building. Similarly, real power consumption of the individual loads connected to the R and Y phases for the particular time period is illustrated in Fig. 7 and 8 respectively. Further, the performance of the developed edge device has been tested through the calibration device, CALSOURCE 200 which is a standard source for calibration and testing the power and energy meters. The electrical parameters, voltage, current and power factor are set from calibration device which is given as a input to the edge device, and the corresponding energy parameters from the edge device will be measured. From our test results it is observed that the measured energy parameter is well comparable to the expected actual values within a tolerance range of Class 1 accuracy. The electronic components and IC used in the device have high quality industrial standards in terms of measurement accuracy and they are robust to harsh industrial environments. The performance test of the designed edge device is listed in Table 3 . 3 Methodology Most of the NILM systems were developed using the fundamental electrical parameters as features for energy disaggregation. The parameters such as real power and apparent power are widely used as the input and output features for estimating the energy consumption of loads. However, these features may not be sufficient to capture inherent characteristics of loads when multiple nearly identical or similar loads are monitored through NILM system. The energy disaggregation can be formulated as a regression problem. Given the aggregated energy from the main power supply as a input variable and corresponding individual loads energy consumption as target variables, energy disaggregation model can be developed using machine learning/deep learning algorithms. The aggregated energy measured at time t can be mathematically expressed as in Eq. (1): (1) x ( t ) = ∑ i = 0 N y i ( t ) , where N denotes number of loads in the building. y i ( t ) represents energy consumption of device i at time t ∈ { 1 , 2 , . . T } . Given the aggregated energy { x ( t ) } t = 1 T , the objective of the energy disaggregation algorithm is to estimate the energy consumption of each load, { y i ( t ) } t = 1 T for i ∈ { 1 , 2 , . . N } . In this work, supervised learning algorithm has been used for estimating the energy consumption. The data acquired from the main power supply (aggregated energy) and individual loads energy consumption are used for training the model. From the raw voltage and current signals, electrical and intrinsic features are extracted to capture the signature of the similar loads. 3.1 Geometric mean based fused feature set (GM-FFS) In this work, we experiment with multiple features as the input variables to capture the inherent characteristics of the individual loads. First we consider the real power (P), reactive power (Q), apparent power (S) and power factor (PF) as the baseline features. Fig. 9 illustrates the relationship between the basic electrical features. The mathematical relation for obtaining the baseline features, P, Q, and S are illustrated in Fig. 9. Further, we propose a new feature set by expanding the baseline features using geometric mean. Since each electrical parameters have some significant characteristics about the loads, we need to utilise the important electrical features for developing energy disaggregation systems. The feature set has been expanded by deriving new features using the geometric mean as expressed in Eq. (2). (2) G M = ( ∏ i = 1 n x i ) 1 n = x 1 x 2 x 3 . . . . x n n The geometric mean represents the n t h square root of product of the input features. Basically, it combines the features in a single measure that represents the overall relationship between the features. We derived new features by computing geometric mean (GM) between real power and reactive power ( G M P Q ), reactive power and apparent power ( G M Q S ), real power and current ( G M P I ), apparent power and current ( G M S I ), and real power, reactive power, and apparent power ( G M P Q S ). In the context of machine learning, geometric mean can be used as a feature to capture interactions between multiple variables. In the case of a regression model, the geometric mean can be calculated as the square root of the product of two variables. For example, if we have two variables P and Q, the geometric mean feature can be defined as: G M P Q = P i Q i 2 . This feature captures the interaction between P and Q and can be seen as a multiplicative interaction. The geometric mean captures a non-linear interaction between the variables and can be useful in situations where the relationship between the variables is non-linear. Therefore, the geometric mean can be seen as a type of interaction feature. Similarly, for G M P Q S = P i Q i S i 3 , the square root operation applied to the product of P, Q, and S captures a more complex relationship among the variables. This feature allows for the consideration of the overall magnitude or magnitude ratio between P and Q, as well as their combined contribution to S. Therefore, we utilized the geometric mean based fused feature set (GM-FFS) for improving the energy disaggregation of similar loads in NILM system. In this work, we explore the potential of the geometric mean based features for the electrical power quantities which captures the non-linear interaction between the electrical quantities which helps improve the energy disaggregation of similar loads. The derived geometric mean based new features listed in Eq. (3)-(8) are extracted using the baseline features, P, Q, and S. Geometric mean helps capture the intrinsic relationship between each electrical features. Using the Eq. (2), we can derive the geometric mean between the real power P and reactive power Q as expressed in Eq (3). The features P and Q are combined in a single measure which represents the overall relationship between them. (3) G M P Q = P i Q i 2 Similarly, the Q and S represents the overall relationship between the reactive power and apparent power in a single measure using Eq. (4). (4) G M Q S = Q i S i 2 The following Eq. (5) represents the overall relationship between the real power P and apparent power S in a single measure. (5) G M P S = P i S i 2 Similarly, the overall relationship between the real power P and current I, and apparent power S and current I are calculated using the Eq. (6) and Eq. (7) respectively. (6) G M P I = P i I i 2 (7) G M S I = S i I i 2 The overall relationship between the real power P, reactive power Q and apparent power S are computed using the geometric mean is expressed in Eq. (8): (8) G M P Q S = P i Q i S i 3 The basic feature set BF for the baseline system can be expressed as in Eq. (9): (9) B F = | P , Q , S , P F | The geometric mean features that are derived using basic features BF can be expressed as in Eq. (10): (10) G M F S = | G M P Q , G M Q S , G M P S , G M P I , G M S I , G M P Q S | The geometric mean based fused feature set (GM-FFS) can be obtained by combining the basic features BF and geometric mean features G M F S . The derived new feature set can be expressed as in Eq. (11). (11) G m f f s = | B F , G M F S | The GM-FFS is used as the input variables/features to capture the targeted individual load consumption. In this work, we used real power as a target feature which is to be disaggregated across different loads in the monitoring environment. The mapping of input GM-FFS features from the aggregated energy to the disaggregated energy (real power) of individual loads can be mathematically expressed as in Eq. (12) and (13): (12) G m f f s ↦ E d i s (13) | G m f f s 11 . . G m f f s n 1 . . . . . . . . G m f f s 1 t . . G m f f s n t | ↦ | E d i s l 1 . . E d i s l n . . . . . E d i s l t . . E d i s l t | In Eq. (13), G m f f s matrix represents the features of the GM-FFS, which consists of G m f f s 11 to G m f f s n 1 . The corresponding mapped matrix E d i s consists of the energy disaggregated values of the loads from E d i s l 1 to E d i s l n . In this work, ADC provides 160 samples for each measurement cycle. Therefore, the grid frequency of 50 Hz, 8000 (50 cycles*160) samples are acquired from the ADC. The GM-FFS features are extracted for each measurement cycle of the electrical signals. Therefore, extraction of one feature set includes all GM-FFS features for each cycle, and in total 50 feature sets are extracted per second for 50 cycles. Since this edge device is deployed in the monitoring environment, the samples are continuously acquired, and then GM-FFS features are extracted for each cycle of the electrical signals. 3.2 LSTM Long short-term memory (LSTM) is a type of recurrent neural networks (RNN) which has been used successfully for various applications including time series analysis [61]. LSTM overcomes the limitations of the basic type of RNN by tackling long time dependencies. LSTM structure has repeating cells and it uses the preceding cells output to fed in to subsequent LSTM cell and maintains hidden states. Therefore, LSTM predicts the current state based on the current input and the knowledge learnt from past. The Fig. 10 illustrates the graphical representation of LSTM chain/architecture and the representation of a single LSTM cell. The three gates in each LSTM cell help to bridge long temporal lags in the input data by forgetting old information or updating with new information in the LSTM network. In this work, G m f f s t is the geometric mean fused feature set for time t which is given as a input to LSTM cell. The G m f f s t is extracted from the raw signals for every second and then fed to the LSTM cell for learning the signatures of the loads. For the given input G m f f s at time t, along with the previous cell states C t − 1 , and h t − 1 , the input gate, output gate and forget gate are computed. The output gate provides the energy disaggregation E d i s t of the loads at time t. Subsequently, the LSTM cell provides the current cell state C t and hidden state h t information which will be used to process the next/future data samples that would be fed to LSTM cell. This process will be continued until the LSTM cell gets input aggregated GM-FFS based fused features G m f f s . The final output from the LSTM cell is then fed to the fully connected layers followed by the output layer of the network. The output layer provides the energy disaggregation of the loads for each phase. The Fig. 11 illustrates the block diagram representation of the proposed approach. 4 Experimental results As the major objective of this work is to improve the energy disaggregation accuracy of similar loads in commercial building, due to the fact that the similar loads affect the performance of the energy disaggregation for its overlapping signature, we would also like to show first the performance of the NILM system when different loads are connected in the electrical network for better understanding of the objectives of this work as well as the performance gap between the different loads and similar loads. As explained in Section 2, for all the experiments in this work, the current and voltage signals are continuously sampled at 8 kHz and features are extracted for each measurement cycle. The data has been collected from a main power supply (aggregated) as well as from each load using individual sensors for the same time instances. The data from individual loads are labeled accordingly in each phase of the power supply. For training and testing purpose, one week of continuously sampled data has been used. The training and test datasets are created in the ratio of 80:20 in a sequential manner with respect to the timestamp to ensure that the model is trained on past data and tested on more recent or future observations, which aligns with the temporal nature of the data. The details of the training and test samples used in this work are listed in Table 4 . 4.1 Performance of NILM for different loads To illustrate the performance of NILM for different loads, we used loads such as microwave oven, air conditioner, refrigerator, kettle, and PC (computer) for energy monitoring. The different loads connected in the electrical network are operated simultaneously to learn the signature of various combinations of loads. The basic features such as electrical quantities such as real power, reactive power, apparent power, and power factor are extracted from the raw voltage and current signals which are acquired from the main power supply for every cycle. Similarly, individual loads signals are also collected to model the NILM algorithm. LSTM network has been used to train the respective input and output features for obtaining the regression model for energy disaggregation. The energy disaggregation performance has been evaluated using the metrics such as root mean square (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and energy disaggregation accuracy (ACC). The experimental results show that the average energy disaggregation accuracy of basic features with LSTM approach (taking the average of accuracies of all loads) using different loads achieves very high accuracy approximately 98.95% due to non-overlapping signature of loads. Similarly, the performance metrics RMSE, and MAE are also have minimal error in Watts which is listed in Table 5 . The RMSE, MAE and energy disaggregation accuracy (ACC) for energy disaggregation performance evaluation can be mathematically expressed as: R M S E = 1 N ∑ i = 1 N ( A c t u a l p o w e r i − P r e d i c t e d p o w e r i ) 2 M A E = 1 N ∑ i = 1 N | A c t u a l p o w e r i − P r e d i c t e d p o w e r i | E n e r g y E s t i m a t i o n A c c u r a c y = 1 − ∑ i = 1 N | A c t u a l p o w e r i − P r e d i c t e d p o w e r i | 2 ⋅ ∑ i = 1 N A c t u a l p o w e r i From the review of literature, it is well known that the NILM system performance deteriorates when two or more similar loads are used in the electrical network. The experiments with the similar loads, air conditioners in commercial buildings are discussed in the subsequent sections. 4.2 Baseline NILM system for similar loads In baseline system, basic electrical features such as real power, reactive power, apparent power, and power factor are extracted from the raw voltage and current signals which are acquired from the main power supply for every cycle. Similarly, the electrical signals acquired from the individual loads are also processed for feature extraction for the training purpose. Therefore, features extracted from the aggregated signal and individual loads for each time step are considered as a input and output sequences respectively to model the non-intrusive load monitoring system as a regression problem. As discussed in the section 2, multiple air conditioners connected in R and Y phases are considered for the NILM. The extracted features are fed to a deep learning framework, LSTM to capture the signatures of the similar air conditioners and estimate individual power consumption of air conditioners from the given input sequence, aggregated power consumption values for each time step. In baseline system, the single LSTM layer with 1024 hidden states and followed by multiple fully connected layers, dropout layer, and output layer are used respectively. The fully connected layers parameters are started with 512 neurons (29) and decreased by 2 n − 1 up to 128 (27) parameters. Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.01 has been used to update the weights in the network. The batch size of 32 and epochs of 50 are selected empirically during the experiments. The LSTM framework and its parameters used for the baseline system are listed in Table 6 and 7 . The energy disaggregation performance has been measured using the root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and energy disaggregation accuracy (ACC). It is to be noted that the RMSE and MAE values are in Watts unit. Further, dense neural networks (DNN) and support vector regression (SVR) are also compared with the performance of the LSTM for the baseline features. DNN may help improve energy disaggregation accuracy if they are fed with hand crafted features, as they can help uncover intricate relationships and patterns in the data that may not be easily captured by the raw input. On the other hand, SVR has the ability to handle non-linear patterns through kernel functions can be advantageous when the regression problem exhibits complex, non-linear dependencies. Therefore, SVR and DNN are used to compare with the performance of LSTM for the baseline features as well as for the proposed new set of features introduced in this study. For DNN, fully connected layers are modeled with different parameters with a dropout of 0.2 for each fully connected layer. The DNN parameters are started with 1024 (210) neurons and decreased by 2 n − 1 up to 128 (27) parameters. A batch size of 32 with 0.01 learning rate, and 50 epochs are used for the experiments. The parameters used in the DNN have been listed in Table 6 are identified empirically after experimenting with different parameters. In SVR based NILM system radial basis function (RBF) kernel has been used for energy disaggregation to capture non-linear relationship between the features. The experiments and results, for the baseline system using SVR, DNN and LSTM system with the use of basic feature set for the various loads in R and Y phases respectively are listed in Table 8 . From the experiments and results it is observed that the energy disaggregation performance of the baseline LSTM outperforms the SVR and DNN for the basic feature set. The performance measures, RMSE (W) and MAE (W) are found to be considerably smaller for the LSTM based baseline system when compared to SVR and DNN. Lower the RMSE and MAE values, the performance of energy disaggregation is considered to be higher. Similarly, the energy disaggregation accuracy is also evaluated for NILM baseline system for similar loads. From Table 8, we observed that the energy disaggregation accuracy (ACC) is slightly higher for the LSTM based system when compared to SVR and DNN for the baseline features. The LSTM based system achieves average energy disaggregation accuracy (ACC) of 77.76% for similar loads using baseline features. It is to be noted that the average energy disaggregation accuracy is calculated by taking the average energy disaggregation accuracy (ACC) of total loads connected in R and Y phases. From our experimental results it is noted that the performance of the baseline system using basic features for similar loads gets affected due to the overlapping signatures of the loads which is evident when compared to the performance of the baseline features using LSTM system for different loads (Table 5). Therefore, robust features need to be identified to distinguish similar loads effectively for improving the energy disaggregation performance of the NILM system. 4.3 GM-FFS based NILM system for similar loads As the basic power features used in the baseline systems are not much effective in energy disaggregation of similar loads due to overlapping signatures, we expanded the feature set using geometric mean to extract the intrinsic relationship between the basic power features and then fused with the basic power features. We explore the geometric mean features which can be seen as a multiplicative interaction and it captures a non-linear interaction between the variables and can be useful in situations where the relationship between the variables is non-linear. In this experiment, we explore the potential of geometric features to distinguish the overlapping signature of the similar loads due to its ability to capture the non-linear interaction between the electrical quantities. As discussed in Section 3, the four basic features and the derived five geometric mean features are fused to make an expanded feature set (GM-FFS) that consists of nine features in total. The geometric mean (GM) between real power and reactive power ( G M P Q ), reactive power and apparent power ( G M Q S ), real power and current ( G M P I ), apparent power and current ( G M S I ), and real power, reactive power, and apparent power ( G M P Q S ) are extracted to expand the feature set. The GM-FFS feature set is fed to LSTM framework followed by multiple fully connected layers, dropout layer, and output layer to capture the signatures of the similar loads effectively. The LSTM layer has been modeled with 1024 neurons or units and then the output is fed to fully connected layers from 29 neurons and reduced up to 27 neurons for learning the signatures effectively. Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.01 has been used to update the weights in the network. The batch size of 32 and epochs of 50 are used for the experiments. The parameters for the LSTM network and fully connected layers are chosen empirically for its best performance. The Table 6 and 7 lists the optimal hyperparameters used in the GM-FFS based NILM system. It is to be noted that in all the experiments, the LSTM based deep learning model has been trained for the loads in R and Y phases separately. It means that each phase has its own model for monitoring the loads connected to them. The energy disaggregation performance of GM-FFS based LSTM networks achieves the average accuracy of 81.54% (averaging the accuracies of all the loads in R and Y phases) for the similar loads. Further, the proposed new feature set GM-FFS has also been experimented with DNN and SVR for a comparing its performance with different regression models. DNNs are capable of automatically learning complex patterns and representations from data, making them suitable for capturing intricate relationships in regression tasks. In this work we fed the proposed GM-FFS features set to DNN to check its performance. DNN architecture has been modeled with four fully connected layers with a drop out neurons of 0.2 at the output of every fully connected layers. The fully connected layers have 210 neurons or units at the top layer and it was gradually reduced to 2 9 , 2 8 , and 27 subsequently at each layer to obtain the best performance of the system. All the parameters for the DNN are selected empirically for its best performance. The GM-FFS based DNN system achieves the average energy disaggregation accuracy of 80.20%. Similarly, the disaggregation error has been reduced significantly for the RMSE (W) and MAE (W) respectively. Further, the GM-FFS based SVR system has also experimented to compare its performance against LSTM and DNN systems. SVR is particularly effective in handling nonlinear relationships between input variables and target outputs. By utilizing kernel functions, SVR can implicitly map the data to a higher-dimensional feature space, enabling it to capture complex non-linear patterns and relationships that may be challenging for linear regression models. From our experiments, we observed that the SVR using the RBF kernel did not perform well in terms of energy disaggregation accuracy, RMSE, and MAE when compared to DNN and LSTM based GM-FFS systems. The experimental results for the GM-FFS system using SVR, DNN and LSTM are listed in Table 9 . Further, we also compare the average energy disaggregation performance across all the loads in R and Y phases for illustrating the overall performance of the baseline features and GM-FFS features for the SVR, DNN and LSTM based systems in Table 10 . From the experiments and results, it is observed that the GM-FFS based LSTM approach outperforms the other baseline systems such as basic features with SVR, DNN and LSTM, and GM-FFS based SVR and DNN systems. Table 9 and 10 reveals that the derived features using geometric mean help to improve the energy disaggregation performance significantly. In other words, the fusion of electrical power features and the derived statistical features using geometric mean effectively captures the multiple similar load signatures in the input feature space and help distinguish them when they are modeled using the deep learning framework, LSTM for energy disaggregation. Although SVR is effective in handling non-linear relationships, it may struggle to capture temporal dependencies and patterns inherent in sequential time series data. Due to its kernel-based approach, SVR may not fully exploit the sequential nature of the data, resulting in suboptimal performance for the GM-FFS based NILM systems. Similarly, DNNs may face challenges when applied to sequential time series data due to their lack of explicit memory and inability to capture long-term dependencies. While DNNs excel at capturing complex patterns in non-sequential data, they may struggle to effectively model the temporal dynamics present in sequential time series data. Additionally, DNNs often require a large amount of training data to generalize well, which can be a limitation in scenarios where data is limited. In contrast, LSTM, purpose-built for sequential data, excels in modeling long-term dependencies and understanding temporal dynamics. Its specialized architecture, equipped with memory cells and recurrent connections, empowers LSTM to capture appliance-level patterns and dependencies effectively, making it superior to SVR and DNN in the NILM systems for similar loads. Further, the proposed approach has been implemented in the developed edge device and it monitors the multiple similar loads in the real-time effectively in the commercial building. All the experiments presented in this study are carried out from the data collected from the deployed DeepEdge NILM device. It is to be noted that initially the power consumption from the multiple similar loads and aggregated power from the main power supply are collected through the developed edge device, and the data has been sent to remote server for training the models for the R and Y phases of building. The trained model has been uploaded again to the edge device through remote access for continuous load monitoring and energy disaggregation. The performance of the deployed DeepEdge NILM device has been illustrated through the geometric mean based fused feature set (GM-FFS) with LSTM deep learning model. Further, the trained model can be updated over the period of time when more data is available or if any changes happened in the monitoring environment, for example, any change/replacement of loads in building. 5 Limitations and future scope Though the presented case study of NILM edge device is a promising one to monitor the similar loads from the aggregated power signals, there exist few limitations in disaggregating the power signals. In a supervised learning approach, NILM algorithm needs to learn the signature of loads when they are operated separately and with multiple combinations of loads. However this is not always possible to manually turn on or turn off the loads with various combinations in the commercial buildings, since this process will affect the routine operations of the buildings. Therefore, training phase may take one or two weeks of waiting time to capture the different load combinations which may happen naturally during its operations and services in the commercial building. In commercial buildings, many similar loads are available. For example, many same model/similar lighting systems are being used. The lighting system would also consume some significant amount of energy from the total energy utilization. However, it is nearly impossible to train and model the lighting systems since connecting plugin sensors for every light is not feasible in commercial buildings. Though there is a possible solution by grouping the entire lighting systems as a single load, the energy disaggregation accuracy might not be always accurate enough when some of the lights were not used. Further, there will always be some unknown loads existing in commercial buildings, and they may be connected or removed at any time, which would affect the performance of NILM systems. In this scenario, unsupervised learning or trainingless approaches may be effective to identify the unknown or new loads in the monitoring environment. However, these algorithms would take several weeks to months to learn the major loads itself. Therefore, the selection of type of algorithms should be made as per the customer needs and their interest in monitoring specific high power consumption loads for effective energy disaggregation in commercial and industrial buildings. 6 Conclusions In this work, a case study of non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) edge device in the commercial building has been presented. We considered an office environment, where it is common to use multiple similar type of air conditioners. First, we developed an instrument/edge device to acquire, process and measure the electrical signals for monitoring the electrical loads, air conditioners using non-intrusive load monitoring approach. Initially, we demonstrated the performance of basic features for different loads and similar loads to understand the non-overlapping and overlapping signatures of loads in NILM system. From experiments and results, it is observed that the performance of basic features for similar loads deteriorates significantly when compared to the performance of different loads due to overlapping signatures. We then derived a new feature set, geometric mean based fused feature set (GM-FFS) by computing geometric mean between the basic electrical features, and fused it with the basic features to capture the signatures of similar loads effectively. The features extracted from the aggregated power signals measured at the main power supply have been used as a input of the function and mapped it to learn the corresponding disaggregated power signals of the individual loads using the deep learning framework, long-short term memory (LSTM) networks. Further, the GM-FFS features are also experimented with support vector regression (SVR), and dense neural networks (DNN) for comparing its performance with different regression models. From the experiments and results, it is noted that the proposed GM-FFS based LSTM network outperforms the baseline systems by effectively capturing the non-linear interaction between the electrical quantities and therefore helps distinguish the overlapping signatures of similar loads effectively when compared to basic power features. Therefore, the GM-FFS could be the potential feature set to further explore the NILM devices to monitor various similar loads used in different application specific commercial/industrial buildings. Further, the scope of the NILM device need to be well defined in case of commercial/industrial buildings for effective energy disaggregation of loads.

        "dc:description": "Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) has become an emerging technology in the energy sector for its effectiveness in the energy disaggregation of individual loads from the measured aggregated energy in main power supply of building. NILM has also evolved gradually over the past few decades, due to the significant advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), embedded/edge devices, and internet of things (IoT). From the review of literature, we observed that most of the NILM systems were only capable of monitoring different loads and it fails to detect and disaggregate the energy consumption of similar loads effectively. Further, most of works in the literature were focused on improving the performance of energy disaggregation of different loads in residential buildings and very limited works have been carried out for the similar loads in NILM system. Therefore, there is a necessity to study and evaluate the state of the art NILM algorithms for similar loads in real case scenarios for effective implementation in the commercial and industrial buildings. In this paper, we present a case study of the developed DeepEdge-NILM device which has been installed in a commercial building (office environment), where multiple similar and identical air conditioners (AC's) are used in the monitoring environment. A deep learning framework, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) has been implemented on the new set of features which comprises of electrical features and intrinsic features derived from the basic electric features using geometric mean for capturing the signature of similar loads effectively. From our case study, we observed that the performance of the deployed NILM system outperforms the baseline systems that have been developed using basic electrical features significantly. Finally, the limitations and future scope of the NILM edge device in the commercial buildings are also discussed.",
