Peter-Jordan Straße 82 1190 Vienna Austria Laboratory buildings are one of the most energy intensive commercial building types. High requirements on indoor air quality combined with safety regulations result in high air change rates for ventilation. Air handling units are the main energy consumers in laboratory buildings and are therefore predestinated for energy efficiency measures. In this work the holistic integration of passive infrared (PIR) motion detectors for controlling variable air volume systems in a laboratory (R&D) building is presented. In total, 72 laboratories were equipped with PIR motion detectors. Their operation and activity have been monitored for several months. Average occupancy/Degree of Capacity Utilization (DCU) in big labs was found to be at maximum 90% during a normal working day whereas in small labs, this number decreases to approximately 70%. On weekends occupancy/DCU was higher than expected, reaching values between 10% and 20%. Compared to a typical fixed time program or Time Control Program (TCP), PIR-triggered occupancy-based air control yields savings of up to 18 % in electricity consumption for the scientifically evaluated time period 11.2020 \u2013 09.2021. The economic evaluation for the investigated energy-efficiency measure stated a payback period of less than three years. Keywords Demand controlled ventilation Energy efficiency measures Motion detection Air handling unit Occupancy pattern 1 Motivation A decrease in energy consumption and significant increase in energy efficiency of the existing commercial building stock are mandatory in striving for lower carbon footprints when facing global climate challenges. Normative regulations and guidelines concerning energy consumption and -efficiency do exist for new buildings but are virtually non-existent for the present commercial building stock. The main energy consumers in R&D institutions (such as Universities) are quickly identified: HVAC equipment and, depending on illuminance requirements and installed lighting technologies in laboratories, the lighting system as well. A demand-driven, or more precisely, an occupancy-based control of these Building Engineering Services (BES) should be self-evident, yet too often, the user is faced with fixed and constant operating schedules for these services. Motion detectors for lighting control are widely in use in the commercial building stock (at least at the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna), yet often, their application is restricted to sanitary engineering rooms and general areas such as halls, corridors, engineering rooms etc. In more demanding areas, such as offices, lecture halls, seminar rooms and laboratories, no occupancy sensors have been installed previously, thus lighting control was dependent on end user operation (and -behavior!) and HVAC- or rather AHU- (Air Handling Unit) control was based on fixed schedules and/or a predefined time program. In a previous paper [1], the authors highlighted the energy benefits of a time controlled, multi-state operation of AHU\u2019s in comparison to a fixed and constant operation in a 2007 university building for teaching and biotechnology research. The present paper techno-economically evaluates the holistic integration of PIR-based occupancy sensors for HVAC- (and partly lighting) control in laboratory rooms of the same 2007 university building. 2 Introduction Despite raised energy efficiency standards for new buildings in the EU, the share of commercial buildings and public services in the final energy consumption is still rising. Over the past decade final energy consumption increased by 3.8% in the service sector, whereas total final energy consumption decreased by 7.1% [2]. Vakiloroaya et al. [3] came to the conclusion that, focusing on reducing energy consumption in buildings, the main approach lies within the Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) building services. The share of HVAC energy use in commercial buildings, although varying depending on specific building type and country, is significantly high. For office buildings the numbers in literature vary between 39 % in Australia [4], 48 % in the USA, 55 % in the UK and 52 % in Spain [5]. For Canada the share of HVAC in commercial and institutional buildings accounts for up to 60 % [6]. Globally about 40% of the total energy consumption in commercial buildings is used for HVAC operation [7]. The main purpose of HVAC in commercial buildings is to maintain a comfortable and safe environment for occupants, equipment and the building itself. Thus minimal requirements should guarantee functionality and safety for the building substance (e.g to prevent mould, frozen pipes etc.) at any time [8]. Still, the majority of modern commercial buildings provides space conditioning for maximum occupancy instead of aiming at actual usage and requirements [9]. A very common control strategy for HVAC applications are still predefined or fixed schedules, which do not take occupancy into account [10]. It is obvious that an efficient operation of the Building Engineering Services (BES) (especially HVAC) needs to adapt to actual (user) requirements. Ouf et al. [8] introduces the term \u201cadaptability\u201d of buildings. This stands for the ability of a building to adjust BES-operation to actual needs (occupancy) on a temporal and spatial scale. Hereby, energy consumption and occupancy show proportionality. The approach of occupancy-driven HVAC control, optimally leads to significant energy savings without sacrificing any comfort for its occupants [11]. 2.1 Achievable energy savings through Occupancy-Based building control (OBBC) The energy savings potential, when using occupancy sensing for HVAC control instead of conventional static schedules, is highly dependent on the frequency and intensity of use for the examined area/space. This is to be kept in mind when comparing various energy saving figures across literature [9,11\u201316]. The savings\u2019 potential can range from low, i.e. 0 to 10% up to nearly 40% according to Siddharth et al. [12] when designated office- and laboratory rooms in research institutions are in question. Table 1 summarizes in detail the energy savings potential in commercial buildings with experimental results achieved through real setup testing and evaluation. For this work\u2019s literature research focus has been placed on papers with a similar experimental setup to the energy efficiency measure originally planned by the authors for the mentioned 2007 university building in Vienna. Also, the published energy savings results had to be measured and/or validated in real configurations rather than being theoretically calculated or simulated data only. The occupancy-based control was throughout realized by connecting the occupancy signal directly to the terminal boxes (units) in the examined rooms/areas [9,12,13,16\u201319]. In some cases, the incorporated control strategies resulted in immediate air flow setback based on occupancy input [12,18,19]. Some authors additionally accounted for temperature setback in case of room conditioning (i.e. heating and cooling) by means of the terminal box control [9,13,16,17]. The building areas covered in the experimental setups range from typical office rooms, to conference/seminar rooms, libraries and laboratory rooms. The buildings in question were mostly typical university buildings for research and teaching activities. 2.2 Requirements for OBC For an occupancy-based building operation, mostly building retrofits have to be performed. Depending on existing technical building equipment and degree of (HVAC-) automation, the following requirements have to be met: First, existing technical equipment need to be ready for or adaptable to variable operation. In most modern buildings, fans, pumps and other drives are already variable speed driven, which allows efficient partial load operation. For air handling units, variable air volume (VAV) flow systems are essential for demand-controlled operation. Second, occupancy information needs to be available. This includes e.g. a suitable sensor network, sensor information distribution etc. and thirdly, occupancy information needs to be integrated into the building automation and control system (BACS) to initiate occupancy-based operation of HVAC equipment for actual needs. For occupancy detection several technologies are readily available. Chen et al. [20] gives a detailed overview of current occupancy detection systems. So far, each technology has its advantages and drawbacks. Passive infrared radiation (PIR) sensors are most widely used and whilst being inexpensive and simple, they usually lack the ability of detecting \u2018static occupants\u2019 or the number of occupants present in a room. Smart energy meters are another, often mentioned detection approach. Most commercial buildings already have smart meters installed, which avoids additional installation costs. With advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning applications, smart meters have a potential for low-cost occupancy estimation in the near future. Nevertheless, the relationship between energy consumption and occupancy figures is not proportional. Environmental sensors like temperature-, humidity- or CO2-sensors are low-cost equipment, but also have low detection accuracy and significant detection delay. Cameras for occupancy detection are providing highly accurate information and although there is specific software available to meet privacy concerns, there is mistrust and objection from the occupants\u2019 side. Additionally, cameras usually cause high computational complexity and require significant computing power when processing occupancy information continuously. Another approach for occupancy detection is to use WIFI devices (e.g. smartphones) in a network. The advantages are no additional hardware costs and a high detection accuracy. Naturally, problems may occur through interaction with IT (WIFI) and the BACS network and are also dependent on signal strength and -availability. Finally, Chen et al. [20] also mention other sensors (ultrasonic sensors, RFID, Bluetooth) and sensor fusion, which is a mix of the different available technologies. 2.3 Benefits and draw-backs of PIR-technology This research paper focuses on the use of simple PIR sensors for effective occupancy-based building control. This type of occupancy sensor is categorized as motion detector. As the name indicates, PIR sensors are passive devices. This means they are passively measuring changes in temperature, without emitting any signals [21]. Thus internal power consumption in modern sensors is negligibly low (<1W) [22]. PIR sensors are commonly used in a wide range of applications for occupancy detection, especially for lighting control [23]. There is a large variety of different models on the market with custom-designed technical specifications and various configurations, e.g. input voltage (24VDC/230VAC), bus type (KNX/C-Bus 100/I2C-bus etc.), lighting management system (DALI), dimmer function, contacts for HVAC-integration, different Master-Slave configurations etc. The price of PIR sensors is, compared to other sensor technologies, relatively low and privacy concerns are negligible [24]. Nevertheless, there are several drawbacks of PIR sensor technology. First, PIR sensors cannot detect stationary or very slowly moving occupants. Although modern sensors claim to have high-resolution presence detection, it is doubtful whether small movements during deskwork can be detected reliably. The sensitivity of PIR sensors decreases with distance between the object and the sensor [21]. Therefore, special attention for accurate sensor placement and -positioning within a room has to be paid. Chen et al. [11] mentions that there is still lack of scientific work for optimal sensor placement. Second, PIR sensors have only a binary output for occupancy detection i.e. present or absent. In a typical configuration, PIR sensors are unable to count or even estimate the actual number of persons [25]. Therefore, the informational quality of PIR occupancy data is quite low, compared to other more sophisticated detection technologies. In special configurations, as Wahl et al. [26] describes, it is possible to detect (estimate) the actual number of persons with PIR sensors. However, this requires a significantly higher sensor count and special algorithms for data evaluation. Thirdly, PIR sensors need direct \u201cvisual contact\u201d with the occupants, so detecting persons behind physical obstacles is not possible. Especially in rooms/spaces with contorted layouts, several sensors are necessary for adequate coverage and reliable detection [27]. Into a fourth, PIR sensors are susceptible for detection errors due to external heat sources such as appliances (e.g. laboratory equipment), HVAC-equipment or even animals [25]. The presented evaluation of occupancy-based building control with its energy savings potential is limited to the application of PIR-sensors in laboratory rooms only in the mentioned 2007 university building. Despite the mentioned drawbacks of PIR technology, it still has been chosen as the preferred option for demand-controlled, occupancy-based ventilation in laboratories of our university building. This is mainly due to the fact that it is of secondary importance \u2013 albeit not none in respect to potential energy efficiency optimizations \u2013 whether only one or more persons are present in a laboratory room. This is because, according to present regulations, the required air exchange rate has to be established the moment the room is being occupied and users are potentially exposed to possible hazards. Sufficient PIR switching delay times from 15 min to one hour according to specific laboratory use should avoid unnecessary \u2018switching/cycling\u2019 in the lighting system- and VAV-control and therefore increase detection accuracy (as occupants are expected to move within this delay times). 3 Objectives So far, scientifically researched \u2018experimental\u2019 application of OBC is often being limited to either a limited area of the examined building, e.g. a specific homogeneous space such as offices, or to a specific research aspect, e.g. functionality of present sensors. Few published studies can be found with a holistic approach such as within this paper, covering all steps to scientifically analyze the energy- and costs-benefits of occupancy-based HVAC control in institutional laboratory buildings. The innovative aspects/objectives of the present paper can therefore be summarized as: \u2022 Introduction of a holistic approach to occupancy-sensing for HVAC control in institutional laboratory buildings The mentioned PIR-sensors have been installed throughout the whole building, including 72 laboratory rooms for research to yield a realistic assessment of the OBC strategy in commercial (university) buildings. \u2022 Provision of real detailed occupancy patterns (PIR data) for commercial/institutional buildings for applications in automated AHU control Due to the conducted field tests for gathering occupancy data, these results can serve as data basis for other possible room control measures (e.g. using more sophisticated, individuals-counting occupancy sensors to establish an even more accurate demand-based HVAC/room control) and help in estimating the resulting energy savings potential for similar applications. \u2022 Techno-economic evaluation of PIR-based occupancy sensing for HVAC control Because of such a holistic approach, the evaluation of the implemented OBC strategy can serve as decision-making aid (suggestion/reference for facility managers and commercial building owners) when it comes to planning and conceptualizing energy efficiency measures for commercial buildings. 4 Methodology As summarized in Fig. 1 , the performed actions to achieve the above-mentioned goals are (in chronological order): \u2022 PIR test trial- and planning phase \u2022 predefined OBC-test runs in specific laboratory rooms and \u2018PIR-activity-simulation\u2019 (AHU measurements with manually triggered air flow reductions/simulated PIR-activity) In order to examine the effects of occupancy-based air control for laboratories, PIR sensors have been installed in two specific laboratory test rooms, a universal- and a laboratory room for teaching purposes only. Both rooms feature terminal boxes (VAV) for individual air control and differ significantly in terms of user time schedules. For a period of several months, the PIR-activity has been monitored to gain detailed time distribution data (between occupied-/presence and unoccupied/absence room). The results served as basis for the evaluation of the potential of using OBC for room conditioning in various laboratories. Furthermore, a series of measurements have been conducted at one specific AHU to \u2018simulate\u2019 PIR activity, i.e. potential \u2018closing\u2019 of VAV-boxes resulting in reduced AHU energy consumption. \u2022 evaluation of occupancy profiling in test rooms and virtual \u2018PIR-activity-simulation\u2019 (real measurements at AHU) to exploit the potential of OBC in the examined institutional building The obtained results from the OBC-experiments in the two test rooms and from the conducted measurements to simulate PIR activity have formed the scientific basis for (savings-) calculations and (conceptual) considerations to expand the OBC-project to nearly all laboratories in the mentioned university building. \u2022 analysis of space use and specific laboratory conditions to define use patterns for each type of laboratory room All \u2013 potentially relevant to OBC \u2013 laboratories have then been investigated for applicability and suitability for PIR-based air control and possible obstacles in the implementation of the planned control strategy. As a consequence, extensively used laboratory rooms, clean room laboratories and critical areas (e.g. for laser-experiments) have been excluded from the project. \u2022 organizational preparations to inform/include all building users Necessary organizational preparations have been performed to inform all users and technical personnel of the \u2018affected\u2019 institutes and research institutions. These time-consuming preparations were inevitable to eliminate unfounded preconceptions and prejudices of the technical- and scientific staff. \u2022 definition of specific sensor requirements such as suitable PIR-types, master/slave configurations, required sensor quantity and -positioning within each room After finalizing the organizational preparations, the technical aspects for the PIR-occupancy-based air control have been determined: suitable sensors and master\u2013slave configurations have been chosen together with detailed placement, installation and wiring of those in each laboratory. \u2022 Installation- and commissioning phase \u2022 PIR integration and visualization Continuing the OBC project after concluding the conceptual and technical design phase, the necessary devices (i.e. sensors, switches and auxiliary equipment such as additional I/O-interfaces in the switchboards etc.) have been installed and integrated in the BACS for visualization and OBC operation. \u2022 preset necessary parametrization of PIR sensors depending on room requirements After installation and commissioning, the sensors have been preset (delay time, master\u2013slave assignment, light co-control etc.) according to the expected user pattern of the laboratory rooms. Also, the correct functionality and visual implementation of all devices have been checked and tested for final approval. \u2022 incorporate OBC-visualization in BACS with several (air) control options based on: o time program only, o PIR-sensor control (OBC) only, o mix of OBC and time program control As mentioned before, the PIR-sensors have been integrated as binary Signal (Digital In) in the BACS (using BACnet protocol) for visualization of sensor activity. Consequently, various air control modes have been programmed for each laboratory room in the visual BACS interface to allow for monitoring and easy evaluation of the new OBC strategy in comparison to the present time program control. \u2022 Monitoring- and OBC evaluation phase \u2022 evaluate occupancy profiles from PIR-activity to establish typical occupancy patterns for a specific type of building (use) PIR activity has then been monitored for several months and evaluated to establish typical occupancy patterns. These patterns can serve as basic template for newly applying OBC in commercial buildings with similar room use (R&D departments, laboratories in research institutions/universities etc.). \u2022 perform detailed sensor parameter adaptations to account for user preferences and specific room use After several weeks of OBC use, necessary adaptations to sensor parameters, -positioning and control options have been performed to maximize user comfort and energy efficiency. In addition, user preferences have been realized and faulty sensor functions eliminated. \u2022 evaluate energy consumption before and after OBC implementation through detailed energy monitoring The building\u2019s energy monitoring system, \u2018RESma\u2019-Software by GTI Control/Germany, integrated in 2016 and comprising several permanently installed electric meters and some additional thermal meters covering energy use of individual (main) air handling units, has been used at the examined building to assess energy consumption before and after the implementation of the OBC system in laboratories. \u2022 define OBC optimization (energy reduction) potential according to technical specifications of o examined building area o specific room use o occupancy profiles and o integrated technical infrastructure (AHU power and quantity) Therefore, a thorough evaluation of the benefits and cost reduction potential of OBC at laboratory (university) building level has been carried out respecting building- and AHU size, specific room usage and degree of building automation to yield a realistic estimation of the optimization potential of such room-conditioning control strategies. 4.1 Details \u2013 Technical equipment and air control options \u2022 Installed sensors and connection diagram Altogether, 111 PIR sensors including 72 master- and 39 slave devices with several IR remote controls were installed in 72 laboratory rooms. Detailed specifications of the chosen PIR sensors by Esylux (Germany) are shown in Table 2 . Switch-off delay times vary between 1 and 15 min or 1 Hour for the HVAC channel and 1 to 30 min for the lighting channel and have to be adjusted according to specific room requirements, i.e. intensity of room use and -capacity and also user preferences, especially concerning the automated sensor lighting switch with its delay time. Costs for this specific sensor vary between 90 and 130 Eur per piece and depend on the exact sensor configuration and accessory mounting- and remote control equipment. Gross overall economic calculations are specified in the subsequent results section of this paper. As can be seen in Fig. 2 , the PIR sensors have been electrically connected using the given distribution boxes (lighting) in the false ceiling. The switching channels of the PIR sensors have been used to automatically control (on/off/semi-automatic) room lighting and trigger opening (from Eco- to Comfort-mode) and closing (from Comfort- to Eco-mode) the incorporated VAV-boxes of the individual room control. The signal cables have thereby been routed to the nearest available automation station and plugged into a free Digital-IN port. In cases with no free available ports, the installation of additional BACnet Digital In modules in the automation station has been rendered necessary. The controllers communicate via BACnet with the Siemens Desigo Insight Building Automation and Control System (BACS). \u2022 BACS and control options The primary intention for the incorporation of the PIR sensors was delivering activity (presence)-triggered, demand-controlled inputs for the VAV-terminal boxes so as to achieve a lowest possible main fan load while operating the AHU under constant duct pressure conditions. For reasons of operational safety and user flexibility, three VAV-control options have been programmed for every single (PIR-equipped) laboratory and can be assessed through the visual User Interface: \u2022 fixed schedule for VAV-control; i.e.: preset Time Control Program (TCP, e.g. opening the air boxes to normal settings in the time of 06:00 to 20:00o\u2019clock, Mo - Fr), \u2022 solely PIR activity (daily presence-controlled box activity) or \u2022 TCP or PIR-activity, whichever triggers first (for highest user comfort/safety reasons). Of course, the primarily desired option is solely PIR-triggered box control to achieve lowest possible fan loads, i.e., highest possible reduction of AHU energy consumption, but in cases of occurrent PIR-servicing, defective- or shortly undesired PIR-operation, higher user comfort etc., other control modes can be chosen by the building manager. 5 Experimental a. Simulating \u2018PIR-activity\u2019 by manually altering VAV box settings (including air flow- and fan power measurements) In order to assess and calculate the energy efficiency potential of occupancy-based air control, the prospective PIR activity in laboratory rooms has been experimentally \u2018simulated\u2019 at AHU L0301 by deliberately and continuously closing individual VAV terminal boxes of the correspondingly conditioned laboratory rooms while still operating the AHU under static duct pressure conditions. Starting from the AHU setup under normal operating conditions, VAV-box settings of several, bigger, more air/energy consuming laboratory rooms have been altered from normal, i.e.: nominal air volume flow to reduced/minimum air volume flow thus simulating PIR- (absence-) triggered VAV box closingHereby it is important to notice, that the previously mechanically set damper range of 0% − 100% of a VAV-box corresponds to the permissible air volume flow band, ranging from minimum flow conditions (0% or minimum damper potentiometer setting = \u2018Eco\u2019-mode) up to maximum/designed air flow conditions (100% or maximum damper poti setting = \u2018Comfort\u2019-mode) for a specific laboratory room. A to be installed PIR-sensor, that senses absence/no activity for a certain amount of time in a laboratory room, directly switches the VAV-box into \u2018Eco\u2019-mode, which means a reduction in supplied volume flow by altering the damper setting form 100% to 0% (i.e. minimum flow). In no configuration/VAV-setting whatsoever there is zero air flow into the room. The VAV-boxes operate/are switching between two single modes: \u2018Comfort\u2019 (100%)- and \u2018Eco\u2019 (0%)-mode. The boxes are mechanically preconfigured (by means of pots) to supply minimum airflow at minimum box setting (0%) and maximum airflow at maximum (100%) box setting. The maximum setting (100%) normally provides the nominal/design airflow into the room whereas the minimum setting (0%) usually still delivers approximately 50% of the nominal airflow into the room. This is because in our laboratory rooms, the important air change rate should not drop below a certain operational security level. These \u2018preset box-settings\u2019 are usually being initially adjusted (often room-dependently) and need to be assessed and respected prior to any alterations in air- and/or VAV box control. Table 3 defines the box settings of the respected measurements series, whereas Table 4 lists the AHU parameters and measurement results of these experimental \u2018PIR-activity-simulations\u2019. Regarding Table 3, the manual switching from \u2018Comfort\u2019- to \u2018Eco\u2019-mode has been performed for several rooms of AHU L0301 in chronological order, starting with room no. EG/022 and continuously switching more and more rooms into Eco-mode: for example, measurement series no.3 indicates that 6 rooms, from no.1 to no.6, have already been switched into Eco-mode. In the end, see measurement series no.4, all 12 rooms being \u2018fed\u2019 by AHU L0301 have been switched into Eco-mode. As the rooms differ in size and, more important, supplied air volume flow, the dependency between the reductions in air volume flow due to the manually triggered ECO-mode, which \u2018simulates\u2019 the signal output of the prospective PIR-sensor, and the therefore reduced electrical power consumption of the corresponding AHU-fan due to the constant duct pressure control had to be established. In this way the results could serve as a more generalized estimate for the potential of occupancy-based air control in laboratory rooms, see also Table 4. Electrical fan power values have been extracted directly from the Energy Monitoring System ResMa, air volume flow has been measured with a Testo 435\u20134 flow analyzer and a hot wire probe Nr. 0635 1025 and cross-checked with a 7 mm (diam.) Prandtl-probe Nr. 0635 2045 and a 16 mm (diam.) vane probe Nr. 0635 9532 by Testo. Due to a more recent calibration and better suited effective measurement range, subsequent savings-calculations have been performed based on measurement results using the Testo hot wire probe only. The obtained measurement results in Table 4, main air volume flow and electric fan power, have been pulled together and used for establishing a mathematical description for the observed dependencies. The overall potential energy cost savings have then been calculated considering achievable reductions in annual electric fan consumption and estimated proportional district heating or -cooling energy demand based on the amount of air volume flow reduction, resulting from switching the VAV boxes of xy laboratory rooms from \u2018Comfort\u2019- to \u2018Eco-\u2019 mode for xy hours daily (\u2018xy\u2019-values to be set by user). Potential cost saving results are described in more detail in the next chapter and provide a rough planning estimate for the expected savings when implementing PIR sensors for occupancy-based HVAC control. 5.1 Real PIR sensor-trials in laboratory test rooms As mentioned in the methodology section before, two laboratory test rooms have been tentatively equipped with PIR sensors in the project\u2019s planning phase to examine the effects of occupancy-controlled air supply, especially with regard to the daily-time-relation (duration in hours) between \u2018Comfort\u2019- (presence detected/nominal air supply) and \u2018Economy\u2019- (absence detected/reduced or minimum air supply) mode. Albeit the experimental results can only serve as a rough basis for further considerations, by choosing a \u2018typical\u2019 (i.e. in size and use), standardized research lab, a clear indication for the optimization potential can be obtained. Again, the results, being essentially the provision of the documented daily hours (see xy values above) of the VAV boxes in \u2018ECO\u2019-mode, are not to be generalized and cannot serve as unerring method for \u2018up-scaling\u2019 of the expectable effects. However, as measuring and defining a concrete hourly use-pattern for every single laboratory room of the research building would be far out of scope for such an energy efficiency project, the results from both, the PIR sensor trials in the test labs (b.) as well as the experimental measurements \u2018simulating\u2019 PIR activity (a.) had to serve as calculation- and planning basis for further project considerations, i.e. the expansion of PIR sensor integration to (nearly) all laboratory rooms and realization of holistic occupancy-based HVAC control. To summarize the experimental phase, we would like to point out that there is no direct link between data from a., the experimental measurements (\u2018simulated PIR-activity by manual intervention\u2019) as in Table 4 and b., data from the experiments obtained by installing real PIR sensors in two laboratory test rooms. Data as in Table 4 served for calculating the potential savings through reductions in fan energy consumption. Data from the \u2018real\u2019 test trials served as estimate for the time duration the rooms would remain in Eco-mode due to the installed PIR sensors (how many hours daily?). Together, the experimental results formed the calculatory basis for the estimation/prediction of the potential energy- and cost savings as in Table 5 . Furthermore, the results from these prior experiments led to the initiation of the subsequent project, i.e. the installation, operation and evaluation of PIR sensors in 72 laboratory rooms. 6 Results and discussion The obtained results for PIR-triggered OBC in laboratory rooms of commercial buildings can be classified as follows: a. energy cost savings potential, structured by box settings (hours in \u2018ECO\u2019-mode) b. detailed occupancy data, structured by lab size and operational time period c. techno-economic evaluation, based on achieved energy savings and overall costs 6.1 Energy cost savings potential Based on the results of the experimental PIR-measurements, both the virtual \u2018PIR-activity\u2019 simulation as well as the PIR-evaluation in the test labs, several payback scenarios for the holistic integration of PIR sensors in the laboratories of the aforementioned building were calculated. Due to absence of specific thermal energy meters for AHU L0301, the costs for thermal energy (district heating/-cooling) have been deducted from annual thermal energy bills and approximately allocated to the investigated AHU L0301 (roughly 25%). In doing so, thermal energy costs were considered to be reduced in an aliquot way as the PIR-induced reduction of daily \u2013 normally to be conditioned (heated/cooled) \u2013 air volume flow. Furthermore, as the \u2018ECO\u2019-mode of the VAV boxes is usually set at still delivering nearly 50% of the nominal air volume flow, further energy saving potential lies within additional manual adjustments (setting the minimum air flow) of the VAV boxes. It has to be mentioned, that the calculations only consider actual, not estimated initial investment costs, i.e. material-, installation-, programming- and commissioning costs, but no service-, maintenance- or operational costs, which are considered to be negligible. Table 5 shows relevant information concerning costs and achievable savings as well as realistic payback periods. As can be seen in Table 5, payback periods significantly vary between 2,6 and 6,5 years, heavily depending on the underlying time duration in \u2018ECO\u2019-mode of the VAV boxes and thus the specific usage pattern of the laboratories. So, taking into account the results from the PIR-test trial labs for daily hours of mean reduced air flow through PIR sensors and considering usual VAV box setups in typical reduced/economic mode (i.e.: 50% of nominal air volume flow), payback periods between three and four years should present a mean (realistic) assumption, especially for other, similar commercial buildings and research institutions with pronounced lab infrastructure. 6.2 Detailed occupancy data Besides the provision of a detailed techno-economic evaluation of PIR-based occupancy sensing for HVAC control (described in the final passage of the results section), a main objective of this paper is to supply and discuss real, measured occupancy data for university laboratory buildings with pronounced lab infrastructure. The following data, which represent non-personalized occupancy patterns for small (<1000 m3/h nominal air supply) and big (>1000 m3/h nominal air supply) laboratory rooms, generated through evaluation of recorded PIR-activity data, have been collected during the time period 19.10.2020 \u2013 15.11.2020 as well as 14.12.2020 \u2013 10.01.2021 and afterwards classified into three operational time periods. Thus, providing a fundamental, all-year-round occupancy data basis for e.g. forecast-based control algorithms or other planning-/calculation tools for optimized, i.e. occupancy-based HVAC control in buildings. The three operational time periods are defined as follows: 1. regular period - normal working intensity (workdays, Mo \u2013 Fr) 2. irregular period - reduced working intensity (pre-, post-holiday time, partly summer time etc.) 3. holiday period - dialed down working intensity (public and specific holidays, partly summer time, weekends etc.) 6.2.1 COVID19-impact As all of the evaluated occupancy data originate from a time period highly impacted by some specific working regulations (such as \u2018Home-Office-guidelines etc.), the validity of these occupancy profiles/-patterns surely would need to be cross-checked in an \u2018undisturbed\u2019 period of time. Nevertheless, highly experimental work (which is mainly done in labs) has been continued under individual security regulations ever since Corona-induced restrictions were established by the university management. As for the activity of the installed PIR sensors: it should not matter much, by means of carefully planned sensor positioning/-configurations, whether the labs are being occupied by a single person or are already reaching their capacity limits. However, experimental test procedures in order to verify the quality of sensor positioning and -configuration have not been performed prior to commissioning. 6.2.2 Exemplary occupancy profiles for regular time period (incl. weekend) Figs. 3 and 4 show daily occupancy profiles for small and big laboratory rooms (\u2018labs\u2019) in the exemplary time period 19.10.2020 \u2013 26.10.2020 including \u2018normal\u2019 workdays (Mo \u2013 Fr) and also weekend days (Sa \u2013 Su) for comparative reasons. PIR-triggered \u2018presence\u2019 signals are hereby temporally added together to obtain a Degree of (simultaneous, overall) Capacity Utilization (referred to as \u2018DCU\u2019 in the following) for all PIR-equipped labs. So, in other words, a DCU of 60% for a given time point means, that one is obtaining a \u2018presence/occupied-signal\u2019 from 60% of all PIR-equipped laboratories for this time instant. For the mean occupancy in Fig. 5 , we have summarized all PIR-triggered \u2018presence\u2019 signals at a 10 min time step/interval. In other words, for the occupancy function from 08:00 to 09:00o\u2019clock, we have added together sensor data at 08:00, 08:10, 08:20 and so on till 09:00. The following statements can be deducted from Figs. 5 and 6 : \u2022 The DCU reaches around 70% for small labs and roughly 90% for big labs respectively in the \u2018normal\u2019 working hours between 08:00 and 16:00o\u2019clock on workdays, see also Fig. 5 for detailed hourly occupancy profiles. That reveals a higher potential for optimized, i.e. demand-controlled room conditioning for smaller (<1000 m3/h), although less energy-consuming, lab infrastructure. \u2022 Times with virtually no presence for heavily reduced room conditioning can be clearly identified, that is: Mo \u2013 Fr, 00:00 to 06:00 and Sa \u2013 Su, 00:00 to 07:00. \u2022 Profiles for weekends (in regular time periods) show significantly reduced activity, albeit the sensors register a maximum DCU of around 20% on Saturdays and 10% on Sundays, providing a more solid basis for argumentation concerning frequently and controversially discussed \u2018fixed AHU-shutting-off\u2019s on weekends. Hereby, it is to mention, that scientific personnel do have fully flexible time management. In industrial laboratories with fixed working schedules, occupancy is supposed to be lower on weekends and during nighttime too. To proof this hypothesis further research would be necessary. \u2022 Concerning TCP schedules, attention must be paid to the fact, that noticeably reductions of air supply, e.g. through reset main duct pressure, should be carried out with caution in the evening, preferably starting not before 22:00o\u2019 clock on workdays. In order to analyze the DCU/occupancy activity in more detail, mean hourly occupancy profiles have been established from all available PIR-data for big labs in the given overall time period from 19th of October 2020 till 15th of November 2020, see Fig. 5. As depicted, these include averaged \u2018occupancy density functions\u2019 for typical workdays (solid blue), Saturdays (solid light blue) and Sundays (dashed light blue). For comparative reasons, the Time Control Program (TCP)setting, namely constant regular duct pressure control on workdays from 06:00am till 8:00 pm with preset VAV-boxes operating in \u2018Comfort\u2019-mode is also plotted. In other words, with no PIR sensors installed/active, the individual room-control i.e. the control of the VAV-terminal boxes is time-preset to \u2018Comfort\u2019-mode assuming a DCU of 100% in the labs (dotted red). As can be seen in Fig. 5, the potential for reduction in air volume flow stems from the resulting \u2018gap\u2019 between the actual measured occupancy density function for workdays and the FTP-assumed DCU of 100% (red dotted curve). Hereby, the difference between the FTP-curve and the occupancy density function for each point in time stands for the number (in percentage of all PIR-equipped labs) of big laboratory rooms that are currently operated in PIR-triggered \u2018ECO\u2019-mode, thus saving electrical and thermal energy at the AHU\u2019s. On workdays, it is evident, that the lowest savings are achieved between 09:00 and 16:00o\u2019clock when the DCU reaches between 80% and 90%. On the other hand, biggest savings are achievable in the time period before 09:00 and after 16:00o\u2019clock, when the gap between the PIR-triggered- and the TCP-induced air control becomes significantly bigger. These differences, that are highly relevant for all potential design calculations as well as for the critical evaluation of the underlying project, are further analyzed in the following section. Other interesting results, that can be extracted from Fig. 5, include the very low number of switching errors of the installed PIR sensors (i.e. a DCU of nearly 0% in the time from 00:00 to 06:00o\u2019clock) and the (at least for the authors) surprisingly high DCU\u2019s of between 10 and 20% on the weekend. As mentioned before, this observation is highly relevant for all current/future demand-dependent air control strategies, when it comes to estimating/defining the occupancy pattern on Saturdays and Sundays in big labs. It has to be mentioned that the results in all figures, displaying occupancy data, are based on the initial time-delay setting of 60 Min. at all PIR sensors. After the commissioning phase these values are intended to be further adjusted in detail according to user-specific requirements and -feedback thus potentially revealing an additional 3 to 10%-increase in daily \u2018ECO\u2019-mode operation of the VAV boxes, see also subsequent figures in the results chapter. As stated before, the occupancy profiles/patterns, separated into three different operational time periods, can serve as solid data basis for occupancy figures during the whole year when planning/establishing occupancy-based HVAC-control strategies for commercial buildings with focus on R&D in laboratory infrastructure. In order to provide a more detailed \u2018insight\u2019 into the presented occupancy figures, the following boxplots\u2019 intention is to analyze and shortly point out the achievable increase in \u2018Eco\u2019-mode operation (quasi reduction in \u2018Comfort\u2019-mode operation) of the VAV terminal boxes due to the installed PIR sensors. 7 Evaluation of PIR-triggered \u2018ECO\u2019-mode operation (of VAV boxes) 7.1 Exemplary graphs for \u2018regular\u2019 time period: 19.10.2020 \u2013 15.11.2020 According to the previously active fixed time control program, the VAV boxes has been set to continuous \u2018Comfort\u2019-mode operation on workdays (Mo-Fr) from 06:00o\u2019clock till 20:00o\u2019 clock in the evening, which accounts to 70 h (42%) in \u2018Comfort\u2019-mode and 98 h (58%) in \u2018Eco\u2019-mode operation for a whole week. The following Fig. 6 shows a boxplot of the evaluated, PIR-triggered \u2018Comfort\u2019-mode operation of all VAV boxes for the above referenced time period. As can be seen in Fig. 6, the Median for all labs now accounts for 26%, which represents an increase in \u2018Eco\u2019-mode of 18%. The interquartile range accounts for 12% and, together with the Median, represents a quite neutral distribution of all lab data. Variance is far more significant with the small labs as is the achieved increase in \u2018Eco\u2019-mode operation as predicted/stated before. The boxplot for big labs again shows a rather low variance and together with the Median of 28% represents a slightly right-skewed data distribution. Completing the boxplot-analysis for all labs are the minimum and maximum values of 3% and and 49% respectively. 7.2 Economic evaluation With purposefully installed electricity meters directly monitoring energy usage of all AHU\u2019s, it is very comfortable to immediately register changes/measure-consequences and analyze resulting reductions in energy consumption, albeit the achievable thermal energy savings are still not directly \u2018accessible\u2019 due to only few installed thermal meters, which do not cover thermal energy usage of the AHU\u2019s directly. The reference time period for the electricity consumption has been chosen carefully, including not only the whole year 2019, but also the time period January \u2013 September of the year 2020 (\u2018COVID19\u2032-impact), thus establishing a solid and comprehensible benchmark for the energy savings\u2019 evaluation. \u2018Optimized\u2019 energy data after installment of the PIR sensors have been thoroughly evaluated in the time period 11.2020 till 09.2021. As can be seen in Fig. 7 , the weekly electricity consumption is being reduced from initial 15,4 MWh in the reference period down to 12,7 MWh in the evaluated/optimized time period. This accounts to savings of 17,7% in (sole) electrical energy consumption, which equals to 142 MWhel annually. Additionally, one has to consider a reasonable AHU-reduction in thermal energy as well, realistically reaching figures of up to −15% according to previous measurements, see e.g. [1]. Taken into account a variable electricity price of 105,3 \u20ac/MWh (specific target price for BOKU), this accounts to 14.953,- \u20ac electricity cost savings per year. The same approximation for thermal energy reduction, that was used for the calculations of the energy cost savings potential, has been applied once again. This yields thermal energy cost savings of around 5.500,- \u20ac/a (heating- + cooling energy with specific target prices for BOKU). Together, this accounts for roughly 20.500,- \u20ac/a in overall energy cost savings annually. Referring to table 5, this results in a payback period of around 2,6 years. Further optimization potential lies in the \u2018fine-tuning\u2019 of the sensor time-delay settings and can be achieved through detailed analysis of the PIR activity data and corresponding user preferences of every single laboratory room. This momentarily ongoing procedure is rather time-consuming and involves several feedback loops in order to optimize ECO-time duration on workdays but not compromise user comfort. 8 Conclusions and outlook: The final Table 6 shows a conclusive assessment of the PIR-triggered occupancy-based HVAC control in laboratories of the university laboratory building and can be used as a preliminary guide for considerations/strategic planning of the examined energy efficiency measures in other non-domestic buildings. As can be seen, the table evaluates critical BACS-requirements and air control preconditions, thus allowing to assess the potential of PIR-triggered OBC in other, similar buildings. As far as the authors\u2019 experience goes, the following aspects have been crucial in successfully implementing the OBC system in our university building and should be considered carefully prior to any detailed economy calculations for other non-domestic buildings: \u2022 Average to low or at least heavily irregular degree of utilization (by means of physical presence) for the spatial infrastructure to be equipped with PIR-triggered OBC (e.g. that virtually excludes typical, regularly used office- as well as intensively used teaching/seminar rooms etc.) \u2022 Medium to high (>6h−1) air exchange rates for the considered spatial infrastructure \u2022 Specific installed AHU-fan capacity values of ∼ 5 kWel/100 m2 of the conditioned area (likely to enhance payback periods) The project economy and return of investment-potential of such an energy-efficiency measure certainly depend on many factors, the most important ones being pointed out in Table 6. Costs for sensors and auxiliary equipment as well as installation- and commissioning costs are certainly, albeit not heavily dependent on sensor quantity or rather project dimensions. Thus, economies of scale are not easily exploited concerning this specific energy efficiency measure. Of course, further potential lies within the individuals-counting OBC as already proposed and examined by many authors. However, sensor complexity, -costs, -requirements for data processing etc. are then increasing rapidly, when it comes to the possibility of exactly and reliably counting individuals in rooms. Furthermore, dependable- and very reliable information concerning the specific usage of different (laboratory) rooms must be readily at hand, when trying to implement an all-time modulating operation of the VAV terminal boxes. Specific minimum-, maximum- and individual-dependent air volume flow settings are then becoming necessary, which are often not easily established. Concerning bespoken individualized air rate control in labs, a further energy efficiency optimization measure has to be mentioned: variable duct pressure setback in terms of fan load control by the weakest VAV box (i.e.: highest damper opening) of the respective AHU. Such fan-/AHU-control options should be highly considered when it comes to optimized, highly demand-dependent, energy efficient control mechanisms for HVAC systems. Future work at the Institute for Chemical and Energy Engineering at BOKU will also focus on progress and newly evaluated practical studies concerning the above-mentioned fan -control option.

In this work the holistic integration of passive infrared (PIR) motion detectors for controlling variable air volume systems in a laboratory (R&D) building is presented. In total, 72 laboratories were equipped with PIR motion detectors. Their operation and activity have been monitored for several months. Average occupancy/Degree of Capacity Utilization (DCU) in big labs was found to be at maximum 90% during a normal working day whereas in small labs, this number decreases to approximately 70%. On weekends occupancy/DCU was higher than expected, reaching values between 10% and 20%. Compared to a typical fixed time program or Time Control Program (TCP), PIR-triggered occupancy-based air control yields savings of up to 18 % in electricity consumption for the scientifically evaluated time period 11.2020 \u2013 09.2021. The economic evaluation for the investigated energy-efficiency measure stated a payback period of less than three years.",
