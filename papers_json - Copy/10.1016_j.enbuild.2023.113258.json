The dynamic optimization of key setpoints (e.g., supply water temperatures of chillers and cooling towers, or indoor temperature and humidity) can track the efficient performance point of the air-conditioning system (ACS), thus obtaining a great energy-saving effect. The model predictive control is an effective way to precisely adjust these setpoints. However, most of the existing studies focused on simple linear strategies, e.g., experience-based, rule-based, or component-based, which results in unsatisfactory energy efficiency. Aiming at this, the paper proposed a novel machine learning-based model predictive control (MLB-MPC) framework with predictive inputs of disturbances. The framework first employed the grid search and cross-validation to optimize the total energy consumption prediction models (TECPMs), which were built by data-driven models (e.g., multiple linear regression, artificial neural network, support vector regression (SVR), and random forest). And then the optimization performances of each TECPM to the controlled variables were obtained by using different optimization algorithms (e.g., genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization (PSO), and simulated annealing). Finally, the optimal match of TECPMs and optimization algorithms was achieved by trade-off among prediction accuracies, optimization accuracies, and optimization time. The case studies demonstrated that the optimal match for the MLB-MPC is SVR and PSO as they had the highest prediction accuracy (mean absolute percentage error of 2.5%) and shortest optimization time (41 ms/per) and optimization accuracies with little difference. After adopting the optimal match, the MLB-MPC with predictive disturbing inputs achieved a great energy-saving ratio of 7.1% for the ACS, which was only less than the MLB-MPC with ideal disturbing inputs by 0.4%. This indicated that exact predictions of disturbances (e.g., cooling load and outdoor wet-bulb temperature) are important for the MLB-MPC. The proposed MLB-MPC framework would provide a method for improving the energy efficiency of ACSs.

In order to realize the aim of energy conservation and emission reduction better and faster, the Chinese government proposed a commitment to achieving the carbon peak and carbon neutrality in 2030 and 2060, respectively [2]. In this process, efficient operation of the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems plays a key role in buildings\u2019 energy-saving. Apart from configuring efficient equipment, the optimization control of HVACs is the most effective way to dig the energy-saving potential over the system\u2019s operation stage [3,4]. Of which, the model predictive control (MPC) has the best technical prospects for improving operation efficiency [5\u20138]. For example, the main setpoints (i.e., controlled variables) of the system\u2019s local components are dynamically adjusted through the supervisory-level MPC optimizer to ensure holistic operation with maximum efficiency, while satisfying indoor thermal comfort and air quality [6,9,10]. A complete MPC is commonly composed of prediction models and optimization algorithms. The physical behavior of HVACs is first described by prediction models (e.g., white-box, black-box, or grey-box models), which is the most critical portion of MPCs [5,9,11]. And then, the prediction model (e.g., energy consumption prediction model, ECPM), as an objective function, is optimized by optimization algorithms to reap the optimal setpoints with minimum energy consumption [12]. The optimization procedure is performed over each time step and constrained by users\u2019 load requirement and weather conditions (e.g., outdoor wet-bulb temperature, Twet ), so this process is also called rolling optimization [5,13]. 1.1 Review of relevant literature Conventional supervisory-level controls of air-conditioning systems (ACSs) generally use fixed setpoints or variable setpoints with linearity. For example, the chilled water supply temperature (Tchws ) of chillers is set as 7℃ and the cooling water supply temperature (Tcws ) of cooling towers takes a fixed degree of approximation (e.g., 4℃) or variable Tchws based on cooling load ratio, etc. Although these experience-based fixed setpoints or rule-based variable setpoints ensure indoor thermal comfort in most situations, the invariable setpoints or linearly variable setpoints are difficult to track the dynamic point with optimal performances [8,14,15]. That is because an ACS is made up of complex nonlinear components, e.g., chillers, cooling towers, water pumps, fans, etc, thus the system\u2019s energy consumption model is generally nonlinear or even nonconvex [5]. For instance, raising Tchws is beneficial to the energy decrease of chillers, but it may increase the energy consumption of user-side fans and chilled pumps largely. Moreover, weather parameters and indoor cooling loads are shifty with time, so it is essential to trade off the energy consumption of all components by adjusting the setpoints dynamically to achieve global optimal efficiency [5,13,14]. With the development of building automation systems, the operation data of ACSs get easier to access. Therefore, using data-driven modeling methods to express the behavior of ACSs accurately becomes possible [16]. Besides the good accuracy, data-driven models rely on less domain knowledge [5]. For example, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are able to self-adapt to a complex-nonlinear physics process by optimizing their network structure and hyper-parameters, and they only need to focus on the models\u2019 inputs and outputs (i.e., feature engineering) [17,18]. However, traditional optimization methods (e.g., gradient-based, enumeration-based, derivation-based, etc) are hard to solve global optimal solutions of the energy consumption model with properties of nonlinear and nonconvex [4,8]. Fortunately, heuristic optimization algorithms, e.g., genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), simulated annealing (SA), etc, are capable of tackling this global optimization problem [16,19\u201322]. Hence, the data-driven models and heuristic optimization algorithms can provide a strong engine for the MPC of ACSs. In up-to-date studies of MPCs, Ma and Wang [11] developed a MPC framework to optimize central chiller plants. They adopted an adaptive linear model that was realized via the rolling training with exponential forgetting as the prediction model, and the GA was used as a global optimizer. The case study showed that the MPC strategy can save about 0.73%-2.55% of energy consumption when compared with the conventional setting method. Wang et al., [5] proposed an optimization method for chiller plants based on the cooling load prediction. ANNs were used to model the cooling towers, chillers, and pumps by employing the white-box modeling method. The GA was selected as the optimization algorithm. The chiller plant\u2019s optimized variables (i.e., controlled parameters) were the water supply temperature and mass flow rate of cooling towers and chillers. Compared to other MPCs, the most significant feature of this approach is that the optimization goal was aimed at the future total energy of two-step-ahead, which thus achieved a reduction of 80% in redundant energy consumption. Wei et al., [4] adopted a multi-layer perceptron to model a chiller plant and developed a two-level intelligent algorithm used as the optimizer that was a combination of GA and PSO. The optimized variable was cooling water supply temperature. The results indicated that a 14% energy saving can be obtained. Sun [8] used a heuristic search sequential quadratic programming to achieve the optimal setpoints of a chiller plant, where the chiller plant\u2019s model was established by the grey-box modeling. However, the above literature almost focused on the optimization of chiller plants while less on the whole ACS\u2019s energy consumption, which results in unsatisfactory energy efficiency. Besides, Sha et al., [23] realized an optimal control based on cooling load prediction, which was used in high-rise buildings with mechanical ventilative cooling. Nine different machine learning-based models were first utilized to predict the building\u2019s cooling load and then a linear modeling method was used to build the energy consumption models of chillers, cooling towers, pumps, and fans, respectively. Lastly, the supplied fresh airflow rate was selected as an optimized variable and an exhaustive search algorithm was employed as the optimizer. The case demonstrated that the system achieved a 16% reduction in energy consumption during the summer. Wang et al., [6] quantificationally studied the impact of uncertainties on the MPC\u2019s performance of a hybrid cooling system in the data center, where the uncertainties are derived from models, sensors, and actuators, respectively. The research suggested that the control performance can be greatly improved by reducing the uncertainties in systems. Zhang et al., [24] adopted a new electric water chiller as a study case to reevaluate the eight typical chiller models (i.e., empirical models), and then the models\u2019 performances were compared from the manufacturer laboratory data to the on-site operation data. The results showed that the existing models can well express the chiller behavior in the laboratory test but poorly perform in the on-site operation situation. Huang et al., [13] developed a new approach to ameliorate the chiller\u2019s sequencing control performances based on cooling load, where the research contents included the optimal load distribution and the operation number of chillers, and the holistic solution coupling the first two approaches. The results showed that a total energy saving of 0.5\u20135.6% can be achieved for the chiller plant. Nevertheless, these publications did not take into account the optimal match of prediction models and optimization algorithms, which would result in unsatisfactory performances for MPCs. 1.2 Research gaps From the above discussion, it can be seen that the prediction accuracies of models (e.g., energy consumption model) and the global solving ability of optimization algorithms are key to achieving the MPC successfully. Moreover, the trade-off among the prediction accuracies, optimization accuracies, and optimization times is also important for the MPC, because the optimized time-step is usually limited in practical engineering (e.g., less than 10 min) [1,6,9]. Although many publications have focused on the MPC, there are still some limitations in the existing literature: \u2022 Most of the prediction models of MPCs were linear or poorly nonlinear, e.g., multiple regression models, experience-based theory models, grey-box models, etc [6,9,25,26]. However, the complex-nonlinear physics behavior of ACSs is difficult to be accurately described by using these models. \u2022 Lack of a holistic optimization framework in MPCs. On the one hand, the optimization and comparison of prediction models are lacking. However, the same type of model may present a large difference in prediction performance, e.g., overfitting or underfitting will happen when hyperparameters of models (e.g., ANNs) are not reasonable [1,27]; On the other hand, studies on the matching of prediction models and optimization algorithms are insufficient. Although some complex models have a high prediction accuracy, their optimal solutions of optimized variables may be difficult to obtain [8]. Hence, exceedingly pursuing the prediction accuracy of models is unwise sometimes [6,27]. \u2022 The existing methods mostly focused on component-level modeling while less on system-level modeling [6,8,9,28]. A system-level model can be easily composed of component-level models, e.g., the total energy consumption model of an ACS can be made up of chiller models, cooling tower models, pump models, fan models, etc [5]. But multiple component-level modelings are redundant work because the information with high correlation or overlap exists in the series components, e.g., the cooling water\u2019s outlet of cooling towers is the cooling water\u2019s inlet of chillers, thus the series models have the same input variables. Furthermore, a larger error will happen in the system-level model as a result of the error accumulation of component-level models. 1.3 Main contributions Aiming at the above limitations in the available literature, this paper proposed a novel machine learning-based model predictive control (MLB-MPC) framework with predictive inputs of disturbing factors, which has these novelties as follows: \u2022 From the perspective of system-level modeling, the total energy consumption prediction model (TECPM) of ACSs was built via machine learning-based methods. Which would make the modeling process more concise and efficient. \u2022 The optimization and comparison of prediction models were implemented by using the grid search and cross-validation methods. Hence, the optimized models were more matched with the training data and obtained a great improvement in generalization ability. \u2022 The matching between the different prediction models and the various optimization algorithms was investigated. And the optimal match was obtained based on the trade-off among prediction accuracies, optimization accuracies, and optimization times. This optimal match can greatly improve the performance of the MLB-MPC. \u2022 Based on one-step-ahead predictions of the cooling load and outdoor wet-bulb temperature (i.e., disturbing variables), the Tchws and Tcws of a chiller plant were optimized over each step based on the TECPM. Which made the proposed MLB-MPC framework more in line with the actual engineering applications. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives the main methodologies including prediction models and their hyperparameters\u2019 optimization, optimization algorithms, rolling optimization, and a novel MLB-MPC framework, etc. Section 3 gives the validation and case studies of the MLB-MPC. Sections 4 and 5 give the discussion and conclusion of this paper, respectively. 2 Methodology 2.1 A novel machine learning-based model predictive control framework A novel machine learning-based model predictive control (MLB-MPC) framework for improving the operating efficiency of ACSs is shown in Fig. 1 . As can be seen, the framework can be divided into two parts. Part 1 is the optimal match of total energy consumption prediction models (TECPMs) and optimization algorithms, where the optimization of energy consumption would simultaneously take into account a chiller plant and user-sider fans; Part 2 is a specific application of the proposed MLB-MPC in Part 1. Firstly, the feature engineering of TECPMs is carried out via sensitivity analysis to determine the model variables, which usually include controlled variables (e.g., Tchws and Tcws ), disturbing variables (e.g., CL and Twet ), and output variables (e.g., the ACS\u2019s total power, P); And then, the historical operation data of these variables are taken as training data for TECPMs, after preprocessing (e.g., removed outliers and normalization); Secondly, the data-driven models (e.g., multiple linear regression (MLR), ANN, support vector regression (SVR), and random forest (RF)) are chosen as the TECPMs; Thirdly, the hyperparameters and structure of these TECPMs are optimized by using the grid search and cross-validation methods and then each the optimal TECPM would be obtained. Besides, the optimization performances (e.g, optimization accuracy and optimization time) of different optimization algorithms (e.g., GA, PSO, and SA) to the TECPMs are evaluated; Fourthly, the optimal match of TECPMs and optimization algorithms would be achieved by the trade-off among prediction accuracies, optimization accuracies, and optimization time; Lastly, the predicted disturbing variables (e.g., CL and Twet ) are inputted in the optimal TECPM, which is treated as the objective function, and then the controlled variables (e.g., Tchws and Tcws ) with optimal energy efficiency for the ACS can be obtained by rolling optimization. Note that the optimization ranges of controlled variables (i.e., feasible region) are constrained by actual physical conditions and thermal comfort, such as the lower limit of Tcws is not larger than outdoor wet-bulb temperature and the cooling capacity is required to meet the user-side demands. The objective function (i.e., TECPM) and its feasible region of an ACS are shown in Eq. (1). Where TECPM(t) represents a mean value of the system\u2019s total energy consumption during t to t + Δt, kW; Tchws, min and Tchws, max are optimized boundaries of chilled water supply temperature of chillers, ℃; Tcws, max is the maximum value of cooling water supply temperature of cooling towers, ℃; dTapp, min is the minimum degree of approximation of cooling towers (e.g., generally taken as 1℃) [29]. Note that these optimized boundaries are constrained by the capacity of a chiller plant, the demands of user-siders, and the weather conditions [6]. A detailed description will be presented in the case studies. (1) minimize T chws , T cws T E C P M t = f T chws t , T cws t , T wet t , C L t s . t .

It can be seen that the controlled variables (i.e., Tchws and Tcws ) in the TECPM are dynamically optimized via the optimizer (e.g., GA, PSO, or SA) over each time step [30]. In addition, the MLB-MPC uses the prediction values of disturbing variables (i.e., CL and Twet ) as the inputs of TECPM, which would be more in line with practical engineering applications [5]. Finally, the global minimum energy consumption of the system would be achieved by using the rolling optimization method [9,13]. 2.2 Machine learning-based prediction models The machine learning-based prediction models are adopted for describing the physical behavior of systems. From the perspective of machine learning-based modeling, it can be divided into regression analysis (RA), ANN, SVR, and RF. 2.2.1 Regression analysis The RA model [1,27,31,32], as shown in Fig. 3 , is one of the most basic machine learning models, which is derived from classical statistics and has the simplest structure (e.g., MLR models). The RA can obtain an acceptable accuracy when predicted samples display a linear relation. Where xi is the ith input variable of the RA; yp is the model\u2019s prediction value; wi is the weight coefficient of the ith input variable, which can be solved by the least square method shown in Eq. (2). Where the capital W and X are a weight coefficient vector and a matrix consisted of training samples, respectively; Ya is a vector composed of the actual value of yp . (2) W = ( X T ∙ X ) - 1 ∙ X T ∙ Y a Note that the RA is capable of describing not only a linear relation but also a nonlinear relation according to its input types [27]. For instance, to make the RA display nonlinearity, the input variable x1 can be changed to x 1 2 or x 1 ▪ x 2 or x 1 2 ▪ x 2, etc, namely the input variables after being changed need to have a nonlinear relationship with the single x 1. Besides, to decrease the redundant inputs of models as well as avoid overfitting, Pearson correlation analysis [27,33] shown in Eq. (3) is performed between the input variables and output variables. (3) ρ xy = ∑ i = 1 n x - x ¯ y - y ¯ ∑ i = 1 n x - x ¯ 2 ∑ i = 1 n y - y ¯ 2 where ρx,y presents a degree of linear correlation between x and y. The variables of models with high correlation should be regarded as redundant variables. 2.2.2 Artificial neural network The ANN model [18,34\u201338] is the most popular technology in machine learning, which simulates the connection structure of the neural network of a human brain. Owing to nonlinear activation functions existing in the ANN\u2019s neurons, it is thus able to approximate any complicated functions with arbitrary accuracy when it only has three layers with adequate hidden nodes. When the structure and activation function of the ANN is selected appropriately, it has not only high fitting accuracy but also a strong generalization ability. Fig. 4 gives a three-layer structure of an ANN. Note that the inputs and outputs of the model are required to be normalized and the final output values also need to be anti-normalized, which normalized process can well prevent numerical problems. In Fig. 4, vij is the weight of input layer node i corresponding to the hidden layer node j; aj is the threshold of the hidden layer node j; wj is the weight of the hidden layer node j to the output layer node yp ; b is the threshold of the output layer node yp ; A bipolar S-shape function shown in Eq. (4) is adopted as the activation function of the ANN\u2019s neurons [1]. (4) f u = 2 1 + e - u - 1 Eq. (5) is the loss function E for training the ANN network [1,27]. Where yp,i and ya,i are the fitted value and the actual value of the training sample i, respectively; n is the total number of training samples. Note that optimized parameters (e.g., weights and thresholds) in the loss function E are achieved by stochastic gradient descent. (5) E = 1 2 ∑ i = 1 n y p , i - y a , i 2 2.2.3 Support vector regression The SVR model [35,39\u201341], based on the minimization principle of structural risk, is one of the most prevalent prediction technologies following ANNs. This is because the SVR has a strong generalization ability, especially in few-shot learning (i.e., small sample learning). As shown in Fig. 5 , the SVR reaps a good generalization performance by optimizing the size of soft margin ε, as well as obtains a high nonlinear fitting accuracy via allowing the input variables x mapped to the nonlinear space with the nonlinear function φ(x). Note that in Fig. 5, the fitted biases of yellow points falling within the soft margin (shaded area) are not calculated, which is opposite to the red points (falling outside), which is thus the main characteristic of the SVR as compared with other modeling technologies. In Fig. 5, f(x) is the expression of the SVR. Where x is a vector composed of input variables; w is the weight vector of the vector function φ(x); b is the bias of the model. The loss function as shown in Eq. (6), is used to solve the parameters w and b of the SVR. (6) minimize w , b 1 2 \u2016 w \u2016 2 + C 1 n ∑ i = 1 n L y i , f x i L y i , f x i = 0 , i f y i - f x i ≤ ε ; y i - f x i - ε , o t h e r w i s e Where the left item of the loss function is a regularization item, which considers the model\u2019s structure complexity to prevent overfitting; The right item is a training error item, which takes into account the fitted accuracies to avoid underfitting; C is the penalty factor for balancing the prediction accuracy and the training accuracy; ε is the insensitive loss of the soft margin. It is noteworthy that the solution of the loss function of the SVR is a problem of convex quadratic programming, which is further required to convert to a dual problem by using the Lagrange method [42]. 2.2.4 Random forest The RF model [43\u201348], as shown in Fig. 6 , is one of the most popular prediction algorithms used in ensemble learning, which is made up of multiple decision trees with discrepancies. The RF has stronger robustness than the single decision tree as a result of integrating prediction results of multiple weak learners (i.e., decision trees). Compared with other ensemble learning approaches, there are two stochastic processes in the RF and thus become the biggest characteristic of the model. The first one is the training data selected randomly, and the second one is the features selected randomly in each decision tree. In other words, the training samples of each decision tree are chosen randomly from the original data with a putback process (i.e., bootstrap sampling method), and in each decision tree, the attributes of each node used for the decision are selected randomly. Thereby, owing to these two random features, the RF has excellent prediction performance. In Fig. 6, m is the number of training samples; k is the random features selected in the available features d; yp is the model\u2019s prediction value obtained by the arithmetic mean; yp,i is the prediction value of the ith decision tree. 2.3 Optimization and evaluation of models\u2019 hyperparameters 2.3.1 Grid search and cross-validation The prediction performances of data-driven models rely on their hyperparameters and model structure, thus the selection of hyperparameters is of great significance to the optimization and comparison of models [23]. However, it is difficult for models to choose suitable hyperparameters by experience, which is because different application scenarios have different optimal hyperparameters. Hence, an efficient grid search method can well tackle this problem [49,50]. As shown in Fig. 7 , the grid search takes a point as the representative of the grid with a certain size so that the search scope can be decreased largely. It is noteworthy that each grid\u2019s validation is required to implement the cross-validation process [51\u201353]. Fig. 8 is the schematic diagram of 10-fold cross-validation. As can be seen that the data set of samples is first divided into 10 equal portions, including nine training sets and one test set. Among them, each data set will become the test set with one chance. It is easy to know that the model performance on the available training samples is evaluated by 10 times through 10-fold cross-validation. Thus, cross-validation ensures preciseness in the comparisons of models. 2.3.2 Evaluation indices of models\u2019 prediction accuracy The absolute percentage error (APE, %), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE, %), and root mean squared error (RMSE) are chosen as the metrics to evaluate the prediction performances of data-driven models, which are given in Eqs. (7) - (9), respectively [1,27]. (7) APE i = y p , i - y a , i y a , i × 100 % (8) MAPE = 1 n ∑ i = 1 n APE i (9) RMSE = ∑ i = 1 n y p , i - y a , i 2 n where the subscripts p and a represent a prediction value and an actual value of the ith sample y, respectively; n is the total number of samples. 2.4 Optimization algorithms for searching optimal values of controlled variables From the above analysis, it can be seen that the objective function TECPM(t) is a complex nonlinear function even with a property of nonconvex [4,34,54] because an ACS consists of various nonlinear energy-consumption components. Hence, conventional optimization methods such as analytical solutions are hard to settle this optimal problem. Fortunately, the numerical optimization methods are capable of tackling this issue and can obtain an optimal solution accurately [5]. In this paper, the intelligence algorithms, namely GA, PSO, and SA, are adopted as optimizers, respectively. Note that, for the paper\u2019s concision, here only introduces the GA algorithm, while the PSO and SA algorithms are presented in the Appendix. The GA [11,18,21] algorithm, as a global optimization method, is easily implemented, which simulates the evolutionary process of selection, crossover (i.e., mating), and mutation of a biological population. The workflow of the GA is shown in Fig. 9 . As can be seen, a population is first generated, which is made up of encoded n initial individuals xi (i.e., feasible solution vectors) and then the fitness function E(xi ) (i.e., objective function) at each xi is calculated; Secondly, the survival probability Pi of each individual is calculated according to the E(xi ). Note that the larger E(xi ), the smaller Pi will be, which is because of the E(xi ) with the aim of minimum energy consumption; Thirdly, the n parents x1,i are selected based on the roulette wheel selection, and then their n descendants x2,i are yielded through the genetic crossover; Finally, the mutation of x2,i is taken place randomly with a small probability. It should be noted that the optimal solution xi and E(xi ) will be achieved when the stopping criteria are satisfied (e.g., reaching the maximum iterations or little change in the fitness function). From the above analysis, we can see that the GA can obtain a local optimal result by the process of selection and crossover, while the global optimal solution will be obtained via introducing the random mutation process. 3 Case studies The case studies are divided into three parts, including the model validations based on measured operation data in Part 1, the trade-off between prediction accuracies and optimization performances in Part 2, and the optimized effect of using MLB-MPC with inputs of predicted disturbances in Part 3. The last two cases are application examples of the validated models through Part 1. The case studies were implemented by Matlab 2020b software and the performances of the adopted computer are shown in Table 1 . 3.1 Part 1: Model validations based on field data 3.1.1 Description and preprocessing of the raw data 1) Description of the raw data The original data were monitored at the Jiahewanggang subway station in Guangzhou, China, which was served in 2010 and is the first cross-platform interchange station of Guangzhou Metro. The interchange station is located in the underground space, and the diagram of the station is shown in Fig. 10 . The samples of operation data were collected at an interval of 10 min, and implemented for two weeks in the cooling season. The outdoor dry-bulb temperature and relative humidity of the metro station on time series are shown in Fig. 11 . It can be seen that the weather in Guangzhou varied significantly over a day or several days. It should be pointed out that the impact of weather parameters on the indoor cooling load is weaker as the station is in deep underground space. The primary effect of the weather is on the cooling water supply temperature of the cooling towers and the fresh air cooling load, thus the dry-bulb temperature and relative humidity need to be transformed into the wet-bulb temperature. The distribution of energy consumption of the ACS (including the chiller plant and the user sides) in the station is shown in Fig. 12 . It can be seen that the maximum proportion of total energy consumption is the chiller plant, which is up to 73.01%, including 57.20% of the chillers, 7.44% of the cooling water pumps, 4.70% of the chilled water pumps, and 3.67% of the cooling towers. Among the main energy-consumption components, the user-sider fans share a big percentage of 26.99%. Therefore, the key to energy saving for the ACS is to coordinate the operation of main components from a holistic perspective. 2) Preprocessing of the raw data To decrease the impact of data noises on the training of models, outliers on the raw data need to be removed [55]. The outliers generally contain the zero values produced due to the cutoff of equipment and the extreme values as a result of anomalies in components. Among them, the extreme values can be detected via the interquartile range (IQR) criteria, which are shown in Eq. (10) and Eq. (11). (10) x min = Q 1 - 1.5 × ( Q 3 - Q 1 ) (11) x max = Q 3 + 1.5 × ( Q 3 - Q 1 ) where xmin and xmax represent the maximum and the minimum of training samples, respectively; Q 1 and Q 3 represent the first quartile value and the third quartile value of training samples, respectively. The data need to be normalized (e.g., range from −1 to 1) to avoid numerical problems in the computational process [1], which normalization is shown in Eq. (12). Note that the model\u2019s output values need to be anti-normalized when the prediction is completed. (12) x = 2 × x - x min x max - x min - 1 In the end, the total number of raw data after preprocessing is 1466 samples, which is sufficient for training and validating the models. 3.1.2 Determination of the variables in the total energy consumption prediction model The key controlled variables of the ACS are the chilled water supply temperature Tchws of chillers and the cooling water supply temperature Tcws of cooling towers [5]. The disturbing variables are the cooling load CL and the outdoor wet-bulb temperature Twet , which impact the operation of the system [13]. Thus, the main input variables affecting the output energy consumption Phavc are Tchws , Tcws , CL, and Twet. The inputs and outputs of the TECPM and statistical features of the raw data after removing outliers are given in Table 2 . To guarantee the generalization ability of the TECPM, the optimized boundaries of controlled variables were determined via the measured operation data, e.g., the boundaries are not allowed to exceed the extreme values of the measured data overmuch and must obey actual physical conditions. For instance, the lower limit of the optimized cooling water supply temperature Tcws must be larger than the outdoor wet-bulb temperature Tweb . Therefore, from Table 2, the optimized scopes of Tcws and Tchws can be set as [T wet(i) + 1, 31] and [9, 12], respectively. Where i denotes the ith optimized time step in the rolling optimization. Moreover, to ensure the prediction accuracy of the TECPM and prevent the impact of data noises on the model, the relationship between inputs and outputs was analyzed by Pearson correlation coefficients [27], as shown in Fig. 13 . It can be seen that all input variables (i.e., Tchws , Tcws , Twet , and CL) have a great contribution (the minimum is 0.56) to the output variable P. Thus, these input variables introduced into the TECPM can well guarantee the prediction accuracy of the model. It can be also seen from Fig. 13 that the largest impact on the Tcws of cooling towers is the Twet because their Pearson value is up to 0.97, which illustrates that the vital influence factor of cooling towers is the Twet . 3.1.3 Validations and comparisons of the total energy consumption prediction models To select a suitable model for predicting the energy consumption of the ACS accurately, the optimization and comparison of the TECPMs are of great significance. Therefore, the first thing is to search for the optimal hyperparameters and suitable structures for the TECPMs. The grid search and 10-fold cross-validation method were adopted in this process, and the searched ranges of hyperparameters are given in Table 3 . It should be pointed out that there are no hyperparameters needed to optimize for the MLR as a result of this model with the simplest structure as compared to the other complex models (i.e., ANN, SVR, and RF). The prediction accuracies of optimized TECPMs and their corresponding optimal hyperparameters are displayed in Table 4 . It can be seen that the SVR has the optimal prediction performance and its MAPE and RMSE are as low as 2.51% and 12.28 kW, respectively. The MLR has the worst prediction accuracy as a result of its poor nonlinear fitting ability. The RF is a little better than the ANN on prediction performances. Overall, the prediction accuracies of all the models after being optimized are satisfactory to engineering applications. The fitting accuracies of different TECPMs are shown in Fig. 14 . It can be observed that the models from the best to the worst according to the fitting accuracies are SVR, RF, ANN, and MLR (e.g., RMSEs of 10.69 kW, 10.93 kW, 12.35 kW, and 17.91 kW, respectively). It can be also seen that the ranking of the fitting performances of the models is the same as the above ranking of the prediction performance. The fitting effect of various TECPMs is presented in Fig. 15 . It demonstrates that all the models after being optimized can express the measured samples well. In summary, the optimal model for predicting the total energy consumption of the ACS is the SVR whether in terms of the prediction accuracies or the fitting accuracies. 3.2 Part 2: Trade-off between prediction accuracies and optimization performances Although the more accurate models the better performances will be, the more accurate models may significantly increase the optimization time (e.g., CPU time) for optimizing the controlled variables in TECPMs, which is because the accurate models may raise the model complexity. However, the model with a longer optimization time is hard to apply to the control system with a high resolution (i.e., a small optimized time step) [1]. Thus, this Part 2 is mainly to study how to trade off prediction accuracies and optimization performances (including accuracy and time of the optimization). Firstly, the optimization performances for optimizing the different TECPMs by using various optimization algorithms were investigated and then the optimal match of TMCPMs and optimization algorithms was achieved. Secondly, the optimal match was applied to the MLB-MPC with ideal inputs of disturbances, and the energy-saving effect of the ACS and the optimal series of controlled variables were analyzed. 3.2.1 The optimization time of the optimization algorithms to the total energy consumption prediction models The optimized variables of the TECPMs are the chilled water supply temperature and cooling water supply temperature, which are the critical controlled variables in the ACS from the above analysis. Three optimization algorithms (i.e., GA, PSO, and SA) were respectively adopted to optimize the four TECPMs (i.e., MLR, ANN, SVR, and RF), and their optimization time of the CPU is shown in Table 5 . From Table 5, it can be seen that the PSO has the shortest optimization time (The average is 987.90 ms/per) due to its lightweight algorithm structure compared with GA and SA. It can be also observed that the MLR has a minimum optimization time of 93.70 ms/per on average, which is because the MLR has the simplest model structure compared to the ANN, SVR, and RF models. The ANN and the RF have a larger optimization time (7814.98 ms/per and 11134.23 ms/per on average, respectively) for the reason of their high model complexity. The SVR has not only a strong nonlinear fitting ability (i.e., obtained an optimal prediction accuracy, MAPE = 2.51%) but also a shorter optimization time (224 ms/per on average) when compared with the other models. In summary, in terms of the trade-off between prediction accuracies and optimization times, the SVR and the PSO were preliminarily chosen as the optimal match of the TECPMs and the optimization algorithms. Section 3.2.2 would further discuss the optimization accuracies combined with the energy-saving effect and then the final result of the optimal match would be given. 3.2.2 Energy-saving analysis of the machine learning-based model predictive control with ideal inputs of disturbances To investigate the ideal energy-saving effect of the MLB-MPC, the disturbing variables (i.e., outdoor wet-bulb temperature and cooling load) of the TECPM were set as the measured values, and then the ideal results would be compared with the actual results, which came from the MLB-MPC with predictive inputs of disturbances in Part 3. Figs. 16-18 display the energy-saving effects of the MLB-MPC using GA, PSO, and SA as the optimizer, respectively, compared to the measured results of the conventional control. It can be seen that the energy efficiency of the system was greatly improved after adopting the MLB-MPC strategy, and the energy-saving ratios of using GA, PSO, and SA were almost equal to about 7.5%. On the one hand, it is demonstrated that the SVR has a simple model structure so that its optimized effects of using these various algorithms are nearly equal value; On the other hand, these different optimization algorithms almost had the same optimization accuracies for the SVR model. Thereby, using the PSO with a shorter optimization time is the best way to optimize the SVR model. Moreover, from the above discussion (Section 3.1.3), we can easily see that due to the best prediction accuracy obtained by the SVR, thus the optimal match of TECPMs and optimization algorithms was the SVR and the PSO. This result would greatly improve the performance of the MLB-MPC framework. The optimal series with a 10-minute interval of the cooling water supply temperature and the chilled water supply temperature is displayed in Fig. 19 and Fig. 20 . As can be seen, the optimized cooling water supply temperatures were all higher than the corresponding outdoor wet-bulb temperatures and most lower than the corresponding measured values. This indicates that the optimal cooling water supply temperatures of the cooling towers are more inclined to the smaller values. The result is in line with the experience-based method of actual engineering, which generally regulates the degree of approximation of cooling towers to the smaller value. However, the experience-based method can not give the quantitative optimized result with precision, only can give the qualitative tendencies of the controlled variables, which largely restrains the improvement in the energy efficiency of the ACS. As can be seen from Fig. 20, the optimized regularity of the chilled water supply temperatures (Tchws ) after being optimized was difficult to determine and its optimal series heavily relied on the trade-off among the main energy-consumption components (e.g., chillers, cooling towers, pumps, fans, etc). Compared with the optimized results, the traditional setting methods commonly set the Tchws as a higher value, which can improve the efficiency of chillers but raise the energy consumption of user-side fans. Thus, when the proportion of energy consumption of user-side fans is higher, the increase or decrease of total energy consumption of the whole system is unknown by using this conventional setting method. To sum up, the quantitative optimization methods based on the MLB-MPC can give more accurate optimized results, compared to the qualitative methods based on the rules or experience. 3.3 Part 3: Machine learning-based model predictive control with predictive inputs of disturbances In actual applications of MLB-MPCs, the disturbances (e.g., outdoor wet-bulb temperature and cooling load) in TECPMs need to be predicted one step ahead. To better serve the engineering applications, this Part 3 would give the prediction methods of disturbances and further investigate the impact of disturbances on the optimization effect. 3.3.1 One-step-ahead prediction of cooling load and outdoor wet-bulb temperature From the above discussion, we can know that the SVR model has the best prediction performance due to its property of structural risk minimization. To decrease the complexity, the SVR model was used as the prediction model of outdoor wet-bulb temperature and cooling load. The inputs and outputs of the SVR models for forecasting the outdoor wet-bulb temperature and the cooling load are shown in Table 6 . In the prediction of cooling load (CL) [27], besides the first two historical cooling loads, the time stamp (TS), the outdoor dry-bulb temperature (Tdry ), and the outdoor relative humidity (RH) are also taken as input variables of the model. Similarly, in the prediction of outdoor wet-bulb temperature (Twet ), the TS is chosen as the input variable of the model as well as the first two historical values (Twet,t-1 and Twet,t-2 ). The TS was introduced into the model variables as a result of that the TS coded as 1\u201324 h can well display the change rule of weather or indoor heat gains during one day. The prediction performances of the SVR models after being optimized by the grid search and cross-validation method are displayed in Table 7 . It can be observed that the prediction accuracies of the SVR models to the Twet and the CL were high enough (e.g., their MAPEs were as low as 0.53% and 1.48%, respectively), thus they can satisfy the actual engineering application. As can be shown in Fig. 21 , the fitting effect of the SVR to measured outdoor wet-bulb temperatures (Twet ) is better, such as the MAPE and the RMSE were as low as 0.53% and 0.19 ℃, respectively, which accuracies are enough for the engineering application. It can be observed from Fig. 22 that the fitting effect on measured cooling loads by using the SVR model is satisfactory, such as its MAPE and RMSE were as low as 1.17% and 25.38 kW, respectively, which results are sufficient for the engineering application. 3.3.2 Energy efficiency analysis of the machine learning-based model predictive control with predictive inputs of disturbances As can be seen from Fig. 23 , the MLB-MPC with predictive inputs of disturbances (i.e., outdoor wet-bulb temperature and cooling load) achieved great energy efficiency, such as the energy-saving ratio of the total energy consumption reached up to 7.1%. Compared to the MLB-MPC with ideal inputs (i.e., no prediction errors) of disturbances in Part 2, the energy-saving ratio of the MLB-MPC with predictive inputs was only 0.4% less. The minor distinction (0.4%) is caused by the prediction errors of the models to the cooling loads and the outdoor wet-bulb temperatures. This result also demonstrates that the more accuracy in the prediction of the disturbances of the TECPM, the higher energy-saving ratio would be obtained. 4 Discussion The system-level modeling method of the TECPM achieved higher prediction accuracy, which was maybe because the change of the cooling load of the subway case was relatively small, thus the operation modes of the ACS were nearly unchanged, e.g., the operation number of chillers has not changed. As a result, the system-level modeling can obtain higher accuracy in the case of fewer training samples. However, in the situation of the cooling load with a large change such as commercial buildings, the system-level modeling method may require more training samples so that the operation modes of the system can be accurately identified (e.g., the combination modes of chillers, cooling towers, pumps, fans, etc.). Therefore, in the case of inadequate training data (i.e., poor information), the conventional component-level modeling method is more complex but higher accurate [9,28]. In future work, the applicability of the system-level modeling in various scenes with a large change in the cooling load would be further investigated. The feasible solution regions of the controlled variables (i.e., chilled water supply temperature and cooling water supply temperature) in this paper were determined by the statistic feature of training samples and the basic physical constraints so that the optimization boundaries were conservative and safe. But this would limit the exploration of other feasible solutions in the optimization process, as a result, the real optimal solution may be out of the conservative boundaries so that the global optimal solution was not accurately obtained. In future work, the combination of improving the generalization ability of models and the determination of dynamic feasible regions with wider boundaries would be further investigated. The control response of components (e.g., chillers, cooling towers, pumps, etc) to the setpoints was assumed as the ideal process in this paper, i.e., the response delay of components to the setpoints from the supervisory-level MLB-MPC was omitted. Although this assumption would benefit the simplification of the complex problem, the study on the robustness of local controls was also important to the optimization control of ACSs. In future work, an MLB-MPC considering the response delay would be further investigated, e.g., the MLB-MPC of this paper would be integrated into the simulation software of the Dymola [56,57]. Except for optimizing the operating parameters of ACSs, the optimizing of indoor air setting parameters (e.g., indoor\u2019s dry-bulb temperature and relative humidity) is also significant. For example, demand response based on the time-of-use electricity price can relieve the pressure of the power grid as well as reduce the electricity bill of ACSs [58]. In addition, the determination of fresh air supply is closely related to occupancy, which greatly impacts the energy consumption of ACSs. Therefore, the research on occupancy detection [59] is very important to the formulation of ACSs\u2019 optimization strategies. These aspects would be further investigated in the future. 5 Conclusion Compared to the conventional qualitative optimization methods (e.g., experience-based, rulers-based, etc.), the quantitative method of the machine learning-based model predictive control (MLB-MPC) proposed by this paper can give an optimal solution over every time step from the perspective of minimizing total energy consumption of the air-conditioning system (ACS). Through the sensitivity analysis, the controlled variables (i.e., chilled water supply temperature and cooling water supply temperature) in the total energy consumption prediction model (TECPM) were first determined, and then the disturbances (i.e., outdoor wet-bulb temperature and cooling load) in the TECPM were predicted with one step ahead. Lastly, the rolling optimization method was used to search the optimal controlled variables with maximum system efficiency for each controlled time step. To further improve the performance of the MLB-MPC, the optimal match of prediction models (for the TECPM) and optimization algorithms was obtained by the trade-off among prediction accuracies, optimization accuracies, and optimization times. Through the case studies, the optimal match was the support vector regression (SVR) model and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, e.g., the prediction accuracy of the SVR optimized by the grid search and cross-validation to the total energy consumption was 2.5% (mean absolute percentage error, MAPE) and the energy-saving ratio of the ACS after applying the MLB-MPC was about 7.1%. Besides, the prediction accuracies (MAPE) of the MLB-MPC to the outdoor wet-bulb temperature and the cooling load were 0.53% and 1.5%, respectively. These higher prediction accuracies can efficiently ensure the optimization performances of the proposed MLB-MPC framework. Moreover, the impact of disturbances on the energy-saving effect was also investigated, and the result revealed that the higher prediction accuracies obtained, the better performance of the MLB-MPC would be achieved. This novel MLB-MPC framework would provide new thought to the optimization control of ACSs.

Appendix A.1 Particle swarm optimization The PSO [1,60], as a popular swarm intelligence algorithm, derives from the predation behavior of birds, which can obtain the global optimal solution by sharing the information among multiple individuals. Compared with the genetic algorithm, the PSO is more simple due to omitting the process of crossover and mutation. Eqs. (A1) and (A2) are the formulas for updating the flight velocity vij and the position xij of the individual, respectively. Where the c1 and the c2 are learning factors for balancing the search capacities of the local optimal value and the global optimal value. The r1 and the r2 are the random positive values less than 1, which are used to explore the unknown solution space. The pij and the pgj are the historical local optimal value of an individual and the historical global optimal value of all individuals, respectively. The t is the number of iterations. The algorithm workflow of the PSO is shown in Fig. 24 . (A1) v ij t + 1 = v ij t + c 1 r 1 t p ij t - x ij t + c 2 r 2 t p gj t - x ij t (A2) x ij t + 1 = x ij t + v ij t + 1 A.2 Simulated annealing The SA shown in Fig. 25 , which simulates the physical annealing process of metal with high temperature, can achieve the global optimal solution by introducing the random factor as compared with hill-climbing algorithms [22,60]. Firstly, the metal\u2019s initial temperature T with a higher value is set to simulate the initial annealing state, and the random solution vector x is generated to calculate the initial internal energy E(x) (i.e., fitness function); Secondly, the new E(x\u2019) around the old point x is calculated to produce a new solution; Thirdly, if the new E(x\u2019) is less than the old E(x), then the new E(x\u2019) is accepted, otherwise, the new E(x\u2019) is accepted with probability P based on the Metropolis criteria; Lastly, the metal\u2019s temperature T is reduced by a certain percentage λ (i.e., annealing process). The above process is repeated iteratively and stopped when a certain condition is satisfied, e.g., the maximum iteration number is reached or the change of the solution is smaller than the certain threshold [34].

        "dc:description": "The dynamic optimization of key setpoints (e.g., supply water temperatures of chillers and cooling towers, or indoor temperature and humidity) can track the efficient performance point of the air-conditioning system (ACS), thus obtaining a great energy-saving effect. The model predictive control is an effective way to precisely adjust these setpoints. However, most of the existing studies focused on simple linear strategies, e.g., experience-based, rule-based, or component-based, which results in unsatisfactory energy efficiency. Aiming at this, the paper proposed a novel machine learning-based model predictive control (MLB-MPC) framework with predictive inputs of disturbances. The framework first employed the grid search and cross-validation to optimize the total energy consumption prediction models (TECPMs), which were built by data-driven models (e.g., multiple linear regression, artificial neural network, support vector regression (SVR), and random forest). And then the optimization performances of each TECPM to the controlled variables were obtained by using different optimization algorithms (e.g., genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization (PSO), and simulated annealing). Finally, the optimal match of TECPMs and optimization algorithms was achieved by trade-off among prediction accuracies, optimization accuracies, and optimization time. The case studies demonstrated that the optimal match for the MLB-MPC is SVR and PSO as they had the highest prediction accuracy (mean absolute percentage error of 2.5%) and shortest optimization time (41 ms/per) and optimization accuracies with little difference. After adopting the optimal match, the MLB-MPC with predictive disturbing inputs achieved a great energy-saving ratio of 7.1% for the ACS, which was only less than the MLB-MPC with ideal disturbing inputs by 0.4%. This indicated that exact predictions of disturbances (e.g., cooling load and outdoor wet-bulb temperature) are important for the MLB-MPC. The proposed MLB-MPC framework would provide a method for improving the energy efficiency of ACSs.",
