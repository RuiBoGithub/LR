Fig. 1 Fig. 2 Algorithm for circuit learning and training the VQC-based controller for demand response. Fig. 2 Fig. 3 The net electricity consumption by a single building participating in demand response with the VQC-based hybrid strategy as compared to its overall load demand over a period of one week in January is shown in (a). Cumulative electricity consumption by the building for heating with domestic hot water (DHW) to meet the heating requirements is plotted in (b). Monthly net electricity consumption realized by the VQC-based controller for the same building operating in different months along with the monthly photovoltaic (PV) generation, is shown in (c). Figures (d) and (e) describe the aggregate load demands, PV generation, and the individual electricity consumption for the four-building case over a period of one week. Fig. 3 Fig. 4 The net electricity consumption along with load demand requirements for a single building are presented in (a) over a period of one week. The varying carbon intensity levels over this period associated with power generation by the electric grid are also shown in (a). The amount of PV generation and the net CO2 emissions over this period are shown in (b). Fig. 4 Fig. 5 The number of parameters used by the policy and value function approximators in deep reinforcement learning-based controllers are shown in (a) for building microgrids of different sizes. Model predictive control (MPC) and the proposed hybrid VQC-based strategy for demand response require solving an optimization problem for computing controls.

Systems Engineering Cornell University Ithaca NY 14853 USA To counter the significant contribution of buildings to global energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, participation in demand response programs incentivizes grid-interactive buildings to curtail their load demand and promote energy efficiency with environmental sustainability. Quantum computing has the potential to impact problems at various scales, including demand response in buildings, by addressing the limitations of conventional demand response techniques implemented with classical computers. In this work, we propose a variational quantum circuit (VQC)-based hybrid control strategy for demand response that leverages the complementary strengths of quantum and classical computing paradigms. The hybrid VQC-based demand response technique exploits the expressive power of parameterized quantum circuits trained under a reinforcement learning setting, while a classical optimization solver computes controls for the demand response problem formulated as a sequential decision-making problem.

As over 70% of electricity in the U.S. is consumed by buildings, initiatives that leverage grid-interactive efficient buildings have been proposed to improve demand flexibility, energy efficiency, and reliability of the power grid [2,3]. Such initiatives aim to lower the reliance of residential and commercial buildings on the electric power grid by leveraging on-site renewable energy sources and energy storage devices, which directly translates to reduced carbon emissions, economic efficiency, and relieved stress on the grid. Grid-interactive buildings equipped with such resources present an opportunity to participate in demand response programs for net load reduction through sophisticated energy management strategies [4]. It is important to address the uncertainties associated with renewable energy sources to increase the adoption of buildings into demand response programs by preventing instability and ensuring resource availability. In addition to the renewable energy generation uncertainties, demand responsive energy management in buildings can be further complicated by the load shifting requirement as an adaptive response to grid signals [5,6]. Developing demand response strategies for grid-interactive buildings capable of addressing these issues is crucial to supporting sustainable energy development by achieving energy efficiency and grid stability [7]. Quantum computing has the potential to tackle problems associated with renewable and sustainable energy systems at various scales, owing to the advancements in the development of quantum hardware and algorithms [8]. Armed with a higher computational power than classical computers [9], quantum-enhanced optimization and quantum machine learning offer promising avenues to address the demand response problem in building microgrids [10]. Quantum-engineered power grids [11] can also be enabled by exploiting the inherent characteristics of power grid problems and mechanisms to develop tailored quantum computing-based solutions [12,13]. Applications of quantum computing for modernizing power grids have been previously explored and have unveiled potential benefits for enhancing security [14], reliability assessment [15], and optimizing power flow [16,17]. However, limitations of the current quantum computers termed as noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices in terms of their error rates and size [18,19] can induce complexities with the adoption of quantum computing techniques for real-world problems. Quantum algorithms for optimization and machine learning are typically tailored for specific problem classes to derive a computational advantage over their classical counterparts [20\u201324] and may lose their utility for problems relevant to energy systems [25]. To this end, it is imperative to consider the problem formulation and associated intricacies of the demand response problem along with the hardware limitations to realize the advantages offered by quantum computing techniques implemented on NISQ devices. Several demand response techniques implemented with classical computers for various formulations of the problem have been previously explored for energy management in buildings [26,27]. Optimal control approaches like model predictive control utilize a mixed-integer linear programming formulation of the demand response problem to optimize decisions associated with the equipped energy systems [28\u201330]. Although such approaches are capable of incorporating uncertainty information into the problem formulation [31], they may quickly grow intractable as the problem size increases. Conventional quantum optimization approaches leveraging reformulation into unconstrained optimization problems through approximations have been applied to building energy control [32] and power systems scheduling [25], but do not exhibit any computational advantage over classical approaches. Formulation of energy management by scheduling of energy systems as an optimization problem can also be tackled with hybrid quantum-classical optimization strategies [33]. These techniques derive their speedups over classical optimization approaches by exploiting the structure posed by the problem [34] and may not demonstrate similar advantages for demand response in buildings. Apart from the model-based approaches, various reinforcement learning approaches that do not rely on models derived from first principles have been investigated for the demand response problem [35\u201338]. In a reinforcement learning setting, demand-side energy management is formulated as a sequential decision-making problem to compute optimal decisions by observing the system states at any time. Function approximators like neural networks can be used in a deep reinforcement learning setting to parameterize policy and value functions to estimate the controls and expected cumulative returns, respectively, and can adapt to varying disturbances while demonstrating net load reduction capabilities [35,39]. Despite their flexibility, deep reinforcement learning-based demand response strategies suffer from sample inefficiency [40], which may yield suboptimal policies in a practical setting. Quantum reinforcement learning can address specific sequential decision-making problems by exploiting quantum parallelism to speed up learning [41], but may face scalability issues for large and continuous action spaces. Quantum enhancements for action selection in large action spaces have also shown improvements in terms of computational resource utilization [42]. On the other hand, the use of variational quantum circuits (VQCs) that facilitate parameterized quantum computations for policy and value function estimation has demonstrated versatility for various decision-making problems while reaping advantages from NISQ devices [43\u201346]. However, VQCs applied directly to estimate actions or value functions exhibit limitations that can affect their trainability in a reinforcement learning setting [47]. To overcome the shortcomings accompanied with standalone classical and quantum approaches [48], it is necessary to leverage hybrid quantum-classical strategies for demand response in grid-interactive buildings that can exploit the strengths of VQCs and classical optimization in a complimentary manner. There are several research challenges associated with developing a hybrid quantum computing-based control framework for demand response. The first challenge lies in constructing a quantum circuit architecture that balances the tradeoff between the expressivity and trainability of the VQC. As the performance of variational quantum algorithms is heavily influenced by the circuit architecture [49], it is essential to develop a robust quantum circuit to balance the effects of applying noisy quantum gates on NISQ devices. Another challenge lies in enabling a hybrid mode of operation between the quantum circuit execution and classical subroutines by integrating information from quantum operations to construct an optimization problem for control computation. The lack of provisions for strictly enforcing constraints on the applied controls in VQC-based reinforcement learning approaches [50] is an additional challenge, especially in energy management, and can be overcome by an optimization problem formulation that can be tractably solved with a classical solver. The final challenge lies in training the hybrid VQC-based controller that facilitates circuit learning while avoiding training pitfalls like sample inefficiency and adapting to time-varying uncertainties associated with the demand response problem. In this work, we propose a VQC-based controller for demand response in building microgrids that utilizes quantum circuit execution capabilities and a classical optimization problem solution approach in a complementary manner to exploit the strengths offered by both quantum and classical computing. Embedding the classical information comprising building states, renewable energy generation, and environmental disturbances onto the quantum device is conducted with amplitude encoding to enforce controller scalability. The VQC serves as a parametric function approximator for estimating the value function for a state and action pair, representing the discounted negative sum of net electricity consumption or carbon emissions. A robust VQC is constructed to transform the encoded quantum state representing the multidimensional classical information vector with parametric gate operations. An observable incorporating the controls is further used to compute the expectation value and translate the quantum information into classical information. Training the VQC for efficient value estimation without high resource utilization is performed in a reinforcement learning setting. Furthermore, an optimization problem formulated as a linear program to maximize the value estimate for a fixed building microgrid state serves as the classical component of the proposed hybrid quantum-classical strategy for demand response. Multiple computational experiments involving demand response in building microgrids of varying sizes are conducted to validate the performance efficiency of the proposed hybrid VQC-based demand response strategy, along with classical demand response techniques as baselines. We also consider different objectives, like net load reduction and net carbon emissions reduction, to evaluate the adaptive capabilities of the proposed hybrid controller towards varying sources of uncertainties. The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows, \u2022 A novel hybrid quantum-classical framework for optimal demand response in grid-interactive buildings enabled by gate-model quantum computing and classical optimization. \u2022 Controller design with a novel integration of VQC for estimating net electric consumption equipped with scalable quantum encodings and optimization problem solution with a classical solver for computing controls associated with energy storage devices. \u2022 Computational experiments to validate the net load reduction and net carbon emission reduction capabilities along with the scalability of the proposed hybrid VQC-based controller, as compared to classical baseline strategies. 2 Preliminaries Quantum computers operate on quantum bits, known as qubits, in contrast to classical computers manipulating bits to perform operations [9]. Unlike bits, each qubit exists in a two-dimensional vector or Hilbert space and can assume values beyond the discrete 0 and 1. An n-qubit system can then be represented by a 2 n dimensional Hilbert space. Unlike classical bits, a general qubit state ψ can be in a coherent superposition of its basis states, 0 and 1 . Qubits also exhibit quantum entanglement, which enables them to establish co-relations between their individually random behaviors. Measuring a quantum state results in a random collapse into one of its basis states and is an irreversible operation. A series of operations performed on a set of qubits or a quantum register within a quantum computer to accomplish a specific goal is referred to as a quantum algorithm. These operations are guided by different models of quantum computation like adiabatic quantum computing [51] and the circuit model [9]. In adiabatic quantum computing, computations are performed by evolving a quantum state from a known initial state to final state under adiabatic conditions [52]. On the other hand, circuit or gate-model quantum computers use quantum logical gates in a quantum circuit to manipulate qubit states in a sequential manner. In this work, we use methodologies associated with the circuit-based model of quantum computation owing to its universal nature of computation [53]. Quantum algorithms with the circuit model are typically presented as a sequence of quantum circuits that are executed in a sequential manner. These circuits involve various steps such as initial state preparation, applying unitary gate operations, and measurement operations to obtain interpretable classical information. Circuit-based quantum devices allow construction of parameterized models with variational quantum circuits (VQCs) [54]. VQCs have been extensively utilized in quantum machine learning algorithms due to their ability to retain advantages high expressive power [55] despite implementation on NISQ devices. There are three primary components to a VQC-based algorithm, namely, the encoder circuit, variational circuit or parametric gate operations, and circuit learning. Translating a classical datapoint x into a quantum state ψ x referred to as quantum encoding or embedding is facilitated by the encoder circuit. Data encoding is a crucial component of quantum machine learning techniques as it directly affects their computational performance [56]. Parametric gate operations represented by U θ are applied to the input quantum state ψ x with the variational circuit, where θ denoted the parameter vector. The circuit learning component involves measurement of the resulting quantum state with an observable M to estimate the target function f x . This allows for converting the quantum information produced by the variational circuit represented by the quantum state ψ θ into classical information to approximate the target function value as f x θ = ψ θ M ψ θ . Measurements with the Pauli operators σ x , σ y , σ z are commonly performed and can be expressed as shown in Eq. (1). Learning the function f x from data can be formulated as the minimization of a loss function L θ as the objective function. A gradient descent algorithm can then be employed to update the parameters θ associated with the variational circuit. (1) σ x = 0 1 1 0 σ y = 0 − i i 0 σ z = 1 0 0 − 1 3 Hybrid VQC-based control framework for demand response The proposed VQC-based controller for demand response in grid-interactive buildings formulated as a Markov decision process can be divided into three components: using a VQC for value function estimation, extracting controls from a trained VQC with a classical optimization problem, and integrating the quantum and classical subroutines to enable circuit learning and optimal control computation. We employ a VQC to approximate the state-action value for a state and control (x, u) pair. Within a reinforcement learning setting, the state-action value or the Q-value function represents the cumulative sum of discounted rewards over an infinite horizon. Fig. 1a provides an overview of the steps involved with estimating the value function for a state and action pair. 3.1 Markov decision process formulation The operation of a building microgrid comprising N grid-responsive buildings is modeled as a finite Markov decision process (MDP). To characterize the MDP with the state space S, action space A, transition dynamics, reward function, and the discount factor, we consider the discrete-time dynamics for each building within the microgrid. At any time t, a building consumes energy to satisfy the heating and cooling loads along with its non-shiftable appliance load. As grid-responsive buildings are equipped with energy storage devices to promote grid flexibility, an energy storage subsystem is considered to offset the building's load demand. This subsystem comprises battery energy storage as well as chilled water and domestic hot water tanks. Additionally, the building's electric demand can be supplemented by renewable energy generation facilitated with photovoltaic (PV) arrays. The hybrid VQC-based controller assigned to grid-responsive buildings operates without prior knowledge of energy model attributes or system transition dynamics. While historical data informs simulations during the training phase, we safeguard against data leakage to validate the generalization capabilities of the proposed controller. At each time step, the VQC-based agent observes the current environment state and produces actions to control all energy components within the building microgrid. These actions influence corresponding building operations, with reward signals received in response. The system then advances to the next state, with the agent learning by updating value functions and policies to maximize cumulative rewards. The transition dynamics of the underlying storage subsystems are modeled based on existing energy models [57] but are treated as unknown by the reinforcement learning agent. The collective effort by all buildings within the microgrid enforced by the centralized VQC-based agent promotes grid stability with an efficient demand response strategy, simultaneously considering various factors affecting the system dynamics. At any time t, the observable state x t encompasses each building's state as well as shared information like the weather data. The shared information comprises outdoor ambient air temperature, relative humidity, and solar radiation. Carbon intensity levels associated with electricity generation is also included within the shared information. The state x t also includes building-specific data like indoor temperature and relative humidity, along with its current cooling/heating and non-shiftable appliance loads. As PV generation directly affects the net electricity consumption levels within each building, the renewable generation level is also considered as a state variable. In addition, the current state-of-charge of energy storage devices specific to buildings in the microgrid, including the domestic hot water and chilled water storage along with the battery energy storage, also constitutes the observable state. The control actions associated with each storage device are scaled between [−1,1] based on the charging/discharging limits posed by the equipped device characteristics. The reward function r t dictates the objective for the reinforcement learning agent and can be set to -E net for net electricity consumption reduction. 3.2 Quantum encoding and ansatz design As the information pertaining to the building microgrid, including the observable state x t is classical, converting a classical data vector into a quantum state is the first step towards leveraging a VQC for function approximation. It is important to ensure the scalability of the VQC-based controller as the building microgrid size increases. So, an amplitude encoding scheme is used to encode the classical information into a n-qubit system. The logarithmic scaling offered by amplitude encoding allows for embedding multidimensional classical information onto the quantum device with only a few qubits. This is exemplified by embedding the net electric consumption and the outdoor weather conditions for a building microgrid recorded over a year using a single qubit in Fig. 1b. The t-distributed stochastic neighbor embeddings (t-SNE) are visualized for the recorded data as well as the quantum amplitudes of encoded states to highlight the similarity between the original data and their quantum embeddings achieved with only one qubit. A normalized vector such that ∑ i x i 2 = 1 can be represented by the amplitudes of a quantum state ψ p as shown in Eq. (2). For a state vector with dim x < 2 n , the redundant quantum amplitudes can be set to zero as x i = 0 , ∀ i = dim x + 1 , \u2026 , 2 n . Amplitude encoding is restricted to normalized classical vectors, leading to data representation with one less degree of freedom [58]. To prevent such loss of information, we utilize an additional qubit to encode the norm of the state vector x 2 with a parametric quantum gate. The Rx gate acts on a single qubit to perform a rotation about the x-axis by a specific amount. As the amount of rotation θ x is bounded, establishing bounds for x 2 allows for mapping the state vector norm to θ x . The generated input state for a classical state x can then be described as shown in Eq. (3). It should be noted that the parameter θ x in the data encoding step is fixed for each classical state and action pair. (2) ψ p = ∑ i = 1 2 n x i i (3) ψ x = ψ p ⊗ Rx θ x 0 (4) Q vqc x u = Q o ⋅ ψ f M u ψ f Following the initial state preparation step, a VQC comprising of trainable parameters is used to process the input n + 1 qubit quantum state. As shown in Fig. 1, we first entangle the quantum states from each qubit by applying a set of controlled NOT gates to consecutive qubits. A controlled NOT operation entangles two initially separable systems which plays an important role in the efficiency of a variational quantum algorithm [59]. A parametric gate operation represented by G R is applied as a single qubit unitary operation as described in Eq. (5). The parameters α i , β i and γ i form the rotation angles for the three consequent gates dictating the unitary operation for the i'th qubit state following the entanglement block. The Rx, Ry, and Rz gates perform a single qubit rotation along the corresponding axis and are given by Eq. (6) where I and σ indicate an identity and Pauli operator, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1, pooling operators [60] between consecutive qubits are also applied in the constructed VQC. The pooling operator P ϕ i ρ i δ i comprises a sequence of operations between a source and sink qubit pair, namely a fixed inversion of the sink qubit along the z-axis, an inverted controlled NOT operation, rotation of the source and sink qubits along z-axis and y-axis by ϕ i and ρ i amounts, respectively. Lastly, a controlled NOT rotation followed by a rotation of the sink qubit state by parameter δ i along the y-axis are applied in the pooling operator. These operators applied to each qubit pair promote the entangling capability of the VQC. (5) G R α i β i γ i = Rz α i Ry β i Rz γ i (6) Rc λ = cos λ 2 I − i sin λ 2 σ c , ∀ c ∈ x y z Performing parameterized gate operations within the VQC with an initial quantum state ψ x yields the quantum state ψ f . An expectation value of an observable M u with the resulting quantum state ψ f is further computed to translate quantum information into classical information. A Hermitian observable M u = diag u 1 − u 1 \u2026 u m − u m where m = 2 n , is used to compute the expectation value of the observable represented by ψ f M u ψ f . Finally, the value of an input state-action pair denoted by Q vqc x u is estimated by scaling the expectation value by a trainable parameter Q o as shown in Eq. (4) . The estimated state-action value Q vqc x u for the input observable building microgrid state and the corresponding controls represents the discounted negative sum of net electricity consumption over an infinite horizon for the load reduction objective. 3.3 Optimization problem formulation Optimal controls for an observable building microgrid state x can be extracted from the policy π x that maximizes the expected discounted rewards. Here, we leverage a deterministic policy represented by u = π x to compute the controls that optimize the value function as π x ≡ arg max u Q vqc x u . The encoded n + 1 qubit quantum state ψ x embedding the classical information x can be written as ψ x = ∑ i = 1 2 n + 1 s i i where s i indicates the quantum amplitude for the i'th basis state. The constructed VQC with a fixed set of parameters θ ≡ α β γ ϕ ρ δ are unitary operations applied to the initial state ψ x . The quantum amplitudes for the resulting quantum state ψ f are then linear combinations of the initial amplitudes s ≡ s 1 s 2 \u2026 s n + 1 T . The linear combinations can be represented as shown in Eq. (7), where λ i θ T indicates the i'th row of the parametric unitary posed by the VQC while s i θ x is the i'th quantum amplitude for the obtained quantum state ψ f . (7) ψ f = ∑ i = 1 2 n + 1 λ i θ T s i = ∑ i = 1 2 n + 1 s i θ i (8) DR x θ max ∑ i = 1 2 n s 2 i − 1 θ x 2 − s 2 i θ x 2 u i s . t . A T u ≤ b As the scaled expectation computed over the observable M u yields the value of a state-action pair, the policy π x which maximizes the value function can be formulated as a math programming problem in Eq. (8). It should be noted that s i θ is a complex number with its magnitude represented by s i θ x . Given a trained VQC, the optimization problem DR x θ comprises maximizing the value estimate for an input building microgrid state over the control space encompassing the charging/discharging of energy storage devices in buildings subject to actuator constraints. For energy management in buildings, the bounds on charging and discharging levels u min u max can be established at each timestep as they are dependent on the current state of charge of the storage devices comprising the classical state x. Additionally, constraints A T u ≤ b can encompass measures to improve demand flexibility in grid-interactive buildings [4]. The optimization problem formulated at each timestep comprises m = 2 n variables and can be solved with a classical linear solver in a tractable manner. 3.4 Variational quantum circuit learning An overview of the training algorithm is shown in Fig. 2 . The constructed circuit is initialized with parameters θ ≡ α β γ ϕ ρ δ sampled from a uniform distribution denoted by U − π π . A replay buffer D is used to store transitions and serves as experience replay to help increase sample inefficiency and prevent training instabilities [61]. Each transition at timestep t comprises of observed state x t , applied controls u t , the obtained reward r t , and the following state x t + 1 . To balance the exploration and exploitation while training the hybrid VQC-based controller, an epsilon-greedy strategy is used wherein the probability of choosing controls that maximize the value estimate is 1 − ε as shown in Eq. (9). Instead of randomly sampling controls during the exploration phase, a rule-based controller (RBC) can be used to ensure reasonable charging and discharging levels of energy storage devices in grid-interactive buildings. It should also be noted that the probability ε is decayed by a factor of ε decay with each timestep. (9) Pr u t = arg max u DR x t θ = 1 − ε (10) y t = r t + γ ⋅ max DR x t + 1 θ (11) δ Q vqc δθ = 2 Q o ⋅ P vqc θ + π 2 − P vqc θ − π 2 (12) P vqc θ = ψ f θ M u ψ f θ During the learning phase, a batch of transitions of size B size is randomly sampled from the experience replay buffer. In Q-learning, the value function estimator is trained to approximate the Bellman's equation. The targets for all state and action pairs are computed by maximizing the value function over the set of next states as shown in Eq. (10). Here, γ represents the discount factor. Computing the target values requires solving an optimization problem DR x t + 1 θ with a classical solver for each x t + 1 in the sampled batch of transitions. Although this can be performed separately for each transition, the computation overhead on the classical end can be further reduced by formulating a joint optimization problem over the entire batch. The joint maximization problem comprises m ⋅ B size variables for which the solution obtained with a classical solver maximizes value estimate for each transition owing to the disjoint nature of state dependent actuator constraints. With the computed targets, the VQC-based value function estimator can be updated in a supervisory manner to minimize the mean squared error objective L θ = E x u r x ' Q vqc x u − y 2 . Gradients of the objective with respect to individual parameters θ ∈ θ forming the VQC are required to perform a gradient descent step. Here, we use a parameter shift rule to estimate the gradients of the VQC-based value function approximator Q vqc given by Eqs. (11) and (12). P vqc θ in Eq. (12) represents the classical information obtained for an individual data point following preparation of the quantum state with the constructed VQC and the measurement operation. Gradients of the objective function with respect to each VQC parameter are estimated with the above strategy. Lastly, the scaling factor Q o is updated with a gradient descent step. These steps are repeated over multiple training episodes for circuit learning in the hybrid VQC-based controller. 4 Computational results To evaluate the performance of the proposed hybrid VQC-based controller for demand response in building microgrids, we formulate the demand response problem in grid-interactive buildings as a finite MDP using CityLearn [57], which allows for controlling energy storage devices in each building to manage net electricity consumption and associated carbon emissions. With pre-simulated heating and cooling demands and non-shiftable load, CityLearn facilitates the construction of a grid-interactive environment wherein thermal and electric storage devices in buildings can be managed for efficient net load reduction. Here, we use historically recorded data for heating, cooling, and non-shiftable loads in Cornell University's Ithaca campus. Simulated operations of several microgrids with varying number of buildings are constructed to validate the performance efficiency and scalability of the proposed VQC-based demand response strategy. The applicability of the proposed strategy is further demonstrated by evaluation with a ten-building microgrid, which is the largest case study tackled with quantum computing-based techniques. Buildings in the microgrid are also equipped with a solar photovoltaic array, which supplements the building's load demand. The thermal energy storage and battery storage devices are sized such that they can satisfy the building's energy requirements. 4.1 Experimental setup We conduct two computational experiments with different objectives, namely, reducing the net electricity consumption of buildings in the microgrid and lowering the net carbon emissions associated with the electric power generation. The reward functions for both case studies are varied as r t = − E t and r t = − c t E t , where E t and c t indicate the net electricity consumption in buildings and the carbon intensity levels associated with electricity generation at time t. For the proposed hybrid VQC-based control strategy, quantum circuits executed on NISQ hardware are susceptible to noise and decoherence effects, which can lead to errors in the estimation of the value function for the observable microgrid state and control pair. During the training of the VQC in a reinforcement learning setting, errors in estimation can further lead to biased gradient updates for the parameters of the quantum circuit. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed VQC-based controller in the presence of noise associated with NISQ hardware, we conduct experiments with building microgrids of varying sizes using a noise model incorporating the quantum gate errors and readout errors. The IBM Brisbane quantum device equipped with the Eagle processor [62] comprising 127 qubits with a gate error rate of 1.9% was used as the noise model for the computational experiments associated with all building microgrids. Model-based approaches like model predictive control (MPC) and deep reinforcement learning approaches like deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) are also implemented as baselines against the proposed VQC-based hybrid demand response strategy. As VQC offers high expressivity with a smaller number of parameters, we also implement DDPG using neural networks with fewer parameters, termed here as Lo-DDPG. Lo-DDPG serves as a fair classical baseline against the hybrid VQC-based controller. The MPC strategy uses a state-space model for the building microgrid operation, which is extracted from a simulation performed over historical data by taking random actions, in addition to using a certainty equivalence strategy for optimization problem formulation. The certainty equivalent formulation assumes nominal values for uncertainty sources like PV generation, outdoor weather conditions, and carbon intensity levels. These nominal values are computed from historical data and used for conducting simulations with microgrids of varying sizes across different time periods. The DDPG algorithm employs a combination of deep neural networks to approximate both the actor and critic functions, allowing it to learn a policy for energy management that maximizes long-term rewards. Specifically, the actor-network outputs continuous control, while the critic network estimates the state-action value of the input state-action pair. The hyperparameters used for training the DDPG algorithms for load reduction and carbon emission reduction are consistent with those used for training the VQC-based controller. The number of parameters used by the DDPG policy and value function estimator network are provided in Fig. 5a. Lo-DDPG technique is a variant of the DDPG algorithm with the exception of the use of function approximators with fewer parameters, as shown in Fig. 5a. The hyperparameters used during the training of the parametric policy and value function estimator networks are the same as those of DDPG and the proposed VQC-based controller to ensure a fair comparison. 4.2 Energy management The VQC-based demand response strategy is evaluated over multiple time periods for case studies with varying number of buildings, their attributes, and objectives. Fig. 3a depicts the net electricity consumption by a single building achieved with the VQC-based controller as compared to its overall energy requirements or net load demand over a period of one week in the month of January. Along with its efficient net load reduction capabilities, the VQC-based hybrid technique also exhibits a significant reduction in energy required to operate domestic hot water (DHW) storage and heating devices to meet the building's heating energy requirements in winter. This can be seen from the corresponding cumulative values provided over a week in January in Fig. 3b. To validate the performance of the proposed controller subject to varying uncertainty sources like solar radiation, we compute the total PV generation and the net electricity consumption for the single building over months in different seasons, as represented by Fig. 3c. As seen in this figure, the VQC-based controller is capable of adjusting to uncertain renewable energy generation, resulting in reduced electricity consumption in response to increased PV generation in summer and vice-versa in colder months. We also visualize the electricity consumption for each building in the four-building case, along with the aggregate loads and PV generation over a week in January in Fig. 3d-e. As the VQC-based controller is trained to reduce net electricity consumption, the average consumption per building is also plotted in Fig. 3e. This serves as a basis for the identification of time periods during which an imbalance of increased load in some buildings along with decreased consumption in remaining buildings result in net overall load reduction capabilities. A decrease in electricity consumption in all buildings during periods of high PV generation is also observed in these figures. Additional comparisons conducted with larger case studies and varying demand response strategies are presented in Table 1 . For the load reduction objective, the performance of the MPC-based demand response technique is significantly lower than the proposed hybrid VQC-based controller. This can be attributed to the inability of the MPC controller to tackle various uncertainties associated with the building microgrid. On the other hand, DDPG, which uses feedforward neural networks with nonlinear activations to parameterize policy and value functions, exhibits better load reduction capabilities than the MPC controller. Specifically, a slight improvement in performance over the hybrid VQC-based demand responsive strategy is observed with DDPG for the one-building microgrid. It can be seen that as the temperature drops over the months of July and October, DDPG adapts better to such declines, resulting in improved load reduction performance for the smaller building microgrids but remains within 2% of the observed consumption levels with the VQC-based approach. As the hybrid VQC-based demand response strategy with fewer parameters performs competitively against the DDPG technique implemented on a classical computer, it is important to validate their performance against a fair classical counterpart. The Lo-DDPG uses affine policies combined with an activation function and comprises significantly fewer trainable parameters than DDPG. Despite this affine approximation, the number of policy parameters in Lo-DDPG scale linearly with the state space size in contrast to logarithmic scaling with the VQC-based strategy. Lo-DDPG based demand response technique performs poorly in terms of net load reduction over all problem sizes with few exceptions for the one-building microgrid. A tradeoff between the Lo-DDPG performance and the sample inefficiency with an increasing number of parameters can be observed by comparing the difference in net loads with that of the hybrid VQC-based approach. As the problem size increases, performance degradation observed with Lo-DDPG over hybrid VQC-based controller also increases accompanied by an increased computational effort required to train the parametric networks. 4.3 Carbon dioxide emission As varying levels of carbon intensity which represents the carbon dioxide (CO2) emission rate accompanied by power generation serves as an additional source of uncertainty to the building microgrid, we evaluate the VQC-based controller for reducing net CO2 emissions. The load demand for a single building over a week in January is shown in Fig. 4a, along with its observed net electricity consumption achieved with VQC-based energy management. It can be seen that despite the emissions reduction objective, there is a substantial decrease in net electricity consumption to satisfy the load requirements. The carbon intensity levels associated with power generation on the grid side are also presented in Fig. 4a. The net CO2 emissions over this period corresponding to the single building's electricity needs are presented in Fig. 4b, along with the building's PV generation levels. Despite minimal correlations between electricity consumption and carbon intensity levels, the emitted CO2 levels remain consistently low during periods of high renewable generation. The net carbon emissions recorded for building microgrids of varying sizes with different controllers are also provided in Table 1. Aligning with the load reduction objective, MPC exhibits poor carbon emission reduction capabilities as varying carbon intensity serves as an additional source of uncertainty in the MPC problem formulation. DDPG demonstrates competitive emissions reduction performance for the smaller microgrids. Deep reinforcement learning approaches like DDPG typically exhibit sample inefficiencies with an increase in problem size which are evident from the net emissions for seven and ten building microgrids. Problem size and qubit count metrics for the building microgrids of varying sizes tackled with the VQC-based hybrid strategy are reported in Table 2 . As evident from these metrics, both the seven and ten-building microgrid use only eight qubits. This means that a significant number of quantum amplitudes during the embedding stage of the input state for the seven-building microgrid are set as zero. We can see that the improvements obtained with the hybrid VQC-based controllers over the Lo-DDPG technique for both load reduction and carbon emissions reduction objectives vary as the building microgrid size increases. These trends also indicate a correlation between the number of nonzero quantum amplitudes during the embedding stage and the controller performance. The logarithmic scaling for qubit counts with that of the state dimensionality contributes to the sparsity of quantum states and, in turn, can affect the overall demand response performance. 4.4 Computational performance In addition to the efficient load reduction capabilities of the proposed hybrid VQC-based demand response strategy, it also exhibits scalability in terms of computational resource utilization. As amplitude encoding is used to encode classical state x as quantum amplitudes of the initial quantum state, the number of qubits n required scale logarithmically with the dimensionality of input state and can be represented by n = log 2 x + 1 . For the constructed VQC, a similar scaling follows with an O n number of circuit parameters. We have presented metrics associated with problem size and qubit count in Table 2 for the conducted computational experiments comprising building microgrids of varying sizes. The number of parameters used to approximate policy and value function networks in Lo-DDPG and DDPG are also compared with those utilized by the corresponding VQC-based controller are also presented in Fig. 5a. In contrast to the hybrid VQC-based controller, the number of parameters increase linearly with the size of the state for classical deep reinforcement learning algorithms like DDPG. Increasing dimensionality of the problem size typically results in training pitfalls associated with classical reinforcement learning techniques like sample inefficiency. On the other hand, the VQC-based hybrid strategy offers a parameter-efficient approach without affecting the demand responsive control performance. It should also be noted that demand response with energy management in the ten-building microgrid is also the largest energy systems problem tacked with a quantum computing-based strategy. The computational resources required to solve the optimization problems for control computation within the proposed hybrid strategy also remain low on the classical end. At any time, the size of the formulated optimization problem increases linearly with the dimensionality of the control space u or the number of buildings. For the MPC-based demand response strategy, the size of the optimization problem scales as O H x ⋅ u where H is the size of the receding horizon. Linear programming solvers can solve such optimization problems in polynomial time. We record the computational time required to compute controls at multiple timesteps for each computational experiment, which are provided in Table 2. These recorded computational times are also compared to the control computation times utilized by the MPC strategy in Fig. 5b. It is clear that the computation time for MPC-based techniques grows quickly as the size of building microgrids increases, owing to the increase in state dimensionality. As evident from these metrics, the proposed VQC-based hybrid technique for demand response not only provides a parameter-efficient value estimation strategy with a quantum circuit but also ensures computational efficiency offered by classical optimization solvers. Although the proposed hybrid VQC-based strategy for demand response in grid-interactive buildings exhibits performance and computational efficiency, certain factors may pose challenges to this approach as the building microgrid size increases. Due to the logarithmic scaling for the number of qubits obtained with the data encoding scheme utilized here, the number of parameters in the VQC leveraged for value function estimation can remain constant for problems of varying sizes. This can be observed in Table 2, where eight qubits are required for problems of varying dimensionality and inconsistencies in performance improvement against classical demand response techniques, as seen in Table 1. An additional bottleneck that can be encountered with the adoption of the proposed approach is the connectivity of quantum hardware. Constructing the quantum ansatz used for the proposed VQC-based controller may require high-depth circuits, which can lead to qubit decoherence owing to error-prone quantum hardware [63]. On the classical end, the computational time required by the classical solver for control computation is trivial, as reported in Table 2, and can exhibit polynomial scaling with the number of control variables for linear optimization problems. Despite this, as the control computation with a classical solver relies on the quality of value estimation with the VQC, it is crucial to consider factors like quantum hardware connectivity and gate fidelities for scaling up the proposed approach for large-scale building microgrids. 5 Conclusion In this work, we presented a hybrid VQC-based control framework for demand response in grid-responsive buildings. The proposed controller leveraged a hybrid quantum-classical strategy by integrating quantum circuit operations with classical optimization to enhance the control performance. A robust VQC was constructed by balancing its expressivity and trainability properties for value function estimation. Quantum unitary operations executed in the parametric circuit were exploited to construct an optimization problem for value function maximization over the control space. Solving the maximization problem with a classical solver yielded controls at each timestep. A Q-learning reinforcement learning strategy was employed to perform circuit learning and value function estimation. The applicability and performance efficiency of the proposed hybrid VQC-based controller were evaluated through several computational experiments with building microgrids of varying sizes. The scalability of the proposed strategy was demonstrated with a microgrid comprising ten buildings. Compared to the baseline demand response techniques implemented on a classical computer, the proposed VQC-based demand response approach demonstrated adaptivity and scalability in terms of computational resource utilization as well as efficient net load reduction and carbon emissions reduction capabilities. The hybrid VQC-based controller maintains logarithmic scaling with respect to the dimensionality of the state space of the underlying Markov decision process. Although the presented computational results demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the proposed hybrid VQC-based technique for demand response in building microgrids under the NISQ setting, this control framework is extensible and can be adapted for control problems that can be cast as a sequential decision-making problem. Owing to the amplitude encoding in VQC for value function estimation, computing controls for HVAC systems in buildings [32] and wind turbines [64] requires O logN qubits with N representing the number of buildings and wind turbines, respectively. This work can also be extended across directions, such as exploring alternative quantum ansatz like the hardware-efficient ansatz or tailored ansatz inspired by the specific decision-making problem. Furthermore, applying advanced quantum circuit optimization techniques to reduce the number of quantum gates for the VQC to improve scalability and performance can also be investigated. Lastly, mitigating the impact of decoherence and noise on the VQC-based controller and enhancing the accuracy of value function estimation with robust training approaches is another promising research direction.

        "dc:description": "To counter the significant contribution of buildings to global energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, participation in demand response programs incentivizes grid-interactive buildings to curtail their load demand and promote energy efficiency with environmental sustainability. Quantum computing has the potential to impact problems at various scales, including demand response in buildings, by addressing the limitations of conventional demand response techniques implemented with classical computers. In this work, we propose a variational quantum circuit (VQC)-based hybrid control strategy for demand response that leverages the complementary strengths of quantum and classical computing paradigms. The hybrid VQC-based demand response technique exploits the expressive power of parameterized quantum circuits trained under a reinforcement learning setting, while a classical optimization solver computes controls for the demand response problem formulated as a sequential decision-making problem. The applicability and efficiency of the proposed hybrid quantum-classical control strategy are demonstrated by performing computational experiments involving energy management in grid-interactive buildings equipped with various energy storage devices. The hybrid VQC-based strategy exhibits improvement in load reduction and carbon emissions reduction of over 13.6% compared to classical baselines like deep deterministic policy gradient and model predictive control while ensuring scalability as the size of the building microgrids increases.",
