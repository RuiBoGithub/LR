Bayesian network is a powerful algorithm to diagnose the faults in building energy systems based on incomplete and uncertain diagnostic information. In practice, it is very challenging to construct Bayesian networks for large-scale and complex systems. Inspired by the object oriented programming technology, a hierarchical object oriented Bayesian network-based method is proposed in this study. Its basic idea is to reuse the standard Bayesian network fragments predefined in the classes to generate the system-level fault diagnosis models for target systems. Inheritance is adopted to avoid inconsistent modeling of similar classes. It allows sub-classes to inherit the Bayesian network fragments from their super-classes. For a specific building energy system, the fragments are reused and combined to generate a hierarchical object oriented Bayesian network for real-time fault diagnosis. The proposed method is evaluated using the experimental data from an industrial building. The results show that the proposed method can provide customized fault diagnosis solutions for complex building energy systems without tedious and repeated modeling works. Most of the typical faults are successfully isolated. Keywords Hierarchical object oriented Bayesian network Fault diagnosis Building energy systems Building energy conversation 1 Introduction Buildings are responsible for 32% of the global energy consumption and 33% of the greenhouse gas emissions [1]. Many technologies have been developed to improve the energy efficiency over the whole building lifecycle [2,3]. Among these technologies, effective fault diagnosis (FD) tools are the most essential. It is estimated that removing faults timely can save 10\u201340% of the building energy consumption [4]. Generally, the existing FD methods for building energy systems can be classified into knowledge-driven sub-category and data-driven sub-category [5]. The knowledge-driven methods can be further classified into model-based and rule-based. The model-based methods introduce physical or statistical models to predict the benchmarking, and utilize the residuals between the monitored values and benchmarking to detect the faults [6\u20138]. The rule-based methods rely on domain experts to define rules and thresholds to detect and diagnose the faults [9,10]. The knowledge-driven solutions are based on comprehensive understanding of the system operations and fault action mechanisms. They usually have good interpretability and reliability. However, building energy systems have the characteristics of large thermal inertia, nonlinearities and uncertainties. Developing such methods for building energy systems is very time-consuming. In recent years, data-driven FD methods show advantages in this field [11]. Artificial intelligence techniques are adopted to detect and diagnose the faults in building energy systems, including support vector machine [12\u201314], principal component analysis [15\u201317], support vector data description [18\u201320], artificial neural networks [21\u201323], data mining [24,25], deep learning [26\u201328], transfer learning [29,30], etc. Such methods have high accuracy, flexibility and adaptability. However, the data-driven solutions are likely to fail if the training data, especially the faulty data, are insufficient. In addition, most of the data-driven methods are black boxes. They cannot provide detailed information about the decision process. Therefore, their reliabilities are doubtful. In the last decade, Bayesian network (BN) becomes one of the state-of-art algorithms for building energy systems FD. The structures and parameters of BNs have clear physical meanings, which can be determined based on expert knowledge, operational data or a combination of both. The corresponding author proposed a general BN-based framework for FD of chillers [31]. They manually defined directed acyclic graphs to explicitly represent the relations between faults and symptoms, and estimated probabilistic parameters to quantify the uncertain strengths of the relations. Such methods are applied to diagnose the faults of variable air volume terminals [32], air handling units (AHUs) [33,34], gear pumps [35], ground-source heat pumps [36], and HVAC systems [37,38] in buildings. The results indicate that the BN-based FD methods are very effective to overcome the challenges of incomplete or uncertain diagnostic information, which are very common in practice. The BNs for FD can also be learned automatically if the training data are sufficient. For example, He et al. utilized the historical data to train BN-based multi-class classifiers for FD of chillers [39]. Liu et al. applied the maximum likelihood estimation to learn the BN parameters for FD of heat pumps [40]. Wang et al. integrated a distance rejection algorithm for feature selection of BN-based chiller FD [41]. They further combined the expectation\u2013maximization algorithm to overcome the problem of missing data for chiller FD [42]. The author introduced a hybrid strategy to determine BNs for AHUs FD based on both expert knowledge and operational data [43]. It has good interpretation and high accuracy. In summary, BNs can combine the advantages of the knowledge-driven methods and data-driven methods. However, most of the existing BN-based FD methods are developed for specific equipment. Building energy systems are complex in most cases. They contains hundreds or even thousands of equipment. A local fault would lead to cascade reactions of the interconnected equipment, resulting in risks or even breakdowns of the whole system. Moreover, building energy systems usually adopt various operation strategies for different working conditions. The symptoms are different accordingly. It is challenging to scale up system-level BNs as the complexity of FD problem increases. The object oriented approach could be a proper solution to such issue. An Object Oriented Bayesian Network (OOBN) consists of repetitions of modular BN fragments. OOBN-based methods deal with complex problems by dividing them into several simple sub-problems. Cai et al. proposed an OOBN-based method for FD of subsea production systems [44]. They defined repetitive and non-repetitive BN fragments for different components in subsea production systems, and obtained a system-level OOBN for the specific system by reusing and combining these fragments. Sarwar et al. developed an OOBN-based method for resilience assessment of offshore power systems [45]. They built BN fragments to model the resilience factors for different sub-systems, and integrated these fragments to calculate the combined resilience factors for the whole system. The similar methods are also applied for risk management [46], reliability evaluation [47,48], and health monitoring [49] of complex systems. The research results indicate that OOBNs not only have the same advantages of BNs, but also have the ability to solve complex problems without repeated modeling. However, the existing OOBN-based methods build individual BN fragments for all types of elements in complex systems. They do not take their similarities into account. For the building energy systems with dozens if not hundreds of types of equipment, the number of BN fragments would be large, increasing the chance of errors and inconsistencies in modeling. Besides, there still lacks a general OOBN-based FD methods for building energy systems. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a hierarchical object oriented Bayesian network (HOOBN)-based method for diagnosing the faults in building energy systems. A general framework is proposed to construct standard Bayesian FD classes for building energy systems. Each class contains a BN fragment for diagnosing the local faults. A Bayesian FD class hierarchy is developed with the implementation of inheritance. It allows the similar but not identical classes to derive the attributes of existing classes. The modeling inconsistency can be avoided. For a target building energy system, the BN fragments of the Bayesian FD classes are reused and combined to generate a customized HOOBN. The HOOBN conducts backward inference for diagnosing the faults in real-time. 2 Object oriented Bayesian network A BN is denoted as BN = { N , E , P } , where N = { n 1 , ⋯ , n a } is the set of nodes representing random variables. E = {( n b , n c ), ⋯ , ( n x , n y )} is the set of direct edges representing the dependencies between nodes. The first element of a 2-tuple in E represents the parent node, and the second element represents the child node. P is the quantitative part of the BN, containing the prior probability distributions for root nodes and the conditional probability tables (CPTs) for other nodes. A CPT describes the conditional distribution of a child node given the joint assignments of its parent nodes, denoted as P ( n i π i ) . Where, π i is the parent node set of a node n i . OOBN introduces the concepts of class and object to make it easier to construct the identical or similar sub-networks for a complex BN. Class is the basic element of OOBN, which contains a standard and reusable BN fragment. Inheritance is implemented to make the existing classes extensible. There are four types of inheritances as demonstrated in Fig. 1 (a)-(d). Single inheritance is the simplest type of inheritance. It allows a sub-class to inherit the BN fragment from a super-class. Multi-level inheritance refers to the behavior of the classes inheriting for more than twice. Hierarchical inheritance means that two or more classes inherit from a common super-class. Multiple inheritances allow a class to inherit from more than one super-class Object is the other basic element of OOBN. An object is instantiated based on a class. The BN fragment in the object is identical with that in the corresponding class. An object communicates with the outside world via the edges pointing from the object and ending at the external nodes. Fig. 2 illustrates an example of an OOBN. The object-1 is instantiated based on the Class X. The object-2 and object-3 are instantiated based on the Class Y. External nodes are defined to represent the additional random variables. Direct edges are built to describe the relationships among the objects and external nodes. 3 Fault diagnosis framework based on hierarchical object oriented Bayesian networks 3.1 Overview of the proposed method The flow chart of the proposed HOOBN-based FD method is shown in Fig. 3 . It consists of two steps, i.e., development of the Bayesian FD class hierarchy, and generation of the HOOBN. In the first step, a Bayesian FD class hierarchy is developed using a top-down approach, starting with the general FD knowledge to develop the super-classes and extracting the specialized FD knowledge to define the sub-classes. Each class uses a BN fragment to describe the FD knowledge. There are three abstraction levels of classes in the hierarchy, i.e. base, derived, and specialized. The base FD classes describe the most general knowledge that are applicable to the equipment of different types. They are based on the physical principles of fault occurrences and action mechanisms. The derived FD classes describe the general knowledge that are applicable to the equipment of the similar types. They inherit the BN fragments from the base FD classes and make extensions to capture the fault impacts on the equipment operations. The specialized FD class is designed for the specific functional units. It describe the specialized FD knowledge that are only applicable to the functional units of the same type. A specialized FD class inherits from more than one super-level FD class. In the second step, a HOOBN is generated for diagnosing the faults in a target building energy system. Objects are instantiated for all functional units in the target system. System symptom nodes are defined for monitoring the system operations. The propagation behaviors of the local faults are described by adding the edges pointing from the unit FD object to the system symptom nodes. In the on-line process, the operational data are sampled to determine the symptom node states in the HOOBN. Backward inference is conduced to diagnose the faults in real-time. 3.2 Development of the Bayesian fault diagnosis class hierarchy In the Bayesian FD class hierarchy, each class contains a BN fragment as presented in Fig. 4 . There are three types of nodes representing the faults, hidden symptoms and observed symptoms in building energy systems respectively. The fault nodes are usually set as the root nodes of a BN fragment. The hidden symptom nodes physically describe the fault action behaviors. They are intermediate nodes of a BN fragment, which cannot be observed directly. The observed symptom nodes are conceptual representations of the performance indices that are sensitive to faults. They can be measured or calculated directly. 3.2.1 Base fault diagnosis classes The basic elements in building energy systems can be categorized into several groups according to their properties. With the assumption that the elements of the same group have similar fault action mechanisms, a base FD class is developed for each element group to describe the most general FD knowledge. In this paper, we categorize all basic elements in building energy systems into four groups, i.e., electric equipment, non-electric equipment, actuator and sensor. Four base FD classes are developed for them. Fig. 5 presents an example of the BN in the actuator FD class. It consists of a fault node, a hidden symptom node, and an observed node. A prior probabilistic distribution and two CPTs are estimated for the nodes. 3.2.2 Derived fault diagnosis classes A derived FD class inherits the BN fragment from a base FD class or a super-level derived FD class as the default attributes. Beyond that, the derived FD class has more nodes for representing the specific faults and symptoms. Direct edges associate the inherited BN fragment with the additional nodes, starting from the former and ending at the latter. CPTs are defined for the child nodes. The pseudocode for determining a derived FD class is addressed as Algorithm 1 in Appendix B. Generally, actuators can be categorized into switching actuators and regulation actuators. Therefore, two derived FD classes are developed to describe the FD knowledge for diagnosing the stuck faults in the two types of actuators, as shown in Fig. 6 . Both of them contain the BN fragment inherited from the actuator FD class shown in Fig. 5. Additional observed symptom nodes are defined to represent the specific performance indices. CPTs are defined for the additional symptom nodes. 3.2.3 Specialized fault diagnosis classes A functional unit usually contains many equipment, actuators and sensors, which interrelate with each other during operations. Faults would propagate among them. For instance, a typical VAV terminal unit consists of an air damper, a flowrate senor and a temperature sensor. Faults propagate in the unit and result in combined negative influences. It is necessary to capture such propagation behaviors and isolate the true faults. Therefore, specialized FD classes are proposed. A specialized FD class inherits BN fragments from more than one super-level FD class, and make extensions to capture their interrelations. The pseudocode for determining a specialized FD class is addressed as Algorithm 2 in Appendix B. Fig. 7 shows an example of the BN in the VAV terminal unit FD class. It inherits the BN fragments from the regulation actuator FD class and sensor FD class. 3.3 Hierarchical object oriented Bayesian network-based fault diagnosis The Bayesian FD class hierarchy provides standard BN fragments for diagnosing the local faults in functional units of various types. For a target building energy system, a HOOBN is generated by reusing and combining the BN fragments from the Bayesian FD classes. It includes three steps. Firstly, an object is instantiated for each functional unit in the system. Secondly, additional observed symptom nodes are defined for representing the system observations. Thirdly, edges and CPTs are determined to describe the combined influences of the local faults from different functional units. In the on-line process, the real-time data are sampled to identify the states of the observed symptom nodes in the HOOBN. If the observed symptom nodes are detected to be abnormal, the HOOBN conducts the backward inference to calculate the posterior probabilities of all fault nodes based on Eq. (1). The faults with higher posterior probabilities are more suspected than those with lower posterior probabilities. (1) P F S obs = P F P S obs F ∑ P F P S obs F where P F is the prior probability distribution of the fault nodes, P S obs F is state distribution of the observed symptom nodes given the states of the fault nodes. Moreover, the states of the hidden symptom nodes are estimated based on Eq. (2). Based on the states of the hidden symptom nodes, the fault propagation paths are transparent, which can be utilized for further commissioning. (2) P S h S obs = P F P S h F P S obs S h ∑ P F P S h F P S obs S h where P S h F is the state distribution of the hidden symptom nodes given the states of the fault nodes. P S obs S h is the state distribution of the observed symptom nodes given the states of the observed symptom nodes. 4 Evaluation 4.1 Descriptions of the building energy system The proposed method is evaluated on a typical air conditioning system of an industrial building located in Wuhan, China. The air conditioning system has 51 AHUs distributed in nine zones. The floor plan presented in Fig. 8 shows their positions marked with rectangles. Each zone is equipped with a group of AHUs. The AHUs treats the air and distributes the air into the corresponding zone to maintain the indoor temperature and humidity at the set points. The schematic of each AHU is as shown in Fig. 9 . The major components in an AHU include the air filter, cooling coil, heating coil, coil valves, humidifier, and fans. Sensors are installed to monitor the AHU operations. There are twenty-five kinds of typical AHU faults in air conditioning systems, including the electric equipment faults (e.g., fan malfunction), non-electric equipment faults (e.g., coil fouling, air filter fouling and humidifier malfunction), actuator faults (e.g., valve stuck positively/negatively) and sensor faults (e.g., reading frozen and reading with positive/negative bias). In this study, experiments are conducted to simulate the occurrence of these faults. The faulty experimental data are collected for evaluating the FD performance of the proposed method. The sampling interval is ten seconds. The descriptions, abbreviations and experiment schemes of the faults are summarized in Table 1 in Appendix C. 4.2 Results of hierarchical object oriented Bayesian network modeling Step 1: Determining the base FD classes Four base FD classes are developed for the four groups of basic elements in air conditioning systems using the approach proposed in Section 3.2.1 , as shown in Fig. 10 (a)-(d). To be specific, an electric equipment FD class is developed to diagnose the electric equipment malfunction based on the hidden symptoms of power consumption. A non-electric equipment FD class is developed to diagnose the non-electric equipment malfunction based on the hidden symptoms of functional performance. An actuator FD class is developed to diagnose the actuator stuck faults based on the hidden symptoms of actual fluid flowrate and the observed symptoms of actuator openness. A sensor FD class is developed to diagnose the sensor breakdown and drift faults based on the symptoms of sensor measurements. Step 2: Determining the derived FD classes Derived FD classes are further determined using the approach proposed in Section 3.2.2 . In air conditioning systems, electric equipment can be categorized into fixed frequency equipment and variable frequency equipment. For the fixed frequency equipment that works at a constant speed, its power consumption has the upper and lower bounds. If the measured power consumption exceeds the bounds, the corresponding symptom is supposed to be abnormal. For the variable frequency equipment, a benchmarking model is trained to identify the abnormal power consumption. Two derived FD classes are developed for the two types of electric equipment, as presented in Fig. 11 (a)-(b). Similarly, non-electric equipment is categorized into three types, i.e. heat exchangers, air filters, and humidifiers. Three derived FD classes are developed for them based on the inheritance of the non-electric equipment FD class as shown in Fig. 11 (c)-(e). Step 3: Determining the specialized FD classes Two types of functional units are included in the system, i.e. fixed frequency fan AHUs, and variable frequency fan AHUs. Two specialized FD classes are developed to diagnose the twenty-five kinds of faults in them, using the approach proposed in Section 3.2.3 . Firstly, a fixed frequency fan AHU FD class is developed, as presented in Fig. 12 . It inherits the BN fragments from the super-level FD classes. To be specific, the heat exchanger FD class is inherited for FD of the cooling and heating coils. The fixed variable equipment FD class is inherited for FD of the supply and return fans. The actuator FD class is inherited for FD of the cooling and heating coil valves. The sensor FD class, air filter FD class, and humidifier FD class are inherited for FD of the sensors, air filter, and humidifier, respectively. Additional observed symptom nodes are defined to represent more diagnostic evidences. For example, the local faults of supply fan malfunction, return air temperature T ra sensor reading with bias and supply air temperature T sa sensor reading with bias would cause high difference between T sa and T ra . Direct edges are developed to describe the combined influences of these local faults. The operation patterns of the variable frequency fan AHUs and fixed frequency fan AHUs are similar. The action and propagation behaviors of some faults are similar or even identical in the two types of AHUs. Therefore, the variable frequency fan AHU FD class is determined by modifying the fixed frequency fan AHU FD class. On the one hand, the sub-networks for fan FD are altered by replacing the BN fragments inherited from the fixed frequency equipment FD class with the BN fragments inherited from the variable frequency equipment FD class (marked in red dashed line border). On the other hand, the variable frequency fan AHUs adjust the supply fan for maintaining the air enthalpy of the zone at its set point. Thus, an observed symptom node is added to monitor the return air enthalpy (marked in red solid line border). In this way, the variable frequency fan AHU FD class is quickly developed without repeated modeling, as shown in Fig. 13 . Step 4: Determining the HOOBN Constructing HOOBNs for the entire industrial building is challenging, as numerous AHUs are involved, and the AHUs in different zones follow different control strategies. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed method, a HOOBN is developed to diagnose the faults in the air conditioning system for the zone Ⅶ. There are nine AHUs (denoted as K32-40) in this air conditioning system. K32 and K37 are variable frequency fan AHUs. The other AHUs are fixed frequency fan AHUs. A HOOBN is generated for the air conditioning system, using the approach proposed in Section 3.3 . Objects are instantiated for diagnosing the faults in the nine AHUs of the air conditioning system, as presented in Fig. 14 . The AHUs operate together for environment management of the zone Ⅶ, thus two observed symptoms are additionally defined to monitor the behaviors of the averaged zone temperature T zone,avg and averaged zone humidity H zone,avg in the zone VII. 4.3 Results of the hierarchical object oriented Bayesian network-based fault diagnosis This section evaluates the FD performance of the proposed method based on the experimental data. System operational data are sampled to determine the states of the observed symptom nodes. When the symptoms remain abnormal for more than ten minutes, the HOOBN conducts backward inference to obtain the posterior probabilities of all fault nodes. If a fault has a posterior probability that is significantly higher than the others, the fault is the only reason for explaining the abnormal symptoms. If two or more faults have high posterior probabilities, a ranking list of the suspected faults is provided based on the posterior probabilities. Due to the high similarity between the two types of the AHUs, their FD results are identical, as presented in Fig. 15 . It demonstrates that most of the faults are diagnosed correctly with high posterior probabilities. Five cases are introduced in detail for demonstrations. Case 1: K34 cooling coil valve stuck fully closed In this case, the fault of K34 cooling coil valve stuck fully closed is conducted by mechanically fixing the valve at 0%. As shown in Fig. 16 , the cooling coil outlet air temperature T cc of K34 is detected to be obviously higher than the predicted value T cc,predict for more than ten minutes. During this period, the cooling coil valve openness U cc is adjusted to be maximum. Though the difference between the return air temperature T ra and the zone set point T zone,set remains within the threshold. T ra increases continuously. With the above-mentioned evidences as inputs, the posterior probability of the fault node \u201cK34-Cooling coil valve FD-Actuator fault\u201d being in the state \u201cstuck negatively\u201d is 100.0%. This fault is successfully isolated. The state of the hidden symptom node \u201cK34-Cooling coil valve FD-Abnormal fluid flowrate\u201d is estimated to be \u201clow\u201d with the belief of 100.0%. The fault propagation path is presented in Fig. 17 . Case 2: K34 cooling coil valve stuck fully open In this case, the fault of K34 cooling coil valve stuck fully open is conducted by mechanically fixing the valve at 100%. As shown in Fig. 18 , T cc of K34 is detected to be lower than T cc,predict for more than ten minutes. Though U cc is adjusted to be minimum, T ra is lower than T zone,set . With the above-mentioned evidences as inputs, the posterior probability of the fault node \u201cK34-Cooling coil valve FD-Actuator fault\u201d being in the state \u201cstuck positively\u201d is 80.0%. The posterior probabilities of other fault nodes are less than 10%. The fault of \u201cK34 cooling coil valve stuck positively\u201d is isolated. The state of the hidden symptom node \u201cK34-Cooling coil valve FD-Abnormal fluid flowrate\u201d is estimated to be \u201chigh\u201d with the belief of 80.0%. The fault propagation path is presented in Fig. 19 . Case 3: K38 cooling coil fouling In this case, the fault of K38 cooling coil fouling is conducted by wrapping the coil with towels. As shown in Fig. 20 , T cc of K38 is detected to be higher than T cc,predict for more than ten minutes. U cc is adjusted as small openness. T ra is lower than T zone,set . It indicates that the current cooling load of the zone Ⅶ is small. Though the cooling coil is fouling, the air conditioning requirement still can be satisfied. With the above-mentioned evidences as inputs, the posterior probability of the fault node \u201cK38-Cooling coil FD-Non-electric equipment fault\u201d being in the state \u201cfaulty\u201d is 84.0%. The posterior probabilities of other fault nodes are less than 10%. The fault of \u201cK38 cooling coil fouling\u201d is isolated. The fault propagation path is presented in Fig. 21 . Case 4: K38 supply fan malfunction The K38 supply fan operates at a constant speed of 30 Hz. In fault-free conditions, the supply air flowrate F sa remains within the range of 5\u201313 m3/s. The supply fan power consumption W sf remains within the range of 12\u201320 kW. In this case, F sa remains normal while W sf increase sharply, as shown in Fig. 22 . With the above-mentioned evidences as inputs, the posterior probability of the fault node \u201cK38-Supply fan FD-Non-electric equipment fault\u201d being in the state \u201cfaulty\u201d is 100.0%. This fault is successfully isolated. The fault propagation path is presented in Fig. 23 . Case 5: K38 supply air temperature sensor reading with negative bias In this case, the fault of K38 supply air temperature sensor reading with negative bias is conducted by manually changing the sensor module: T sa,measured = T sa,actual - 5 °C. As shown in Fig. 24 , the difference of T sa and T ra is larger than 7 °C for more than ten minutes. The heating coil outlet air temperature T hc is detected to be higher than T sa , which never happens in fault-free conditions. Both T ra and T zone,avg maintain at T zone,set . It indicates that the measurements of T ra sensor are correct. With the above-mentioned evidences as inputs, the posterior probability of the fault node \u201cK38-Supply air temperature sensor FD-Sensor fault\u201d being in the state \u201creading with negative bias\u201d is 65.0%. The posterior probabilities of other fault nodes are less than 10%. The fault of \u201cK38 supply air temperature sensor reading with negative bias\u201d is isolated. The fault propagation path is presented in Fig. 25 . 4.4 Discussions The evaluation results show that the proposed HOOBN-based method is powerful in establishing effective system-level FD models. The twenty-five kinds of typical faults in the air conditioning system are diagnosed correctly with high posterior probabilities. Compared with the conventional FD methods, the proposed method has the following advantages. \u2022 The conventional knowledge-driven methods are lack of generality. The proposed method shows great advantages in flexibility and adaptability. It develops modular and standard BN fragments in Bayesian FD classes, which are applicable to various building energy systems. A HOOBN can be quickly constructed for a building energy system by reusing and combining these BN fragments. Therefore, the modeling complexity is reduced significantly. The evaluation results show that the integrated HOOBN has high diagnosis accuracy and reliability. \u2022 The conventional data-driven methods are mostly based on black boxes. They are lack of interpretability and reliability, which are the advantages of the proposed method. The decision process of diagnosing the faults is represented based on the graphical structures of the HOOBN. Experts can analyze their reliability and outline the fault propagation paths for decision making of maintenance and commissioning. \u2022 Compared with the conventional object oriented BN methods, the proposed method incorporate inheritance to support incremental construction. Such implementation can avoid inconsistent or repeated modeling. For instance, the target air conditioning system include two types of AHUs which have similar but not identical operation patterns and fault action behaviors. The BN fragments for them are supposed to be similar. Therefore, the BN fragment for one of them is determined based on the modification of the BN fragment for the other. It proves that both of them work efficiently. Such approach further reduces the modeling difficulty for complex system FD. 5 Conclusions This paper provides a general framework for establishing system-level fault diagnosis models without repeated works. Bayesian fault diagnosis classes are developed in hierarchy, each of which contains a Bayesian network fragment for local fault diagnosis. The sub-classes are allowed to inherit the Bayesian network fragments from their super-classes. For various building energy systems, objects are instantiated by reusing the Bayesian network fragments in the classes. They are combined to generate hierarchical object oriented Bayesian networks for system-level fault diagnosis. Results show that the proposed method is powerful in establishing customized fault diagnosis solutions for large-scale and complex building energy systems. The Bayesian fault diagnosis class hierarchy provides standard and reusable fault diagnosis sub-models at different abstraction levels. It has high generality and can be applied in various building energy systems. The implementation of inheritance makes it easier to develop groups of Bayesian fault diagnosis classes that are similar but not identical. It avoids inconsistencies between similar classes. A hierarchical object oriented Bayesian network is generated for the targeted air conditioning system based on the Bayesian fault diagnosis classes. The hierarchical object oriented Bayesian network is proven to have good fault diagnosis performance. Most of the typical faults are diagnosed correctly, including the faults of coil fouling, coil valve stuck, fan malfunction, and sensor reading with bias. Fault propagation paths are outlined based on the Bayesian network structure and the calculated posterior probabilities. The proposed method has high reliability and good interpretability. Similar methods could be applied to other types of energy systems, such as district energy systems, district heating and cooling systems, etc. CRediT authorship contribution statement Tingting Li: Conceptualization, Methodology, Software, Validation, Writing \u2013 original draft, Writing \u2013 review & editing.

        "dc:description": "Bayesian network is a powerful algorithm to diagnose the faults in building energy systems based on incomplete and uncertain diagnostic information. In practice, it is very challenging to construct Bayesian networks for large-scale and complex systems. Inspired by the object oriented programming technology, a hierarchical object oriented Bayesian network-based method is proposed in this study. Its basic idea is to reuse the standard Bayesian network fragments predefined in the classes to generate the system-level fault diagnosis models for target systems. Inheritance is adopted to avoid inconsistent modeling of similar classes. It allows sub-classes to inherit the Bayesian network fragments from their super-classes. For a specific building energy system, the fragments are reused and combined to generate a hierarchical object oriented Bayesian network for real-time fault diagnosis. The proposed method is evaluated using the experimental data from an industrial building. The results show that the proposed method can provide customized fault diagnosis solutions for complex building energy systems without tedious and repeated modeling works. Most of the typical faults are successfully isolated.",
