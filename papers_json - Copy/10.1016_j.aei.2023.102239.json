Department of Global Smart City Sungkyunkwan University Suwon 16419 South Korea Graphical abstract Digital twin-enabled building operations heavily rely on a building sensor network to collect operational data. Virtual sensing, in combination with physical sensors, has great potential in establishing a reliable and informative sensing environment. However, physical sensors can experience hardware errors or systematic errors due to the working environment within building systems. Virtual sensors are also subject to their model uncertainties arising from input physical sensor errors and changes in system operations. These virtual sensor errors have a negative effect on the in-situ calibration accuracy of corresponding physical sensors. To address these issues, this study proposes a simultaneous in-situ calibration (SIC) method designed to calibrate multiple physical and virtual sensors with varying errors in the context of digital twins. The SIC problem is mathematically formulated, including two types of distance functions (direct and indirect) and defining correction functions to calibrate various types of virtual sensors (such as backup, validation, replacement/virtualization, and observation sensors). Importantly, the proposed method tackles the challenges posed by the unknown calibration environment in operational systems. A field application study was conducted for two physical sensors and three different virtual sensors operating in a district heating substation serving real residential buildings in Korea. The case study shows how the different calibration accuracies for each sensor depend on the calibration approaches, such as physical-targeted (existing Case 1), virtual-targeted (existing Case 2), and simultaneous calibration (novel Case 3). Under the simultaneous errors, only Case 3 satisfied the reference accuracy for all sensors. Specifically, the average MAEs in Case 3 were improved by approximately 79.3%, 75.3%, 63.9%, and 87.5% for the target physical sensor, backup virtual sensor, virtualized sensor, and validation virtual sensor, respectively, compared to the accuracies before calibration. These results demonstrate the importance and effectiveness of simultaneous in-situ calibration of physical and virtual sensors in digital twin-enabled building operations. The proposed calibration can contribute to the synchronization of physical and virtual building systems, thus achieving reliable and informative virtual sensing-driven digital twins.

In the International Energy Agency (IEA), buildings are described as \u201ca source of enormous untapped efficiency potential\u201d and digitalization is regarded as \u201ca way to make energy systems smarter, more connected, efficient, and resilient.\u201d A report by the IEA [2] highlighted the synergy between buildings and digitalization in the context of carbon neutrality. Building digitalization, including concepts such as digital twins (DT), cyber-physical systems (CPS), and building information modeling (BIM), can be realized through the orchestration of data, information, and operational models [3]. It can be intended to play a role as an omniscient building controller over the building life cycle and a digital infrastructure for data-driven building energy and automation applications. The original concept of digital twins is defined as a set of information constructs that provide a comprehensive and detailed description of a physical product, embracing both micro-atomic to the macro-geometrical levels [4]. The digital twin consists of a physical asset and a digital asset, interconnected to enable seamless flows of data, information, and process. The digital twin concept has recently been discussed in the field of building operations, alongside BIM [3,5,6]. Compared to the concept of BIM, the digital twin places a greater emphasis on data and behavioral models specifically during the building operation phase [6\u20139]. When modeling the digital twin in buildings, it is essential to consider the unique characteristics of buildings, which are massive, designed based on specific requirements, constructed in the field, equipped with diverse systems and equipment, and operated over long periods [10]. In this context, the concept of in situ digital twinning refers to the continuous process of modeling a digital twin that is utilized throughout the building life cycle to construct and verify the mathematical or digital twin models, with the ultimate goal of achieving a comprehensive digital twin environment that accurately represents the building and its operations [3]. This concept can be implemented using in situ model fusion techniques [11] and the information obtained from BIM throughout the building's life cycle. By establishing such a comprehensive digital twin environment in terms of operational data, information and models with BIM, intelligent building operation applications can be effectively developed and operated, leveraging the benefits provided by the digital twin concept. These applications enable real-time and remote monitoring and control, holistic observations, prediction and simulation, maintenance and diagnosis, and optimization throughout the long-term building operations. With the advancement of artificial intelligence and big data analysis, digital twin-enabled building energy management and automation systems have been developed to improve energy efficiency and indoor environmental quality [12]. Various building technologies, including prediction [13], fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) [14], control [15], operational analytics [16], and optimization [17], have been studied with a focus on data-driven approaches [18] within the digital twins. The successful implementation of these digital twin-enabled and data-driven applications relies on the availability of operational datasets obtained from a building sensor network. The sensor network in a building system consists of various physical sensors under closed control and application loops. The control feedback sensor in the closed control loop plays a key role, and its minor errors can significantly reduce building energy efficiency and performance [19]. Sensors employed for applications provide operational data for the analysis, diagnosis, and forecasting of building performance [20,21]. These physical sensors are integral to the implementation of digital twinning and digital twin-enabled applications in building operations. With a considerable increase in the dependence of DT on the building sensor network, a reliable sensing environment is required in building operations. However, physical sensing environments are prone to be unstable and uninformative owing to various uncertainties during long-term operations [22,23]. The size of a typical building system is extensive and heterogeneous, resulting in low-cost physical sensor deployments, heterogeneous sensors with different qualities and resolutions, and the absence or low redundancy of physical sensors. This causes the sensing environment in building operations to be limited. In addition, various sensor errors, such as noise, offset, drift, and systematic errors, appear owing to hardware and communication faults and working environments in physical systems. For example, a monitoring sensor (chilled return water temperature sensor) with intermittent drift errors appears in a central-cooling system [22]. The air supply temperature sensor of the air conditioner in the air handling unit (AHU) showed an error bias of up to 19.2 °C because of the compact space and thermal radiation environment [23]. These limited and unreliable sensing environments negatively affect data-driven applications in cyber systems. Therefore, a novel sensing system is required to enable digital twin and cyber-physical systems, considering the inherent building characteristics. Virtual sensing or virtual sensors have huge potential for digital twins, particularly in building operations, because they can extend the physical sensing coverage and serve as a proxy for faulty physical sensors in massive buildings during long-term operations [24]. In other words, virtual sensing is very important for building sensing environments that are informative and reliable when using the digital layer of buildings. Virtual sensors are mathematical models that predict physical variables, building performance, system states, and intended indicators that are difficult to measure using existing or single physical sensors [25]. Their applications include backup [26,27], validation [28], replacement/virtualization [28], and observation [29] of targets. Based on their modeling environments, such as laboratory, manufacturing, and field, they can be categorized as built-in and in-situ virtual sensors [24]. The observation virtual sensor predicts unmeasured variables or performance indicators without its physical counterpart. Backup is a proxy for the target physical sensor, thus providing residuals between virtual and physical sensors for fault detection, diagnosis, and calibration. Virtualization is the replacement of faulty physical sensors with prebuilt backup virtual sensors. Validation virtual sensors are used for the indirect verification and validation of other observations and virtualized sensors. These functions are utilized to observe physical and semantic environments, extend sensing coverage, and reduce the maintenance and installation of physical sensors. In previous studies on virtual-sensing applications, virtual sensors have been widely applied to monitoring [26,30], FDD [31,32], optimal control [33], and in-situ calibration [34] of other sensors in building systems. For example, Hong et al. [27] proposed a system-level virtual sensing method using an autoencoder within a limited sensing environment in a building operating system. Kim et al. [32] proposed a virtual sensor-assisted heat exchanger fouling detection method for district heating substations. Ran et al. [33] proposed a virtual sensor-based self-adjusting control strategy to respond to the power demand in HVAC systems using a virtual flowmeter model in a commercial building. Finally, Yoon emphasized that \u201cvirtual sensors are no longer just virtual ones in the digital twins and virtual reality of buildings\u201d in [24]. Nevertheless, there are research challenges in virtual-sensing-driven digital twins. Virtual sensors must be continuously calibrated and managed during operation because the physical building environment naturally changes with age, and thus, the gap between cyber and physical systems breaks. In this situation, the mathematical models for virtual sensors can have operational uncertainties and the physical sensors used for the inputs of a target virtual sensor can be faulty with various operational errors. These challenges require in-situ calibration of virtual sensors during operation. It is essential to consider the interactions between physical and virtual sensors during the calibration process. Thus, in-situ virtual sensor calibration should include related physical sensors, which can be regarded as in-situ sensors and model calibration. In this study, this was defined as simultaneous in-situ calibration. 1.1 Literature reviews Previous studies have been conducted on sensor fault detection, diagnosis, and estimation (SFDD&E) [35,36], virtual calibration [23,37], virtual in-situ calibration (VIC) [38,39], and in-situ sensor calibration [34,40] in building systems. They intended to detect, diagnose, and estimate sensor faults in the context of in-situ sensor calibration in operational building systems. Specifically, SFDD&E was proposed to detect, diagnose, estimate, and reconstruct the erroneous sensor data [36,41] using principal-component analysis method. This method is applied to a single physical sensor. Virtual calibration was proposed to calibrate systematic errors of the supply air temperature sensor installed in rooftop air conditioning units [23,37]. This necessitates an experimental environment to identify the systematic errors and formulate a correction function for the determined errors. The concept of VIC was proposed to enable in-situ sensor calibration for a single physical sensor in operational building systems [38]. Then, Yoon and Yu [39] proposed an extended VIC that corrects systematic and random errors for multiple physical sensors installed in building systems. The VIC methods eliminate the need for an experimental environment required for calibration in virtual calibration methods. Subsequently, the VIC studies have been conducted on various building operating systems, including air handling units [42], absorption refrigerators [43], photovoltaic heat pump systems [44], and data center cooling systems [45]. More recently, the VIC methods have also been applied to virtual sensors working in operational building systems [28,46]. For example, Koo et al. [46] proposed an in-situ calibration method for a backup virtual sensor in a central heating system. Koo and Yoon [28] proposed an indirect in-situ calibration method to correct a virtualized sensor without a direct benchmark. These previous studies have made progress in transitioning from single sensors to multiple sensors, from physical sensors to virtual sensors, and from constant errors to varying errors including systematic errors. However, they have not yet addressed the issue of simultaneous in-situ calibration for both physical and virtual sensors with varying sensor errors in the digital twin context. Table 1 presents a summary of the literature reviews conducted on in-situ sensor calibration in building systems. 1.2 Objective, research question, and contributions Therefore, the objective of this study is to propose a simultaneous in-situ calibration method capable of calibrating multiple physical and virtual sensors with varying errors in the context of digital twins. The main research question revolves around formulating the calibration problem, specifically addressing distance functions and correction functions, for both physical and virtual sensors including various types such as backup, validation, replacement/virtualization, and observation sensors. This problem is formulated to accommodate the unknown calibration environment, where the status of sensors (faulty or normal) is unknown, the physical sensors used as benchmarks or inputs for backup virtual sensors may also contain errors, and there is a lack of direct benchmark data for calibrating virtual sensors (observation and virtualization) in operational systems. To tackle these challenges, the proposed method formulates individual distance functions (such as a direct distance and an indirect one) to cover physical sensors and different virtual sensors\u2014backup, validation, observation, and virtualized sensors\u2014in the calibration process. This study also suggests approaches to defining correction functions for these two distance function types. Bayesian inference is introduced to solve the simultaneous in-situ calibration problem. A field application study was conducted to examine the impact of calibration approaches, such as physical-targeted, virtual-targeted, and simultaneous calibration, on calibration accuracies. This case study shows the importance and effectiveness of simultaneous in-situ calibration of cyber-physical systems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on simultaneous in-situ calibration in building operations. Therefore, it can initiate virtual sensing-driven digital twins in building operations and synchronization technology for real and cyber buildings. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the simultaneous calibration method and formulation are presented. In Section 3, the proposed method is applied to operational district substation systems. In Section 4, the calibration accuracies of the physical and virtual sensors are discussed based on different calibration approaches, such as physical, virtual, and simultaneous calibration. The conclusion summarizes the research findings and future studies. 2 Simultaneous in-situ calibration (SIC) 2.1 Definition and terms The SIC is defined as a simultaneous calibration process aimed at mathematically/virtually calibrating both physical and virtual sensors in the field during building operations. It is derived from the original concept of virtual in-situ calibration (VIC) [38,39]. According to the International Vocabulary of Metrology [47], the term \u201ccalibration\u201d used in the SIC might be more appropriately termed as \u201cadjustment\u201d [48] because the proposed SIC is conducted under normal operations, not the specific conditions for calibration. In contrast, the original VIC procedures [38,39] include a step of evaluating the calibration environment to identify uniformity and stability for specified calibration conditions. However, this can lead to limited calibration environments and datasets, making it time-consuming to gather all necessary benchmarks to represent the sensor's working range [38]. To overcome these difficulties, the proposed SIC method employs advanced modeling structures for benchmark and correction functions within the in-situ calibration formulation. This allows the SIC to be conducted under normal operational conditions in the field, thus covering a broader operational range for calibration. In addition to that, as the virtual sensors included in SIC are constructed using the behavioral or virtual models in the digital twin model for building operations [49], SIC involves model calibration within the physical and virtual sensor calibration process. In these contexts, the term \u201ccalibration\u201d is used in this study. 2.2 In-situ virtual sensors and their benchmark environments In-situ virtual sensors are constructed, verified/validated, operated, and calibrated on-site during building operations within the digital twin environments [49]. They are modeled in the field using relative physical measurements ( M r ) , other virtual measurements ( M r ) \u2026 , control signals ( C s ) , and device specifications ( D s ) in the operating systems, as in Eq. (1). They consist of different applications, including observation, backup, replacement/virtualization, and validation, as described in the introduction. Fig. 1 shows the different types of in-situ virtual sensors within the digital twin model. For in-situ virtual sensors in building operation, based on the benchmark environments\u2014observed or unobserved benchmarks in calibration\u2014the in-situ calibration approach is classified into two categories: (1) direct in-situ calibration and (2) indirect in-situ calibration. The in-situ backup virtual sensors ( M \u2026 B ) in the building operation have physical counterparts for the backup of the target physical sensor. Validation virtual sensors ( M \u2026 V V ) also have physical counterparts for the indirect validation of virtualized sensors ( M \u2026 V ) and in-situ observation virtual sensors ( M \u2026 O ). Accordingly, in-situ backup virtual sensors and validation virtual sensors can be conducted by direct in-situ calibration using a direct benchmark. However, in-situ observation virtual sensors and virtualized sensors in building operations have no physical counterparts owing to physical sensor faults and the absence of direct physical benchmarks. In-situ observation of virtual sensors and virtualized sensors without direct benchmarks can be conducted by indirect in-situ calibration using indirect benchmarks (mentioned in Section 2.2). Table 2 shows the in-situ calibration approaches for each of the in-situ virtual sensors in building operations. (1) M \u2026 n = V S ( M r , M \u2026 r , C s , D s ) 2.3 Simultaneous in-situ calibration (SIC) formulation The simultaneous in-situ calibration of the building operating systems was conducted for five types of working sensors: physical sensors, observation virtual sensors, backup virtual sensors, virtualized sensors, and validation virtual sensors. The in-situ calibration problem is mathematically formulated as a distance function using direct or indirect benchmarks for each calibration target sensor. 2.3.1 Direct distance function The direct distance function was formulated as shown in Eq. (2) to calibrate the sensors with counterparts/benchmarks, such as physical sensors and in-situ backup sensors. The direct distance function is defined as the difference between the corrected values of both the target physical sensor and the backup virtual sensor with a calibration reference parameter. The correction values are added to the physical sensors and backup virtual sensor to compensate for their hidden measurement errors, as shown in Eq. (3). Note that the physical sensors related to the inputs of the target backup virtual sensor are included in SIC formation. The correction variables (C) are defined by a correction function (g) with the correction parameters (xc ) and the input features (X), or simply by a single constant, as in Eq. (4). It is important to define an appropriate correction function, including the correction parameters and input features, to cover a wider operation area with good calibration accuracy. The calibration reference parameter ( δ ) was proposed to prevent over-calibration, which degrades the calibration accuracy, considering the system operating uncertainties [28]. Finally, the target physical and backup measurement errors were calibrated directly from each other\u2019s correction variables. The direct distance functions are individually defined as D t d x c for each measurement interval in the time-series operational dataset (t). (2) D t d x c = M \u2026 c B - M c B - δ B 2 (3) M \u2026 c B = V S M c I + C vs B M c B = M B + C phy B , a n d M c I = M I + C phy I (4) C = g ( X , x c ) o r C = x c 2.3.2 Indirect distance function In-situ observation virtual sensors and virtualized sensors have no physical counterparts owing to physical sensor faults and the absence of physical benchmarks. Therefore, it is impossible to directly verify and calibrate virtual sensor models. To overcome this challenge, the indirect distance function is formulated, as shown in Eq. (5) to calibrate sensors with no counterparts/benchmarks, such as observation virtual sensors and virtualized sensors. The indirect distance function is defined by the difference between the corrected values of both the validation virtual sensor and its physical counterpart with a calibration reference parameter. The hypothesis is that the target virtual sensors (observation and virtualized sensors) are well calibrated when the validation difference ( D t ind ) is close to the reference value ( δ vv ). To achieve this hypothesis, the target virtual sensor output must be inserted into one of the validation virtual sensor inputs ( M \u2026 c V V ), as shown in Eq. (6), and the physical counterpart ( M V V ) of the validation virtual sensor was assumed to be accurate in the formulation. The validation virtual sensor was formulated as shown in Eq. (6), and it was directly calibrated with the target virtual sensors ( M \u2026 c I n ), as shown in Eq. (7) in the indirect distance function of SIC. The indirect distance functions are individually defined as D t ind for each measurement interval in the time-series operational dataset (t).

Therefore, the assumption mentioned in Section 2.3.2 can be effective for the indirect calibration approach. 2.4 Correction function (g) The correction function is defined by the correction parameters and input features with mathematical expressions, such as polynomial equations, to correct various sensor errors such as random, bias, and drift errors in building operations. The input features are determined based on the mathematical relationships with the errors, and the correction parameters are then estimated using the parameter estimation process. 2.4.1 Input features of the correction function in the direct distance function The input feature for the physical sensors and backup virtual sensors in the direct distance function is defined using the difference between the corrected benchmark and the target value, as shown in Eq. (8). During the calibration process, the corrected values for the physical and backup virtual sensors were close to each other. Under these conditions, the correction variables ( C phy B and C vs B ) can be formulated by the difference between their corrected benchmark and themselves ( ( M \u2026 B + C vs B ) - M B or ( M B + C phy B ) - M \u2026 B ). Finally, the differences ( M \u2026 c B - M B or M c B - M \u2026 B ) were defined as the input features, considering that the correction variables depend on their input features. M B + C phy B ≅ M \u2026 B + C vs B C phy B ≅ ( M \u2026 B + C vs B ) - M B C vs B ≅ ( M B + C phy B ) - M \u2026 B X phy B ∝ ( M \u2026 c B - M B ) (8) X vs B ∝ ( M c B - M \u2026 B ) The input feature for the validation virtual sensor is defined in Eq. (9) by the direct residual between the virtual and physical values because the physical measurements are assumed to be accurate according to Remark 1 in the SIC. M \u2026 V V + C vs VV ≅ M VV C vs VV ≅ ( M VV - M \u2026 V V ) (9) X vs VV ∝ ( M VV - M \u2026 V V ) 2.4.2 Input features of the correction function in the indirect distance function The input features for the observation and virtualized sensors in the indirect distance function are defined in Eqs. (10) and (11) by their measurement, related variable, or validation residual. For virtualized sensors, it is possible to determine the appropriate input features using correlation analysis with the observed residuals between the physical and backup virtual sensors before sensor virtualization.

The SIC problem is solved to estimate the accurate correction parameters using Bayesian inference [50]. Bayesian inference calculates the posterior distributions of the correction parameters based on their prior distributions and likelihood functions, as shown in Eq. (12). It is suitable for the unknown calibration environment of SIC in operational systems. First, the prior distributions of the correction parameters are defined by a normal distribution [51] with a zero mean if there is no information about the physical and virtual sensor errors before the calibration. This is based on the hypothesis that the normal sensor probability is typically higher than the faulty sensor probability. In the context of continuous calibration, the posteriors from the SIC can be used as priors for the next SIC. Second, the likelihood function is defined as the product of all individual conditional probability distributions. The conditional probability distributions are defined for each of the direct and indirect distance functions, at multiple timestamps during the calibration period, using a Gaussian distribution with a mean of zero. Thus, the likelihood probability is maximized when determining the correction parameters that minimize all distance functions during the calibration period. Finally, correction parameters are defined by the mean or median values of the calculated posterior distributions. According to the previous study [52], a Bayesian method showed superior calibration performance compared to the deterministic method in the case of in-situ calibration of multiple sensors within an unknown calibration environment.

The target heating system is divided into a primary side that receives district heating water sources and a secondary side that provides heat sources to the residential units. The heat sources are transferred to the secondary-side water across the heat exchanger between the two sides. The target system was integrated with a digital twin-based building automation system (BAS), as shown in Fig. 2. This BAS was developed using wireless communications and sensor networks with an RS485 interface. It was operated to enable real-time monitoring of both physical and virtual sensor measurements, to control the secondary-side supply water temperature through the implementation of the outdoor temperature reset control method, and to control the differential pressure between the supply and return pressures on the secondary side. Operational datasets, including sensor measurements and control signals, were obtained at 1-minute intervals over 90 days in the winter (November 2021\u2013February 2022) using the BAS. Table 3 lists the key design parameters of the target district heating system. 3.2 Application scenario with physical and virtual sensors Physical sensors were installed with four water temperature sensors and two pressure sensors in the target system operation, as shown in Fig. 2. In-situ virtual sensors, including backup, virtualization, and validation, were applied to temperature sensors. A backup virtual sensor ( T \u2026 1 , r e t B ) was developed for the primary-side return temperature sensor. The secondary-side return temperature sensor was virtualized using its backup virtual sensor ( T \u2026 2 , r e t B ), which was the virtualized sensor in this scenario and was applied to the proposed SIC. A validation virtual sensor ( T \u2026 2 , s u p V V ) was made for the secondary-side supply temperature to conduct indirect calibration for the virtualized sensor ( T \u2026 2 , r e t V ) without the physical benchmark. According to Remark 1, the physical counterpart sensor for the secondary-side supply temperature ( T 2 , s u p VV ) was assumed to operate accurately during this period. In the deployment of virtual sensors, only a physical sensor for the primary-side return temperature sensor is included in the SIC. To implement the physical sensor error scenario in a real system, an artificial sensor error of + 1 °C is applied to the physical sensor after January. In-situ virtual sensors naturally have various operational errors caused by operational system uncertainties, virtual sensor model uncertainties, and given physical sensor errors. Virtual sensor errors can be found in the results before calibration, as discussed in Section 4. Table 4 summarizes the physical and virtual sensors included in the SIC for this application. The operational scenarios and their periods for in-situ virtual sensor modeling, initial operations before calibration, SIC, and operations after calibration were designed in the winter, as summarized in Table 5 . 3.3 In-situ virtual sensors modeling The in-situ virtual sensors were modeled by a data-driven modeling approach using a multilayer neural network with related physical measurements and control signals available in the BAS dataset for the virtual sensor development period (30 days). A multilayer perceptron (MLP) was designed with the hyperparameters listed in Table 6 for training the virtual sensor models. For training, the operating datasets were normalized using min\u2013max normalization [53]. The input variables of each in-situ virtual sensor were defined from the relative system variables available in the target system, as listed in Table 4. The target physical sensor measurement with a fault condition was used as the input variable for the virtualized and validation virtual sensors. The virtualized sensor measurement was used as one of the input variables of the validation virtual sensor. The accuracy of the developed in-situ virtual sensors was evaluated using the mean absolute error (MAE) index, as shown in Eq. (13). The in-situ virtual sensors ( T \u2026 1 , r e t B , T \u2026 2 , r e t B , a n d T \u2026 2 , s u p V V ) showed 0.276 °C, 0.372 °C, and 0.331 °C, respectively, during the training period. The developed in-situ virtual sensors were operated for the remaining 60 days in winter. (13) MAE = ∑ t = 1 T M t - M \u2026 t T 3.4 In-situ calibration cases with their formulation Cases were made in this application to show the SIC effectiveness compared to the non-simultaneous in-situ calibration for either the physical sensor or virtual sensors. In Case 1, in-situ calibration was conducted only for the physical sensor. Case 2 was performed only for the virtual sensors. Case 3 is the proposed SIC for both physical and virtual sensors in this study. Based on the calibration targets for each case, as expressed in Eq. (14), direct and/or indirect distance functions were formulated, and the likelihood functions were then defined with the corresponding distance functions with multiple timestamps for a calibration period (12 days). The calibration reference parameters ( δ ) were determined to be 0.343 only for the direct distance term in Cases 1 and 2. Case 3 did not have δ because the differences between the physical and virtual sensors could be minimized during simultaneous calibration.

Correction functions were applied only to the physical and/or sensors targeted in each case. First, based on Eq. (8) in Section 2.4.1, the input features for the target physical and backup sensors were defined by their corrected counterparts in the linear equation. Then, for the virtualized sensor, the input feature was defined by its own measurement because the residuals between the physical and backup virtual sensors, which were observed during the initial normal operation period before virtualization, were more correlated to the virtualized sensor measurement rather than the validation residuals, as shown in Fig. 3 . Based on the correlation distribution, the correction function was defined using a quadratic equation with the features of the virtualized sensor measurement. Finally, the correction function for the validation virtual sensor was defined by a linear equation with a feature of the residual with its physical counterpart. The Bayesian inference for in-situ calibration cases was solved using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to overcome the challenge in the calculation of the normalization constant ( P ( Y ) ). To do so, Bayesian MCMC sampling was conducted using the Metropolis\u2013Hastings algorithm [54,55]. Problem-solving was implemented using Python 3.9. The priors of the correction parameters were defined by a normal distribution of a zero mean and a standard deviation of 0.50, based on the acceptance rates of Bayesian MCMC. Table 8 shows the given prior distributions and estimated posterior distributions using Bayesian MCMC for all cases. The correction parameters in the correction functions were defined by the mean values of the posterior distributions in all the cases. 4 Results and discussions 4.1 Importance of simultaneous calibration for physical and virtual sensors Fig. 4 shows the daily MAE distribution for the in-situ virtual sensors during the initial operation period. The daily MAE distribution for the in-situ virtual sensors was calculated based on the residuals of the virtual measurements and physical benchmarks. The average MAE of all in-situ virtual sensors showed larger errors than the MAE during the development period. In particular, the average MAE of the in-situ backup virtual sensor ( T \u2026 2 , r e t B ) was 0.66 °C, which was significantly higher than the MAE in the development period. This shows the bias and random errors for the in-situ virtual sensors modeled by the limited dataset from the actual operating environment. Fig. 5 shows the daily MAE distribution for the in-situ virtual sensors under the faulty physical sensor for the calibration formulation period without calibration. Note that the physical measurements for the virtualized sensor were only applied for the MAE evaluation, which was not used for the calibration process. The in-situ backup virtual sensor, virtualized sensor, and validation virtual sensor showed the MAEs of 1.25 °C, 1.47 °C, and 1.22 °C, respectively. The in-situ backup virtual sensor showed a large MAE from the physical benchmarks with a fault. The virtualized and validation virtual sensors showed significant errors owing to the input values from the faulty physical sensor measurements. These results show the in-situ virtual measurement errors caused by operational physical sensor errors in actual building operations. This means that simultaneous calibration of physical and virtual sensors is essential, especially for in-situ virtual sensors applied in digital twin-enabled building operations. 4.2 In-situ calibration results with different calibration approaches Fig. 6 shows the physical and in-situ virtual sensor accuracies before and after calibration during the calibration period. For the calibration period in Case 1, the target physical sensor ( T 1 , r e t B ) was calculated with a low MAE of 0.220 °C. The in-situ backup virtual sensor, the virtualized sensor, and the validation virtual sensor showed an MAE of 0.410 °C, 0.786 °C, and 0.448 °C, respectively, after individual calibration of the physical sensor. This shows the calibration effect of the physical sensor in virtual and physical sensor systems. In Case 2, the in-situ backup virtual sensor, the virtualized sensor, and the validation virtual sensor showed an MAE of 0.895 °C, 0.929 °C, and 0.381 °C, respectively. The in-situ backup virtual sensor and the virtualized sensor indicated relatively higher MAEs even after calibration. They did not show a calibration improvement greater than that in Case 1. The validation virtual sensor was calibrated well compared to Case 1 because the physical benchmark was accurate regardless of the case. The results of Case 2 indicate that defective physical sensors in cyber-physical sensing systems deteriorate the calibration performance for in-situ virtual sensors if the calibration is done only for the virtual sensors. In Case 3, the target calibration sensors after simultaneous calibration of physical and in-situ virtual sensors showed an MAE of 0.207 °C, 0.298 °C, 0.484 °C, and 0.127 °C, respectively. Simultaneous calibration improved the errors of the target sensors by 79.3 %, 75.3 %, 63.9 %, and 87.5 %, respectively. The virtualized sensor without the benchmark can be calibrated well with the simultaneous calibration of the physical sensor and the validation virtual sensor. The proposed simultaneous calibration method provided good calibration accuracy for physical sensors and in-situ virtual sensors in an operational heating system. This case study showed how effective simultaneous calibration is compared to non-simultaneous (or individual) calibration in real operations with simultaneous uncertainties in physical and virtual sensing systems. 4.3 Validation of simultaneous in-situ calibration in building operations Compared with the accuracies between the calibration and validation periods, the accuracy improvements were more remarkable for most sensors in all cases during the validation period. In Case 3, the MAEs of the target sensors were 0.248 °C, 0.367 °C, 0.470 °C, and 0.138 °C, respectively. The errors of the target sensors were reduced by 75.2 %, 69.9 %, 65.2 %, and 87.2 %, respectively. These improvements demonstrated the calibration formulation, including distance functions, correction functions, input features, and correction parameters, thus validating the proposed simultaneous calibration capability for cyber-physical sensing systems in the context of building operation and digitalization. Fig. 7 shows the daily MAE distribution for the target physical and virtual sensors before and after calibration during the validation period. The MAE distribution for Case 3 was lower than those of Cases 1 and 2. In Case 3, the target physical sensor, the in-situ backup virtual sensor, and the validation virtual sensor continuously showed an MAE of lower than 0.50 °C during building operations. However, the MAE of virtualized virtual sensor showed accuracies larger than 0.50 °C on some days (February 4, 13, and 18) and did not show a reference MAE lower than 0.35 °C during the validation period. This indicates the challenge of an indirect calibration without a direct benchmark. Future studies can be conducted to determine a better correction function with input feature selection or calibration reference parameter in the indirect distance function. In addition, as shown in Fig. 7(a)(b), the physical sensor and the backup virtual sensor showed the greatest MAEs of 0.47 °C and 0.49 °C MAE, respectively, on February 13. This is because the correction functions with the estimated correction parameters are limited to certain operations. Considering demand changes, system aging, and energy-saving efforts, the proposed SIC should be continuously conducted to update the correction functions for all target sensors with better accuracy in long-term building operations. 5 Conclusions In the context of digital twin-enabled intelligent building operations, this study proposed a novel method for simultaneous in-situ calibration targeting physical and virtual sensors with varying errors in building operations. In the proposed method, various virtual sensor types, including backup, validation, virtualization, and observation, are covered by formulating the two distance functions (direct and indirect) and their correction functions based on their calibration benchmark environments during operation. Based on a field application study, the following recommendations are suggested: \u2022 Virtual sensor models should be continuously calibrated in operation. \u2022 Physical sensor calibration should be included in the virtual sensor calibration process. \u2022 Calibration of the benchmark model (or backup virtual sensor) should be included in the in-situ calibration of physical sensors. \u2022 Simultaneous in-situ calibration is essential, especially in a physical-cyber sensing system. Therefore, the proposed calibration method can provide reliable physical-virtual sensing for various applications and facilitates the fusion of virtual and physical sensors in building operations. If the digital twin environment is unaware of the status of working sensors or unable to calibrate their errors (especially for systematic errors), it becomes challenging to guarantee optimal building operations across various applications. Moreover, considering the virtual sensor as an integral component of the digital twin behavioral model, the proposed formulation of simultaneous in-situ calibration problem contributes to the development of a mathematical framework regarding the digital twin synchronization for physical sensors, virtual sensors, and even behavioral models throughout building operations. The accurate and synchronized digital twins enable improved building operations. Future studies will discuss the continuous calibration capability for various error conditions and operational patterns in long-term building operations. To improve the calibration applicability in actual building operating systems, an autonomous in-situ calibration method is required to automatically determine the calibration formulation, timing, and periods. Additionally, the design parameters for such autonomous algorithms should be established during the BIM-based design phase.

        "dc:description": "Digital twin-enabled building operations heavily rely on a building sensor network to collect operational data. Virtual sensing, in combination with physical sensors, has great potential in establishing a reliable and informative sensing environment. However, physical sensors can experience hardware errors or systematic errors due to the working environment within building systems. Virtual sensors are also subject to their model uncertainties arising from input physical sensor errors and changes in system operations. These virtual sensor errors have a negative effect on the in-situ calibration accuracy of corresponding physical sensors. To address these issues, this study proposes a simultaneous in-situ calibration (SIC) method designed to calibrate multiple physical and virtual sensors with varying errors in the context of digital twins. The SIC problem is mathematically formulated, including two types of distance functions (direct and indirect) and defining correction functions to calibrate various types of virtual sensors (such as backup, validation, replacement/virtualization, and observation sensors). Importantly, the proposed method tackles the challenges posed by the unknown calibration environment in operational systems. A field application study was conducted for two physical sensors and three different virtual sensors operating in a district heating substation serving real residential buildings in Korea. The case study shows how the different calibration accuracies for each sensor depend on the calibration approaches, such as physical-targeted (existing Case 1), virtual-targeted (existing Case 2), and simultaneous calibration (novel Case 3). Under the simultaneous errors, only Case 3 satisfied the reference accuracy for all sensors. Specifically, the average MAEs in Case 3 were improved by approximately 79.3%, 75.3%, 63.9%, and 87.5% for the target physical sensor, backup virtual sensor, virtualized sensor, and validation virtual sensor, respectively, compared to the accuracies before calibration. These results demonstrate the importance and effectiveness of simultaneous in-situ calibration of physical and virtual sensors in digital twin-enabled building operations. The proposed calibration can contribute to the synchronization of physical and virtual building systems, thus achieving reliable and informative virtual sensing-driven digital twins.",
