Graphical abstract The artificial earth satellites with different numbers and sizes are stored in a large clean space in the satellite factory before they are launched. The cleanliness of the satellite factory is maintained by an air-conditioning system consisting of three rows of nozzles installed on the side walls of the factory. Traditionally, all the nozzles are operated at a rated air volume regardless of the arrangement of the satellites, which results in a high energy consumption by the air circulating fans. In this study, we proposed a control method for the nozzles, based on the number and size of satellites. A CFD model was developed to simulate the cleanliness in the satellite factory and the cleanliness for different scenarios with different sizes and numbers of satellites was simulated. The control strategy and rate of reduction of the circulating air volume was obtained for different arrangements of satellites. The results show that the less circulating air volume is required when the number of satellites is small or the size is short. The total air volume can be reduced by 49.1% for a year and the energy consumption of the fan can be reduced 57.8%. This study provides a feasible method to reduce the circulating air volume, which can be used to guide the design and operation of actual projects. Keywords Satellite factory Cleanroom CFD Energy saving Air distribution 1 Introduction Cleanrooms are crucial to the development of advanced technological industries as many production processes need to be carried out in a clean environment [1,2]. With the development of related industries, the built area of cleanrooms is rapidly increasing [3]. However, the power consumption of cleanrooms is extremely high because of the demand for cleanliness; for example, the average power consumption of semiconductor fabs is 1.432 kWh/cm2 [4]. The energy consumption of cleanrooms poses a great challenge in reducing carbon emissions and the consequent impact on global climate change. Hence, there is an urgent need to reduce the energy consumption of cleanrooms. The satellite factory is a typical cleanroom with a large space where artificial earth satellites are stored before they are launched. A variety of parameters are required in the factory. Take an ISO 8 cleanroom as an example, the required particle concentration is lower than 3,520,000 pc/m3, the required temperature is 22\u202f±\u202f2\u202f°C, the required humidity is 45\u202f±\u202f10%, and the noise is not greater than 60\u202fdB(A) [5]. Cleanliness is usually the most important control parameter. Particles pose a risk of damage to sophisticated components such as satellite lenses; therefore, a large amount of circulating air volume is required to maintain the clean atmosphere in the satellite factory [6]. Efficient air distribution is essential for reducing air volume and energy consumption. In a relatively large space, Melikov [7] delivered clean air directly to the breathing zone of the user, which can significantly improve air quality with the personalized ventilation. Considering the flexibility of personalized supply air, Yang et al. [8] installed the air terminal devices to the ceiling and made a comprehensive evaluation of the practice. Liang et al. [9] studied the guarantee of local environment in large space. The local load of different air distribution is compared. These studies were conducted for air quality and thermal comfort, all of them do not involve the guarantee of cleanliness. Many researchers have performed experimental and numerical studies on air distribution in the different types of cleanrooms. Shao et al. [10] studied particle dispersion in cleanrooms of the electronics industry under different area ratios and speeds of fan filter units. Khoo et al. [11] conducted an experiment on a cleanroom with a raised-floor and studied the influence of free area ratio of the raised-floor on the particle concentration. Cheng et al. [12] investigated the airflow behaviour inside a cleanroom with vertical unidirectional flow and computationally studied the design parameters, such as porosity, height of raised floor, width of cleanroom and inlet velocity profile. Ding et al. [13] studied the influence of arrangement of air inlets on the flow field in a Class 7 cleanroom and provided a practical guide on the design arrangement of inlets. Lin et al. [14] proposed a new form of air distribution, namely fan dry coil unit return system, that can remove particles more effectively compared with traditional ventilation systems. Yang et al. [15] studied three different ventilation schemes of an ISO Class 5 clean ward and suggested ways to optimize the air distribution. So far, no open publication can be found on the research of the energy saving of satellite factory. Although some results from cleanrooms can be applied to satellite factories, there is a significant difference between satellite factory and other cleanrooms. The satellite factory is normally a large space and the indoor parameters are non-uniform. The cleanliness in the local zones around the satellites is the most important parameter for the satellites, which should be the main control objective of the air-conditioning system. The air distribution is not regulated for the traditional satellite factory, which is designed under the worst condition. A large number of nozzles with supplying clean air are installed evenly on both sides of the wall to maintain the high cleanliness of the satellite factory. The rated air volume is supplied uninterruptedly to those nozzles by fans operated at a rated frequency, which results in a considerable energy consumption. Since the positions of the satellites are fixed, there is no need to maintain high cleanliness in the entire space. Some of the nozzles can be closed depending on the arrangement of satellites while still maintaining the cleanliness of local zones around the satellites. There are many typical scenarios during actual operation with different numbers and sizes of satellites, so which nozzles can be closed in these scenarios needs to be investigated. In this study, a satellite factory model was developed based on a real project and the numerical method was validated using test results. Several typical scenarios with different arrangement schemes of satellites were considered. The control strategy for each scenario was investigated, so that the effect of reducing air volume in typical scenarios and the whole year of satellites factory could be obtained. 2 Methods A CFD model of a satellite factory was developed and the numerical method was validated using the test values. Twenty-four cases under six typical scenarios with different numbers and sizes of satellites were set up to study the control strategy for the nozzles. 2.1 Physical model The facility investigated is used to store artificial earth satellites before they are launched. Fig. 1 shows the investigated satellite factory and the air supply system from a real project. The satellite factory is located in Beijing, China and the dimensions are is 90.9\u202fm (length)\u202f×\u202f24.0\u202fm (width)\u202f×\u202f21.9\u202fm (height). The design cleanliness level of the factory is ISO Class 8 and, so the limit for particle concentration is 3,520,000 pc/m3 (≥0.5\u202fµm) [16]. Fig. 2 a) shows the schematic of the air conditioning system. The filtered air is supplied through three rows of nozzles installed on the side walls (marked in red) and then discharged through the grilles installed on the lower portion of the side walls (marked in blue). The returned air finally enters the interlayer of the side walls and mixes with the outdoor air (marked in green). The mixed air is processed by the air handling unit and supplied into the cleanroom through the nozzles. Two nozzles share one air handling unit. The three rows of air supply nozzles are installed at heights of 4.7\u202fm, 10.3\u202fm, and 14.4\u202fm, respectively. For the bottom, middle and top rows, the number of nozzles is 58, 58 and 40, respectively, and the respective diameters of the nozzles are 375\u202fmm, 375\u202fmm, and 400\u202fmm. There are 40 grilles on both sides of the walls, and their size is 1.2\u202fm (length)\u202f×\u202f0.8\u202fm (height). The layout of the nozzles and grilles is symmetrical. Satellites are placed close to the side wall and their position is fixed. Fig. 2b) shows the detailed geometry of the satellite factory. The air volume of each nozzle in the bottom and middle rows is 2500\u202fm3/h, and the air volume of each nozzle at the top row is 3500\u202fm3/h. Each of the nozzles has fixed air volume and can switch on and off independently. The supplied air is treated by a high efficiency filter and the particle concentration of supply air can be regarded as 0 pc/m3. The main particle sources are the satellites, each with a particle release rate of 40 pc/(m2·s). This value was calculated using the average particle concentration and the total air volume of the satellite factory. The control target is the particle concentration in the zones within the distance of 0.5\u202fm from satellite surfaces, rather than the whole area of the factory, which is required less than 3,520,000 pc/m3 (≥0.5\u202fµm). The satellite factory is located in the inner zone. So, the heat conduction of internal walls is very small and ignored. The outdoor air introduced by the outdoor will be processed by the air handling unit and the temperature of supplied air is close to the air inside cleanroom. Thus, the airflow will not be affected by the outside temperature. As the heat dissipation of satellites is negligible and temperature requirements are not strict in a satellite factory, the simulation of temperature parameters is ignored in this study. 2.2 Mathematical model The standard k-ε model, which can predict the indoor airflow well and consumes less computing resources, is widely used in indoor air flow simulation [17\u201319]. Hence, it was used to predict the airflow in the satellite factory. Previous studies on indoor particles pointed out that the diffusion and transport properties of particles of size less than 2\u202fµm are similar to that of a passive gas [20,21]. Therefore, in this study, particles were regarded as gaseous pollutants being transported passively. The control equation used to calculate the concentration of particles is as follows: ∂ ∂ t C P + ∇ C P u j = D ∇ 2 ( C P ) + S P where C P is particle concentration (pc/m3); u j is the velocity of the air in the j direction (m/s); S P is the emission rate per unit volume of the particle source (pc/(m3 ∙ s)); D is diffusion coefficient (pc/(m2 ∙ s)). The above equation was discretized into algebraic equations using the finite volume method (FVM), with a second-order upwind scheme. The SIMPLE algorithm was adopted to solve the continuity and momentum equations. The Boussinesq model was employed to evaluate the buoyancy effect. The details of the numerical method can be found in Ref. [17,22\u201326]. 2.3 Grid independence test and validation The model used for the grid independence test is shown in Fig. 3 . Unstructured grids were applied in this study. They were denser in the regions near the walls, nozzles and surface of the satellites. The unstructured grids with medium cells (963,817) are shown in Fig. 4 . Three sets of grids consisting of 117,397 cells, 963,817 cells, and 4,830,157 cells, respectively, were chosen for the grid independence check. The velocity was presented along the selected line (X\u202f=\u202f45\u202fm; Z\u202f=\u202f10\u202fm), as shown in Fig. 5 . The result was similar for the grids with 963,817 cells and 4,830,157 cells, and different from that with 117,397 cells. Then, a grid convergence index GCI was used to report the results of grids convergence studies: G C I u = F s ε rms r p - 1 ε rms = ∑ i = 1 n ε i , u 2 n 1 2 where F s is a factor of safety, which is set as 1.25 in this study; p is theoretical order of convergence, which is 2 here. u is velocity magnitude (m/s); r is the ratio of fine gird to coarse grid. The calculated results of GCI index were shown in Table 1 . Fig. 6 shows the velocity contours with coarse, medium and fine grids. It can be seen that the airflow is similar between medium and fine grids, while the coarse grids are less accurate. Therefore, considering the computation time and sufficient accuracy, the grid with 963,817 cells was selected for the following study. The CFD model was validated before analysing the control strategies under different typical scenarios. It is difficult to test the airflow distribution in the satellite factory due to its confidential nature, so it was validated by the experiment in the published literature, Ref. [15]. The simulated airflow distributions were compared with experiments and the results are shown in Fig. 7 . It can be seen that the experiment and simulation agree well. The particle distribution was validated by the filed test. A numerical model was developed based on the real satellite factory. The particle counters were installed 1.5\u202fm above the ground and the particle concentration was measured in the field. Fig. 8 shows the position of the test points and the layout of the satellites. Simulation was performed and the particle concentrations at P1\u2013P5 were obtained. Fig. 9 shows that the simulation results were found to be in good agreement with the test results. The comparison results verified that the CFD model could correctly predict the particle concentration in the factory and it can be applied to the following analysis. 2.4 Case design There were a variety of scenarios in the actual operation of the satellite factory. Several typical scenarios were identified based on the number and size of satellites. For the number of satellites, low occupancy rate (6) and high occupancy rate (18) were considered. For the size of satellites, short satellites with dimensions of 5\u202fm (length)\u202f×\u202f5\u202fm (width)\u202f×\u202f8\u202fm (height), tall satellites with dimensions of 5\u202fm (length)\u202f×\u202f5\u202fm (width)\u202f×\u202f16.5\u202fm (height) and a combination of short and tall satellites were considered. Fig. 10 shows the following six scenarios that were set up: S1 (with 6 short satellites), S2 (with 18 short satellites), S3 (with 6 tall satellites), S4 (with 18 tall satellites), S5 (with 3 short\u202f+\u202f3 tall satellites), and S6 (with 9 short\u202f+\u202f9 tall satellites). The particle concentration around the satellites is the control target rather than whole space. It is not necessary to keep all the nozzles on for some scenarios. In order to know which nozzles need to be opened under different scenario, a number of cases were set up for each scenario to obtain a feasible control strategy. For the scenarios S1 and S2, the satellites are short and it is not necessary to open all three rows of nozzles. Three control strategies, opening the nozzles in the top and middle rows, opening the nozzles in the middle and bottom rows, and opening the nozzles in the bottom and top rows were considered. Case S1-T-D∞ and Case S2-T-D∞ represent opening all the nozzles of the top and middle rows for scenario S1 and scenario S2, respectively. Case S1-B-D∞ and Case S2-B-D∞ represent opening all the nozzles of the middle and bottom rows for scenario S1 and scenario S2, respectively. Case S1-M-D∞ and Case S2-M-D∞ represent opening all the nozzles of the top and bottom rows for scenario S1 and scenario S2, respectively. For the scenarios S3\u2013S6, there are several tall satellites and all three rows of nozzles are kept on so that the air supply can cover the satellites. Case S*-A-D∞ represents opening all the nozzles of the three rows for scenario S*. Furthermore, the positions of nozzle opening were considered. The nozzles within a certain distance from satellites were kept on and the others were closed. The distance between satellites and nozzles is defined as the distance from center of a nozzle to the section that crosses the center of a satellite in the\u202fX\u202fdirection. Opening nozzles within four different distances from the satellites (that is, D1\u2013D4, 2.5\u202fm, 5.5\u202fm, 8.5\u202fm and 11.5\u202fm), namely different ranges from the satellites, was considered. A total of 26 cases were used to investigate the control strategy for the nozzles, as listed in Table 2 . The first two rows of the table, opening different rows of nozzles, were used to determine which rows of nozzles need to be switched on. The distance from satellites D∞ within which the nozzles are opened is a maximum distance, which means all the nozzles in that row are opened. Other rows of the table were used to determine at which distance the nozzles need to be switched on. 3 Results and discussion The control strategy under different typical scenarios was simulated. The feasible control strategies for the rows of nozzles and the distances of nozzles were obtained by analyzing the results. Subsequently, the effect of reducing the circulating air volume in different scenarios was calculated. 3.1 Control strategy for the row of nozzles Fig. 11 shows the average particle concentration around the satellites when nozzles of different rows were opened. The gray represents the particle concentration when the nozzles in the middle and top rows were opened; the green represents the particle concentration when the nozzles in the bottom and middle rows were opened; the blue represents the particle concentration when the nozzles in the bottom and top rows were opened. Fig. 11 shows that when the nozzles in the bottom and middle rows were opened, the particle concentration was lower than the other two, opening the middle and top rows, opening the middle and top rows. In scenario S1, the particle concentration when the nozzles in the lower two rows were opened was 12.8% lower than when the nozzles in the upper two rows were opened, and 12.0% lower than when the nozzles in the bottom and top rows were opened. In scenario S2, the particle concentration when the nozzles in the lower two rows were opened was 10% lower than when the nozzles in the upper two rows were opened, and 12.4% lower than when the nozzles in the bottom and top rows were opened. Thus, for the scenarios where the satellites are short, it is feasible to open the nozzles only in the bottom and middle rows. 3.2 Control strategy for the distance of nozzles The average particle concentration around the satellites when the nozzles within different distance from the satellite were opened, namely different range from satellites, is shown in Fig. 12 . The dotted lines represent scenarios with short satellite occupancy, and solid lines represent scenarios with tall satellite occupancy. The brown line is the average particle concentration around the satellites as the range of open nozzles increased in scenario S1. Similarly, the gray, red, blue, yellow, and green lines represent the concentration changes in scenarios S2, S3, S4, S5 and S6, respectively. For the cases with a low occupancy of satellites, which are represented by the brown, red and yellow lines, the particle concentration decreased rapidly when the range of open nozzles increased from 2.5\u202fm to 5.5\u202fm. All the reductions were more than 45% while the concentration was still within the requirements. With further increase in the open nozzles\u2019 range, the change in particle concentration was not significant. Even when all the nozzles in the selected rows were opened, that is, the range of open nozzles increased to the maximum value (54.5\u202fm), the reduction of particle concentration was not obvious. Thus, considering both cleanliness and energy consumption, opening the nozzles within 5.5\u202fm of satellites was a preferable strategy for scenarios S1, S3, and S5. For the cases with a high occupancy of satellites, which are represented by the gray, blue, and green lines, the open nozzles\u2019 range is from 2.5 to 8.5\u202fm. In these scenarios, opening the nozzles within 5.5\u202fm or 8.5\u202fm of the satellites meant that all the nozzles of selected rows are opened. The particle concentration when the nozzles within 5.5\u202fm of satellites were opened was significantly lower than that within 2.5\u202fm. Taking cleanliness into account, opening the nozzles within 5.5\u202fm of satellites was a preferable strategy for scenarios S2, S4, and S6. Based on the analysis of the above-mentioned six scenarios above, the optimal strategies for adjusting nozzles according to the number and size of satellites were obtained. The specific strategies for different scenarios are summarized in Table 3 . 3.3 Effect analysis of reducing circulating air volume According to the above analysis, the optimal strategy for each scenario was obtained through the analysis of 26 cases. In those six optimal strategies, nozzles in different rows and at different positions were closed to reduce air volume. Fig. 13 shows the circulating air volume for the six optimal cases. The green bar represents scenarios with a low occupancy of satellites and the blue represents scenarios with a high occupancy of satellites. Case S1-B-D2 and Case S2-B-D2 are short satellite scenarios. Case S5-A-D2 and Case S6-A-D2 are short\u202f+\u202ftall satellite scenarios. Case S3-A-D2 and Case S4-A-D2 are tall satellite scenarios. The optimal strategy of adjusting nozzles according to the number and size of satellites can reduce air volume significantly. According to the results, the circulating air volume with the optimal strategy was 1.05\u202f×\u202f105 m3/h, 2.9\u202f×\u202f105 m3/h, 1.33\u202f×\u202f105 m3/h, 3.88\u202f×\u202f105 m3/h, 1.58\u202f×\u202f105 m3/h, and 4.3\u202f×\u202f105 m3/h for scenarios S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, and S6, respectively. The air volume was reduced by 75.6%, 32.6%, 69.1%, 9.8%, 63.3%, and 0% compared with the traditional method of keeping all the nozzles on. For the scenarios with low occupancy of satellites, more nozzles could be closed than for those with high occupancy. The required circulating air volume in S1-B-D2, S5-A-D2, and S3-A-D2 is 63.8%, 65.7%, and 63.2%, respectively, which is less than that in S2-B-D2, S6-A-D2, and S4-A-D2. For the scenarios with short satellites, more nozzles could also be closed and less air volume was needed. The required air volume in Cases S1-B-D2 and S2-B-D2 was only two thirds of that in Cases S3-A-D2 and S4-A-D2. Based on the analysis above, the optimal control strategy showed significant reduction in circulating air volume for most scenarios. The occurrence probabilities of scenarios S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, and S6 are 24%, 16%, 24%, 16%, 12%, and 8%, respectively, according to the actual situation of the satellite factory over a year. Thus, the air volume with the optimal strategy can be reduced by 49.1% in a year when compared with that of the unregulated strategy. The reduction of air volume will significantly reduce the energy consumption of the fan. The power of the fan can be calculated as follow: W = P ∗ Q η and P = P f + S Q 2 where Q is air volume (m3/h); η is efficiency of fan; P is total circulating resistance (Pa); P f is resistance of high efficiency filter (Pa), which is set as 100\u202fPa; S Q 2 represents the rest of the resistance (Pa), which is set as 30\u202fPa. The air volume is reduced by 49.1% with new strategy. The total circulation resistance can be reduced by 17%, and the energy consumption of the fan can be reduced by 57.8%. 4 Conclusion High amount of circulating air volume is used to ensure cleanliness and due to the lack of adjustment of air supply in the actual satellite factory, which leads to a large amount of energy consumption. In this study, a CFD model was developed according to a real project of a satellite factory and was validated using the data from field tests. Twenty-six cases for six typical scenarios were simulated, and optimal strategies of adjusting nozzles according to the number and size of satellites were obtained. The effect of reducing circulating air volume for each scenario was presented and the reduction in the total air volume for a year was calculated. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) When the size of the satellites in the factory are relatively short, it is feasible to open only two of the three rows of nozzles to ensure the cleanliness around satellites, and the strategy of opening the nozzles in the bottom and middle rows is optimal. (2) Preferable strategies of nozzles for six typical scenarios were obtained. Considering both cleanliness and energy consumption, opening the nozzles within 5.5\u202fm from satellites can achieve the required cleanliness with less air volume. (3) The strategy of adjusting nozzles according to the number and size of satellites can reduce air volume significantly. The required air volume is less when the number of satellites is low or the size is short. The total air volume for a year can be reduced by 49.1% when compared with that of the traditional method. The energy consumption of the fan can be reduced by 57.8%. CRediT authorship contribution statement Jiaan Zhao: Methodology, Writing - review & editing. Yuan Liu: Investigation.

The cleanliness of the satellite factory is maintained by an air-conditioning system consisting of three rows of nozzles installed on the side walls of the factory. Traditionally, all the nozzles are operated at a rated air volume regardless of the arrangement of the satellites, which results in a high energy consumption by the air circulating fans. In this study, we proposed a control method for the nozzles, based on the number and size of satellites. A CFD model was developed to simulate the cleanliness in the satellite factory and the cleanliness for different scenarios with different sizes and numbers of satellites was simulated. The control strategy and rate of reduction of the circulating air volume was obtained for different arrangements of satellites. The results show that the less circulating air volume is required when the number of satellites is small or the size is short. The total air volume can be reduced by 49.1% for a year and the energy consumption of the fan can be reduced 57.8%. This study provides a feasible method to reduce the circulating air volume, which can be used to guide the design and operation of actual projects.",
