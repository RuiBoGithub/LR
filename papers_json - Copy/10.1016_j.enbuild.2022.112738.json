Non-dispersive infrared absorption spectroscopy (NDIR)-based CO2 sensors currently dominate the market for building applications. Yet, the affordable ones are frequently found to have a reading that deviates from the actual CO2 concentration, which hinders the proper operation of the demand control ventilation (DCV). This study aims to propose a compensation method to mitigate the CO2 sensor deviation due to water vapor interference. Its energy implication is simulated afterward by creating a 464 m2 office space model equipped with the DCV in EnergyPlus. Per the results of multiple standard gas experiments performed in a controlled environment, the proposed model has a coefficient of determination R 2 = 0.899 , and is able to reduce the normalized root mean square error from 8.1 % (before compensation) to 2.6 % (after compensation) for a selected NDIR CO2 sensor, showing a 67.9 % reduction. Meanwhile, the tested sensor is originally prone to underestimate the CO2 concentration, leading to less ventilation rate in DCV. As a result, there will be a 6.97 % increment in the annual ventilation electricity load of the modeled building after compensation, but in exchange for a better controlled indoor CO2 concentration that was underestimated by 3.0 to 13.1 % (on average 7.9 %) depending on zone conditions before compensation.

Among numerous factors influencing the overall IEQ, indoor air quality (IAQ), thermal comfort, visual environment, and acoustic environment are four major areas thus being selected as primary components in the recently developed IEQ evaluation tool \u201cIEQCompass\u201d [2]. Between these factors, maintaining a high-quality visual and acoustic environment is most of a design problem or an engineering issue to be fixed with less impact on building energy consumption. On the other hand, in order to maintain an ideal IAQ, the concentration of indoor air pollutants that are recognized to impact occupant health adversely [3] must be suppressed to an acceptable level. In the current state of art, technologies for removing various pollutants from the air do exist, such as using the absorption method to capture carbon dioxide (CO2) [4] and formaldehyde (HCHO) [5], and other volatile organic compounds (VOC) [6], or using the filtering method to remove small particulate matters with a diameter 2.5 µm or less (PM 2.5) [7]. However, despite the existence of these advanced technologies, using a ventilation system to draft in outside air to dilute indoor air pollutants remains a simple, economical yet total solution that is widely applied in most of the existing buildings. The major drawback of this dilution approach is that it requires a significant amount of outside air to be introduced into the building. If the weather differs from the indoor air condition, it causes a considerable amount of ventilation load that certainly burdens the building's Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system. A previous study has demonstrated that in office buildings, ventilation alone could form up to 12 % of the overall energy consumption [8]. As a result, methods to reduce the ventilation load have been researching interests; this can be as simple as adopting a pre-defined occupancy schedule or a more complicated method like motion sensor-based ventilation. Today, one of the most promising approaches is demand control ventilation (DCV), which has been studied extensively with a wide range of literature available [9\u201311]. The concept of demand control ventilation has been well described as \u201ca ventilation strategy where the airflow rate is governed by a chosen pollutant concentration level\u201d [12], in which picking the most appropriate target pollutant is essential for a successful DCV implementation. Previous studies have examined the performance of the DCVs based on different pollutants, including Radon-based DCV [13], VOC-based DCV [14], Humidity-based DCV [15], PM2.5-based DCV [16], and also the most frequently studied CO2-based DCV [17\u201319]. Among these various types of DCVs, CO2-based DCV is the most common design because occupants consume oxygen and generate CO2 [20], so CO2 excels as a reasonable indicator of occupancy density which is significant in modulating the ventilation rate. The control of a CO2-based DCV system is reasonably straightforward: the ventilation rate is adjusted according to the difference between a pre-defined set-point and the feedback signal from an in-field CO2 sensor. It is worth mentioning that although 1000 ppm is commonly referred to as a typical CO2 set-point and is certainly recommended by the widely recognized ASHRAE standard 62.1 [21], it is not always a strict building code, and some flexibility exists. In fact, ASHRAE standard 62.1 already provides three different approaches as a valid basis of design, including ventilation rate, indoor air quality, and natural ventilation procedure. Like all other feedback control systems, the sensor's accuracy is crucial in implementing proper control. Based on the sensing mechanism, CO2 sensors can be roughly classified as optical and electrochemical sensors. However, the latter tend to suffer from limited measurement accuracy and problems of long-time stability [22]. As a result, it is observed that optical CO2 sensors are more frequently selected in practical applications, especially those based on non-dispersive infrared absorption spectroscopy (NDIR), which has considerable advantages, including cheaper cost, smaller size, and easier process control [23]. A previous study even found that 83 % of the total advanced CO2 sensors are based on the NDIR technique [24]. An NDIR CO2 sensor basically works under the Lambert-Beer law, which mathematically describes the ratio between the infrared radiation intensities before and after passing through the target gas as a function of wavelength-dependent absorption coefficient, path length, and gas concentration [25]. Suppose the target gas can be identified to have a peak absorption at a certain wavelength band while no other gases absorb at the same band. In that case, the target gas concentration can be derived by measuring the infrared radiation intensities at the inlet and outlet of a pre-design testing channel/chamber at that wavelength band. For CO2, the peak infrared absorption bands are found to be around 2.7 and 4.26 μ m [26]. Unfortunately, these two bands are not exclusive to CO2 and water vapor, which was found to have a significant absorption from 2 to 8 μ m , produces a considerable interference due to its high concentration in the air [27]. To address this issue, various solutions have been proposed. For example, using the multilayer film optical filter as the infrared (IR) bandpass filter is found to be a possible solution but increases the price of the NDIR CO2 sensor [27]. On the other hand, a study also demonstrated that it is possible to model the interference from water vapor starting from the fundamental Lambert-Beer law [28]. The vapor interference issue becomes particularly severe when there is a possibility of condensation in the measurement environment, in which the condensed water may adhere to the inner surface of the sensor and not dissipate for a long time, causing measurement deviations. Meanwhile, NDIR CO2 sensors are known to be influenced by ambient temperature and pressure, both of which have been shown to affect the absorption spectrum range and the absorption intensity of carbon dioxide. To address the issues mentioned above, a previous study [29] proposed applying super hydrophobic transparent coating on the sensor as well as the pressure and temperature compensation. The sensor measurement deviations were proven to be less than 2.5 % FS after applying all the above options. Other than environmental interferences, NDIR CO2 sensors might also have aging problems themselves. For example, a previous study [30] investigated five commercial NDIR CO2 sensors and found linear relationships between sensor deviation and length of use, ambient temperature, and pressure. The sensor deviations were significantly reduced on four of the five sensors, with a particularly successful one having more than 83 % reduction (24 % before and 4 % after compensation) in sensor deviation after applying all the proposed compensations. It is worth noting that in practical building applications, each individual zone shall have its dedicated CO2 sensor to ensure proper zonal air quality control. Some building projects have their CO2 sensor installed in the main return air duct right next to the air handler unit (AHU), which actually measures the CO2 concentration of the mixed return air from different zones. This approach does not guarantee an acceptable CO2 level in the multi-zone scenario. For example, considering an AHU serving ten private offices and a conference room, when all employees leave their private offices and gather in the conference room on Monday morning, the sensor installed in the main return air duct may find a pretty decent CO2 level in the mixed return air. However, the actual CO2 level of the conference room is probably extremely high. Due to the bulky demand for CO2 sensors in building applications, choosing less-pricey CO2 sensors seems a relatively feasible option. Unfortunately, per the authors\u2019 project experiences, readings from commercial affordable NDIR CO2 sensors frequently deviate from the actual CO2 concentration level, which either impacts the building efficiency because the DCV will be instructed to pull in excessive outside air, or the air quality will be compromised. However, it must be noted that these CO2 sensors might have been properly lab-calibrated, and many already have a temperature-based compensation per the specification, so it remains puzzling why the measurement deviation only appears in practical applications. One explanation is that the practical environment consists of additional sources that cause interferences; if that is the case, water vapor is likely the most suspected due to its relatively high concentration in the air. Thus, the main goal of this study is to develop a procedure to compensate for a CO2 sensor to mitigate interference from water vapor. Unlike other studies focusing on an underlying compensation mechanism that is more useful in the sensor manufacturing process, this study focuses on developing a compensation algorithm specifically for a finished sensor with final readings only. As it stands now, many buildings are already equipped with CO2-based DCV, and a wide range of savings has been reported in previous studies [11,31,32]. However, the energy impact of a faulty CO2 sensor was often overlooked. Therefore, the other objective of this study aims to address the important but less discussed question of how much of an energy impact is if a biased CO2 sensor guides the DCV while proposing a cost-effective solution to eliminating such energy impact. In summary, the objective of this study aims to develop a reference model to compensate for the existing deviation in a commercially affordable finished NDIR CO2 sensor and quantify the energy impact of the compensated sensor as if it is applied to a DCV. The quantified result can be used as a reference in the decision-making process of whether or not to perform a sensor retrofit. More importantly, by doing this, indoor air quality can be properly controlled at an acceptable level in a more energy-efficient fashion. 2 Methodology The workflow of this study starts from proposing a simplified CO2 sensor model and building a chamber as a controlled environment to performing standard gas experiments to verify the proposed model. After that, the annual energy impact from the compensation will be evaluated based on a virtual office building, which will be described in the later section. 2.1 The simplified CO2 sensor model In order to determine the interference intensity from water vapor, its concentration should be resolved first. By assuming air is an ideal gas, the water vapor concentration, or specifically the molar fraction of the vapor in the air y v , can be calculated per the psychrometric laws, starting with determining the saturation water vapor pressure at a specific temperature using the following equation [33]: (1) P ws , T = e x p [ C 8 T + C 9 + C 10 ∗ T + C 11 ∗ T 2 + C 12 ∗ T 3 + C 13 ln ( T ) ] Where: C8 = -5.8002206E + 03 C9 = 1.3914993E + 00 C10 = -4.8640239E-02 C11 = 4.1764768E-05 C12 = -1.4452093E-08 C13 = 6.5459673E + 00 The water vapor pressure is then calculated using the measured relative humidity ∅ per the following equation [33]: (2) P v = ∅ ∙ P ws , T Lastly, the molar fraction of the vapor in the air y v can then be determined using Dalton\u2019s law [34]: (3) y v = P v P a In this study, it is assumed that the CO2 sensor deviation is partly due to the interference from water vapor molecules. Clearly, a fixed amount of vapor molecules might generate negligible interference under high CO2 concentration conditions but significant interference when the CO2 concentration is relatively low. Thus, the concept of the vapor-CO2 ratio R v and equivalent interference from water vapor I w are adopted here. A simplified example is illustrated in Fig. 1 to explain the proposed model further. In the above figure, the bottom case (b) represents an NDIR sensing process in which the IR beam passes through a tunnel filled with gas (1000 ppm CO2) to be tested. The intensity of the IR beam will be reduced before it reaches the IR detector due to the absorption of CO2 so that the signal processor can calculate the intensity reduction and extrapolate the CO2 concentration. It is worth mentioning that the intensity of the IR beam is temperature dependent, so a temperature-based compensation is required and assumed as a built-in function of the signal processor. Since no interference exists in this case, the CO2 level measured ( y c o 2 , m \u2032 ) by a properly designed sensor should reflect the actual CO2 concentration (specifically the molar fraction of the carbon dioxide in the air, y c o 2 , a ), which can be expressed as the following equation: (4) y c o 2 , m \u2032 = y c o 2 , a ( w i t h o u t i n t e r f e r e n c e ) On the other hand, the top case (a) in the figure represents a similar NDIR sensing process, and the sole difference is now the gas to be tested contains not only 1000 ppm of CO2 but also a certain concentration of water vapor y v that in combination can absorb the same amount of IR radiation as 1300 ppm of CO2. Note that the actual CO2 concentration in both cases is the same, but the CO2 reading of case (a) will be 1300 ppm, which is 130 % of case (b). From a molecular perspective, the 30 % sensor deviation is due to the presence of water vapor. It has to be noted that the amount of water vapor is not 30 % of the amount of CO2 since their absorbance is different. Here a coefficient k is added to address the absorbance difference so that k ∙ y v can be considered the equivalent CO2 concentration. At this moment, the ratio of equivalent CO2 concentration in case (a) to case (b) can be written as follows, where R v is the aforementioned vapor-CO2 ratio: (5) y c o 2 , a + k · y v y c o 2 , a ⏟ Equivalent C O 2 concentration ratio o f c a s e a to c a s e b = 1 + k · R v = y c o 2 , m y c o 2 , m \u2032 ⏟ Sensor reading ratio o f case a to c a s e b (6) R v = y v y c o 2 , a By rearranging equation (5) and replacing y c o 2 , m \u2032 by y c o 2 , a per equation (4), the following equation can be derived: (7) y c o 2 , m y c o 2 , m \u2032 - 1 = y c o 2 , m - y c o 2 , a y c o 2 , a = k ∙ R v = I w Where I w is the aforementioned equivalent interference from water vapor, and the term y c o 2 , m - y c o 2 , a y c o 2 , a is the normalized sensor deviation (denoted as E). It is worth noting that the above equation only considers water vapor-related interference, and there might be interferences from other sources. With a similar concept, I o represents the equivalent interference from other sources and is added to the equation. As a result, the final equation can be written as follows: (8) E = y c o 2 , m - y c o 2 , a y c o 2 , a ⏟ Normalized sensor deviation = k · R υ ⏟ Equivalent int e r f e r e n c e from w a t e r vapour , I w + I o ⏟ Equivalent int e r f e r e n c e from o t h e r sources Here I o is assumed constant in the standard gas experiments at different CO2 concentration levels in a controlled environment, which will be described in the next section. By doing this, both k and I o are coefficients to be determined. Once these two values are known, then the actual CO2 concentration y c o 2 , a can be calculated by equation (9) with calculated vapor ( y v ) and measured CO2 ( y c o 2 , m ) concentrations as inputs. The physical interpretation of this equation is that the normalized CO2 sensor deviation E is proportional to the vapor-CO2 concentration ratio R v under the model proposed. Since it is desired to let the compensated CO2 concentration y c o 2 , c close to y c o 2 , a , thus, the following equation derived from equations (7) and (8) can be applied to calculate the compensated CO2 concentration: (9) y c o 2 , c = 100 100 + E × y c o 2 , m 2.2 The standard gas experiment configuration The purpose of the standard gas experiment is to evaluate the impact of temperature and humidity variations on the selected sensors under different CO2 concentrations. In order to achieve this goal, standard gas is pumped into an experiment chamber with CO2 sensors inside, as shown in Fig. 2 . Four cylinders of CO2-Air gas mixture with varying CO2 concentrations are purchased externally (from CHEN FON Co. ltd.) as the standard gas. Each cylinder can provide enough gas mixtures for two rounds of experiments. That is, eight experiments (two for each specific CO2 concentration), as listed in Table 1 , are performed under an identical procedure described in the following paragraph. The experiment chamber is built as a controlled environment with a dimension of 1010x510x510mm (LxWxH), as shown in Fig. 3 . Inside the chamber, a water-to-air heat exchanger connected with an isothermal water bath supplying a constant 16 °C cooling water serves as the cooling unit. In contrast, two electrical heaters (800 W × 2) serve as the heating unit. With the cooling unit always on, a digital temperature controller (TTP-P9, TOHO, Accuracy: ±0.3 % +1 digit) with a solid-state relay controls the heating unit to modulate the in-chamber temperature. Meanwhile, one temperature (K type, Accuracy: ±0.75 %), one relative humidity (JTC-H03S, Jetec, Accuracy: ±3.0 %), and one selected NDIR CO2 sensor with built-in temperature compensation (HSTL-CO2, China Union, Accuracy: 40 ppm ± 3.0 %, t90 response time: 120 s) are installed nearby in the chamber to measure the relevant data. One absolute pressure sensor (SB-100, Apogee, USA) is also installed for monitoring purposes to ensure that the whole experiments are conducted at atmospheric pressure. Each experiment begins with a two-step purge process to exhaust the residual air inside the chamber. In the first step of the process, an aspirator (A-1000S, EYELA, Japan) connecting to vent-2 is switched on, and vent-1 is closed while the standard gas is supplied at a flow rate of 10 L per minute (LPM) under a static pressure of 1.5 kg/cm2. This step lasts three minutes. After that, the aspirator is turned off, and the chamber pressure is monitored continuously. Once the pressure rises back to 1 atm, the second step of the purge process begins with an 8.5 LPM standard gas flow rate and an opened vent-1; this step continues until the CO2 reading becomes stable, which takes approximately 60 min. During the whole purge process, the chamber temperature is controlled at 20 °C. After the purge process, the standard gas flow rate is lowered to 1.8 LPM for ten minutes, with only vent-1 staying open to serve as a relief vent. Then the temperature is manipulated by the aforementioned digital temperature controller with a preloaded temperature set-point schedule, as shown in Fig. 4 . In brief, the temperature varies between 20 and 45 °C with a 15-minute isothermal period after each temperature change to obtain a steady-state response. A data logger (TRM-20, TOHO, Accuracy: ±0.3 % +1 digit) is then utilized to record all relevant data during the steady-state period, including temperature, relative humidity, and CO2 concentrations. Since the purchased gas is delivered in the form of compressed gas cylinders with very little water, two cups of water (500 ml x2) are placed in the chamber as a supplementary moisture source. 2.3 The energy implication of applying the compensation algorithm to the DCV\u2019s CO2 sensor To estimate the energy impact caused by the CO2 sensor deviation, a single-story office building with 464 m 2 floor area (29x16 m) is modeled using the famous building energy simulation program EnergyPlus (with Openstudio as frontend). As shown in Fig. 5 , The whole building is divided into five zones, including four perimeter zones (PZ East, PZ South, PZ West, and PZ North, respectively) and one interior zone (IZ Middle). The building is assumed to be located in Taipei, Taiwan, a city with a hot and humid climate. The Typical Meteorological Year (TMY3) dataset of Taipei downloaded from the EnergyPlus website is utilized as the site weather. The building operates from 8 AM to 5 PM, Monday through Friday, while the HVAC system is ON from 7 AM to 6 PM. Unless otherwise mentioned, the building model is created using the built-in whole-building small office template corresponding to the baseline model described in ASHRAE 90.1 appendix G [35]. Key building assumptions/configurations are summarized in Table 2 . The energy impact of applying the compensation algorithm to the CO2 sensor controlling the modeled building\u2019s DCV is then calculated with a script linked to EnergyPlus by the following procedure: Determine the qualified hours based on the HVAC system schedule (7 AM to 6 PM, Monday through Friday, 3120 h in total in a year). 4. For each qualified hour, calculate the zonal hourly sensor deviation E z , t per the simulated zone conditions using the proposed compensation. Thus, there will be five values in each qualified hour, one for each zone defined as in Fig. 5. The zonal hourly ventilation flow rate penalty Q \u2032 z , t is calculated per the following equation: (10) Q \u2032 z , t = Q z , t × ( E z , t E z , t - 1 ) Where Q z , t is the zonal hourly ventilation flow rate reported by the EnergyPlus. The annual ventilation electricity impact EP yearly in kWh is then calculated by the following equation: (11) EP yearly = ∑ t = 1 3120 ∑ z = 1 5 Q \u2032 z , t × ( h OA , t - h z , t ) COP z , t × S AE , z , t (12) S AE , z t = 1 w h e n t h e a i r s i d e e c o n o m i z e r c y c l e i s o f f 0 w h e n t h e a i r s i d e e c o n o m i z e r c y c l e i s o n Where S AE , z t is the hourly airside economizer cycle operation status for a specific RTU serving its corresponding zone. It is for excluding the hours when the airside economizer cycle is activated since DCV no longer controls the outside air during that period. 3 Results and discussions The results are presented in two parts. The first part shows the compensation model derived from experimental results. The second part shows the simulated energy implication of applying the compensation model to the CO2 sensors in the modeled office building. 3.1 The compensation model The absolute error and relative uncertainty under various standard gas CO2 concentrations of the experiments are calculated and summarized in Table 3 . In order to verify the proposed model assumptions that the normalized CO2 sensor deviation E is proportional to the vapor-CO2 concentration ratio R v , the E - R v scatter diagram is plotted in Fig. 6 . A significant linear relationship can be observed in the figure, which conforms to the proposed model. Meanwhile, a multiple linear regression model is implemented using R language to determine the coefficients k and I o . As a result, the normalized sensor deviation E can be expressed as the following equation, with a coefficient of determination R 2 = 0.899 : (13) E = 0.503 R v - 17.34 The result is interesting and worth further discussion. First of all, the term I o is negative, which seems against the proposed model at first glance since any interferences are supposed to be positive. This issue can be explained by the fact that the term I o covers all but vapor-related factors affecting the sensor readings, including the intentional signal level adjustment. Suppose the sensor design might be affected by the water vapor. In that case, the manufacturer can assume a likely practical condition and make a signal level pre-adjustment to cancel the vapor interference in that condition. Per the regression results shown in equation (13) E approaches zero when R v is approximately 34.5. If the CO2 concentration is at 455 ppm, the vapor concentration can be calculated as 15,698 ppm, which closely meets the condition of 25 °C and 50 % RH \u2013 a common indoor set-point. However, this is merely speculation, and verifying it is out of the scope of this study. Still, the negative I o is likely from the signal level pre-adjustment. It is worth mentioning that the compensation model is applicable only to the selected sensor. By looking into the model, it can be easily found that the manufacturer signal level pre-adjustment plays a crucial role in the sensor deviation. It means that the proposed compensation procedure should be recommended by certain standards to be applied to every sensor model. Otherwise, promoting its practical application will be somehow difficult. By applying equation (13) to compensate for the measured CO2 concentration, the normalized root mean square error before and after compensation (denoted as NRMSE m and NRMSE c , respectively) are calculated as 8.1 % and 2.6 % per the following equations (14) and (15). That is, the compensation algorithm is able to decrease the mean sensor deviation by 67.9 %. Meanwhile, the normalized mean biased error before and after compensation (denoted as NMBE m and NMBE c , respectively) are calculated as −7.9 % and −0.2 % per the following equations (16) and (17). (14) NRMSE m = 1 y ¯ c o 2 , m 1 N ∑ i = 1 N ( y ¯ c o 2 , m - y ¯ c o 2 , a ) 2 i (15) NRMSE c = 1 y ¯ c o 2 , c 1 N ∑ i = 1 N ( y ¯ c o 2 , c - y ¯ c o 2 , a ) 2 i (16) NMBE m = 1 N ∑ i = 1 N ( y ¯ c o 2 , m - y ¯ c o 2 , a ) i y ¯ c o 2 , m (17) NMBE c = 1 N ∑ i = 1 N ( y ¯ c o 2 , c - y ¯ c o 2 , a ) i y ¯ c o 2 , c As a limitation of this study, it has to be specifically mentioned that the energy impact summarized above is only applicable to the sensor tested. Per the authors\u2019 experiences, some affordable CO2 sensors underestimate the in-field CO2 concentration while others do just the opposite. Whether the compensation algorithm brings energy savings or penalties will depend on the sensor\u2019s behavior before compensation. This study merely tries to develop a procedure to compensate for a finished CO2 sensor and estimate the accompanying energy consumption difference. Meanwhile, this algorithm also only applies to the sensors with built-in temperature compensation, which is likely the case for most properly designed NDIR CO2 sensors since the IR intensity is influenced by temperature. 3.2 The simulated energy implication of applying the compensation model By using the output variables from the building energy model, the zonal hourly normalized sensor deviation E z , t can be calculated using a combination of equations (1), 2, 3, 6, and 13. The hourly normalized sensor deviation range is shown in Fig. 7 . The minimum and maximum sensor deviation within a year are −3.0 % and −13.1 %, respectively, with an average of −7.9 %. The annual ventilation electricity impact EP yearly is calculated following the procedure described in section 2.3, while the ventilation electricity load before applying the proposed sensor compensation is obtained directly from the building energy model. The monthly ventilation electricity load is compared in Fig. 8 , and the annual results are summarized in Table 4 . It can be found in Fig. 7 that the selected sensor underestimates all zonal CO2 levels of the modeled building for the whole year if. It means the ventilation flow will increase in exchanging a more correctly controlled CO2 level once the sensor is compensated. Generally, the sensor deviations are larger in the Winter months, resulting in a larger increase in ventilation flow after compensation. However, an increased ventilation flow actually helps cool the building when the outdoor specific enthalpy is lower than the indoor specific enthalpy, which frequently occurs in winter. Even if this is not the case, the outdoor specific enthalpy often exceeds indoor specific enthalpy by a much smaller margin in winter. As a result, the monthly ventilation electricity load penalty is more significant in summer than in winter months, as shown in Fig. 8. It is worth noticing that each zone has a different normalized sensor deviation at the same hour because their zonal humidity ratio is not the same, which happens to be a common phenomenon in buildings without adequate humidity control mechanisms. In most modern buildings, one HVAC system simultaneously performs the tasks of dehumidification and cooling while being merely controlled by a thermostat. Although the engineer might be able to estimate a sensible heat ratio (SHR) at a design condition and manipulate the supply air temperature to provide corresponding sensible and latent cooling capacity, in reality, the building rarely operates at design condition, and the variations of SHR, particularly in perimeter zones, might be significant in one day, let alone in a year. As a result, the zonal humidity is not likely to be controlled at the same level at the same time, thus the sensors in different zones need to be compensated separately per their respective surrounding conditions. One limitation of this study is that in addition to the CO2 sensor, the proposed compensation algorithm also requires temperature and relative humidity readings; however, installing extra sensors might be against the low-cost restriction. Luckily, in the modern internet of things (IoT) era, data exchange between sensors has never before been as easy and affordable as it is now. For example, an IoT module (microcontroller developer board fully integrated with wi-fi and analog input functions) already costs less than two U.S. dollars each. So it is completely feasible to utilize such a module to transmit the readings of the adjacent temperature and humidity sensors to the CO2 sensor for compensation through wi-fi, which is an infrastructure basically equipped by all modern buildings; In that case, no extra sensors will be required. 4 Future work The proposed compensation method is currently tested with a single model of CO2 sensor, thus is better to be treated as a starting point of research for developing a generally applicable compensation procedure that shows promising potential in a limited-scale experiment. Researchers worldwide are encouraged to apply and examine this method on their NDIR sensors in the future. 5 Conclusions In this study, a model to compensate for a finished CO2 sensor to mitigate the interference from water vapor is proposed and verified by performing standard gas experiments in a controlled environment. The experiment results indicate that for the selected CO2 sensor and within the tested CO2 concentration range (400 ∼ 2000 ppm), the normalized sensor deviation is proportional to the vapor-CO2 ratio with an R 2 = 0.899 . Meanwhile, the normalized root mean square error before and after compensation are 8.1 % and 2.6 %, respectively, showing a 67.9 % reduction due to the compensation. In order to estimate the energy implication of applying the compensation algorithm to a DCV\u2019s CO2 sensor, a 464 m2 office space located in a hot and humid climate is modeled in EnergyPlus. Because the selected sensor is originally prone to underestimate the in-field CO2 concentration leading to less ventilation rate in DCV; as a result, there will be a 6.97 % ventilation electricity load penalty in a year on the modeled building after compensation. It is worth noting that this result is not deterministic, and the proposed compensation may bring in energy savings if the sensor initially has an overestimating behavior. In summary, the proposed compensation model is proven able to reduce the NDIR CO2 sensor deviation significantly, meaning it can either result in energy savings or correct the CO2 concentration level control when applied to a DCV\u2019s feedback sensor. Furthermore, it can be easily implemented with the help of IoT technology at an affordable cost, which might be worth integrating into the future design of the NDIR-based CO2 sensor.

        "dc:description": "Non-dispersive infrared absorption spectroscopy (NDIR)-based CO2 sensors currently dominate the market for building applications. Yet, the affordable ones are frequently found to have a reading that deviates from the actual CO2 concentration, which hinders the proper operation of the demand control ventilation (DCV). This study aims to propose a compensation method to mitigate the CO2 sensor deviation due to water vapor interference. Its energy implication is simulated afterward by creating a 464 m2 office space model equipped with the DCV in EnergyPlus. Per the results of multiple standard gas experiments performed in a controlled environment, the proposed model has a coefficient of determination R 2 = 0.899 , and is able to reduce the normalized root mean square error from 8.1 % (before compensation) to 2.6 % (after compensation) for a selected NDIR CO2 sensor, showing a 67.9 % reduction. Meanwhile, the tested sensor is originally prone to underestimate the CO2 concentration, leading to less ventilation rate in DCV. As a result, there will be a 6.97 % increment in the annual ventilation electricity load of the modeled building after compensation, but in exchange for a better controlled indoor CO2 concentration that was underestimated by 3.0 to 13.1 % (on average 7.9 %) depending on zone conditions before compensation.",
